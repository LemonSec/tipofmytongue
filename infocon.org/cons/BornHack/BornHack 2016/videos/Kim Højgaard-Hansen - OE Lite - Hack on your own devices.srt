1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thanks hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody and so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a at</font>

2
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,890
talk that's a little bit with two rather

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit separate but also very much</font>

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:33,480
combined sub sub sub topics and so first

5
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:36,030
of all it's a illustration of how a

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,559
project that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm involved it called oh</font>

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,500
we light can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used for our kind of</font>

8
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:48,000
people's purposes of actually producing

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:51,510
fully working software stacks for for

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,360
embedded devices and and then it's also

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,968
like an example project that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using</font>

12
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,430
it for myself trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to demonstrate to</font>

13
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,870
you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is actually somewhat</font>

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:07,110
usable and the project<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like a</font>

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,780
completely idealistic crazy thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,140
it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be possible to just completely</font>

17
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,250
take over the control of some of the

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,470
stuff that's running in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> house and</font>

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">in my case I have been annoyed for years</font>

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,280
about crappy vendor routers and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

21
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,229
restrictions on software and having to

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw out perfectly good working</font>

23
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:31,770
hardware and stuff like that so I've

24
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,270
taken on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the task of actually trying to</font>

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,240
build something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can maintain and</font>

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,850
that I'm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> full control of and it</font>

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:45,630
should also be at a reasonable price so

28
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:49,829
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> this crazy named banana</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pie r 1</font>

29
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:52,229
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chinese crazy people that did this</font>

30
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,990
port but the nice thing about it is that

31
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:59,340
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a complete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet switch a</font>

32
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:01,530
capable CPU and lots of other

33
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,560
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff and some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless LAN</font>

34
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,699
need to put on separate external

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,400
antennas and and it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much like</font>

36
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,859
open hardware in the sense that you can

37
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,160
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out exactly what is it it's built</font>

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,990
and you can create software for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:25,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> try to try to check it to that so</font>

40
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:29,070
my just a little bit about myself i mean

41
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:31,380
i've been working at a company where we

42
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:35,790
do embedded linux development for around

43
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,350
three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this is custom systems</font>

44
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,220
for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of weird products from</font>

45
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:45,120
medical devices to actually computers

46
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,720
running inside train toilets really wide

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,490
range and and to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we have to</font>

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically be able to completely</font>

49
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:56,760
customize the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux operating system and</font>

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,700
use of space utilities to work in those

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">settings before that I have been</font>

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:09,238
involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Linux for around nine years</font>

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">now I mean mainly in a interesting linux</font>

54
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,260
distribution that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a spin-off</font>

55
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,390
of the n2 where we build everything from

56
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,179
scratch also from source code directly

57
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm a maintainer in this open source</font>

58
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,610
project that I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

59
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">about and i also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a background in</font>

60
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:32,100
academia as a PhD doing wireless network

61
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:36,239
performance optimizations yeah so what's

62
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,730
this about why why why am i where am I

63
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:43,049
going with this I mean as I said

64
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,850
initially a typical household today we

65
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,830
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> see like a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

66
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,989
electronic devices I mean typically

67
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,180
those are like what i would call when

68
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,220
the lockdown devices of some kind where

69
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,680
you you buy a completely finished

70
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,350
product and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect maybe for</font>

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,060
some time to have software<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates or</font>

72
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,950
maybe a couple of new features but

73
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,190
generally you are in completely in the

74
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,780
hands of whoever did the device well it

75
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,519
also means that you typically get it at

76
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,459
a very reasonable price at least

77
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,049
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you see it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean you</font>

78
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,040
can get cheap router as you can get

79
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:19,228
cheap network-attached servers and all

80
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,200
these kinds of things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

81
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:24,450
least in my own experience I often felt

82
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,520
frustrated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the stuff that</font>

83
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,818
you can buy and

84
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,000
I been wondering if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some way</font>

85
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,680
that I could I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> change this aspect</font>

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,190
that I I actually would like to be the

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,919
one that that decides what to do with my

88
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,780
device and if I can modify especially

89
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,698
the security part of it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what annoys</font>

90
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:49,289
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and being able to restrict it and</font>

91
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:51,780
actually update a critical parts of it I

92
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,370
mean you would often see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

93
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">though you might get software updates</font>

94
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,470
for these kind of Linda devices they<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

95
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">be not really updating it in a relevant</font>

96
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,780
manner so you're still running like a

97
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,750
very old pc box or<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux kernel that is</font>

98
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,309
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> filled with flaws and even</font>

99
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:12,090
though they say that they are updating

100
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been wondering if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font>

101
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,919
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm I mean there are I</font>

102
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,690
should say of course a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

103
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,389
possibilities<font color="#CCCCCC"> of not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going into this</font>

104
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,190
completely crazy direction of building

105
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,199
the whole thing yourself I mean you have

106
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,940
lots of the linksys device shown here is

107
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,740
a perfect example of where it all

108
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,310
started with tinkering with routers and

109
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,620
the open brt project is great project I

110
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,539
mean you can run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on lots of devices</font>

111
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,180
so there's much easier ways to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

112
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:42,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this but in my case I actually want</font>

113
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:47,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be not limited by whatever choices</font>

114
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:53,039
someone else made yeah it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

115
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:55,650
same here I mean typically you you see I

116
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,860
mean I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least very very shitty</font>

117
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:00,690
software quality it's also often filled

118
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,509
with features I don't need I mean I

119
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,430
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to hook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a printer from a</font>

120
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:08,310
router but maybe someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> will but maybe</font>

121
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,770
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't and maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't want to deal</font>

122
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">with all the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is added on on</font>

123
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:18,630
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the device</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

124
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:21,000
these cases and but I generally also

125
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,620
have ways of using these devices that

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,130
the manufacturer maybe didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

127
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:31,830
so maybe you possible to change and yeah

128
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,319
I think it's appropriate to be honest

129
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,469
with stuff like this I mean that's lots

130
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,449
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason not to do this and I mean I've</font>

131
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,349
already been working on this project for

132
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,610
a while

133
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:46,110
say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you combine the free the spare</font>

134
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,260
time I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using on it maybe it's</font>

135
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,800
taking me to three weeks all in all to

136
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,599
reach a state where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still don't really</font>

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a fully functional home router but</font>

138
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,410
it's starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it's actually starting</font>

139
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,719
to be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be used and</font>

140
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:12,000
it's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work Michael you ruined it</font>

141
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:15,840
and it's sometimes at least require some

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,720
deep knowledge of linux<font color="#E5E5E5"> bedded</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux</font>

143
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,469
maybe even to get stuff working but I

144
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,420
mean there's so many helpful documents

145
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:28,140
say so much helpful advice for all

146
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,510
around the place and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it depends a</font>

147
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,450
lot on the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of project that you were</font>

148
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:38,430
going to to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in this particular</font>

149
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:40,289
case basically to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started at least</font>

150
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,480
or to give something working it wouldn't

151
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,270
really require specific low-level<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux</font>

152
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,700
knowledge to to extricate it to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

153
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:51,120
where it's a very maintainable software

154
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">vice it does require that and and of</font>

155
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,070
course now it's mainly at least you who

156
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,219
will have to do basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the work</font>

157
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,290
at least initially at some point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

158
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,810
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to take updates from</font>

159
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:06,240
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the upstream projects</font>

160
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,820
the whole point for my side is also to

161
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,630
get the software on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a board like this to</font>

162
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,909
a point where i can actually

163
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:15,240
continuously taking new linux kernel's

164
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:20,340
new boot loaders new whatever I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

165
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,470
and in the easiest way possible so<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

166
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,489
picture of the board here I don't know

167
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:30,510
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you can see if it it is a</font>

168
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,219
relatively cheap way to get the hard way

169
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:35,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a router I would say I</font>

170
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:39,479
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I bought it it was something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

171
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:43,079
350 danish crowns unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hit</font>

172
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,240
customs so it became more expensive but

173
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,150
if you can somehow manage to about that

174
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,980
it's not it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive at least not</font>

175
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,470
to compare to some of the earlier

176
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,089
projects<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have been trying to use to</font>

177
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,509
solve the similar tasks I mean

178
00:08:54,089 --> 00:09:00,660
there are various<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ports that</font>

179
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:02,579
has multiple ethernet and you can of any

180
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,490
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just throw a big normal</font>

181
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:08,069
computer edit maybe that's that's easier

182
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,220
I mean my<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier experimentation has</font>

183
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:13,259
been arrived around using openbsd and

184
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,559
because they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice firewall</font>

185
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:19,290
implementation but it it brought its own

186
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:22,529
kind of problems I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel</font>

187
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:25,529
it's that easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain it I mean</font>

188
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,839
upgrade wise you're not really sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

189
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:30,930
everything is still working every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

190
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,180
and you end up basically doing a little

191
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,739
bit of the same that I mentioned this a

192
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,019
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you've basically stopped</font>

193
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,449
updating some parts of it and to avoid

194
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,339
stuff breaking down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I really never</font>

195
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:45,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">had much success with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless LAN</font>

196
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:53,430
part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just be due to my</font>

197
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:55,620
knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a the bot is a</font>

198
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,930
little bit funny it does more i would

199
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:02,009
say then just being a router it there's

200
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:05,459
a there's a SATA port so you can plug in

201
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:07,439
a normal hard drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think it</font>

202
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,179
will boot off it but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a</font>

203
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:11,339
big deal you could easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> put most of</font>

204
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:13,920
your software on the on the set of

205
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,679
device as well and then just have the

206
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">bootloader on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> under microSD card let</font>

207
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:22,670
us in here it also has an ace Wow

208
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,450
it also has an<font color="#E5E5E5"> HDMI connector so it's a</font>

209
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:34,209
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think they a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

210
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:37,480
confused if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

211
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:39,250
medias and uh I don't know but it I mean

212
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,570
it also just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it possible to do</font>

213
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">more stuff you don't really have to use</font>

214
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,710
all these hardware features it's very

215
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you have a serial</font>

216
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:51,010
console hooked up to three pins directly

217
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,219
on the board and you just buy one of

218
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:56,500
these cheap<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-dollar ftdi cables or</font>

219
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,440
clones from from<font color="#E5E5E5"> China and then you can</font>

220
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:05,440
talk to to both the boot loader and and

221
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,690
the colonel directly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU is called</font>

222
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,950
an allwinner a20 it's one of the

223
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:14,410
trillion different I'm course you can

224
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,520
find out there it's like pretty decent i

225
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,589
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> performance-wise you have a</font>

226
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:21,069
dual core 1 gigahertz and one gigabyte

227
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:26,980
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this board it should be plenty</font>

228
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:31,990
to run a proper router with so my goal

229
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:36,880
would be to replace my cure and some

230
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:38,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">wenda based home router with this and so</font>

231
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,850
what would it need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do well it would</font>

232
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,330
have to have some wireless LAN

233
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:48,100
capability and there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> some realtek</font>

234
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:50,950
wireless LAN already on yeah and which

235
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:54,070
should be usable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would I would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

236
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">meet fight to make sense for me and all</font>

237
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,000
this work to make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of sense the</font>

238
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,920
idea would be that the software becomes

239
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,890
completely maintainable meaning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

240
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,110
am in full control of what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

241
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,920
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> dependent on some weird setup</font>

242
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:11,860
outside my house where some distribution

243
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,050
decides that this is no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed or</font>

244
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,570
so they move<font color="#CCCCCC"> remove the software or some</font>

245
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:19,449
upstream software dependency of some

246
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:22,900
kind and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not be stuck with</font>

247
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:27,580
whips proprietary software that that you

248
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:31,090
cannot update and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the only part</font>

249
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,500
here that is still stuck somehow is

250
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:37,390
probably the firmware on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wireless</font>

251
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">LAN that I bit hard to get rid of and</font>

252
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,860
then there's a design decision from my

253
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:43,870
side I actually want the<font color="#E5E5E5"> build of the</font>

254
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,150
software to have the configuration of

255
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:50,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device completely hard-coded I want</font>

256
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:53,500
to be able to always produce the working

257
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,660
software that from scratch<font color="#E5E5E5"> which means</font>

258
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if the SD card decides to die I</font>

259
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,620
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> built the software again and it's</font>

260
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,050
fully working and it's built into my

261
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,580
version control system how everything is

262
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:08,530
configured and this is actually possible

263
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:11,260
my with this oh we like project so to

264
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,120
have a somewhat working browser system

265
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:17,350
in this case I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a bootloader</font>

266
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:21,370
the guys doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips I think they</font>

267
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:23,770
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sun X I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty good at of</font>

268
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,930
streaming soft driver support and for

269
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:29,020
their chips so so you have proper

270
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,150
support in to like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you good so that's</font>

271
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:35,439
and it's a pretty much a default choice

272
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:37,720
in in the arm world it's rather

273
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,130
straightforward to work with it's pretty

274
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">much the same as building the linux</font>

275
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,600
kernel you have like a que config based

276
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,550
configuration system you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

277
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,250
how to configure it for a given bought

278
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,979
but that's typically supplied from from

279
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:52,780
from either the one creating the board

280
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,610
or directly in the u-boot source code

281
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in this case it turned out that's</font>

282
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,440
someone already on someone already did

283
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,750
all the work in the u-boot so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can use</font>

284
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,440
a but nearly you butchers<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

285
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">need some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of operating system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i I</font>

286
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,860
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a limitation of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> light</font>

287
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,140
project that it doesn't really build

288
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,690
anything else than Linux but that's also

289
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,760
the reason for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and simple</font>

290
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the flexibility in the Lee knows a the</font>

291
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,220
Linux ecosystem is completely resolved

292
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,930
around the idea that you combine<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

293
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,520
these components<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely how you want</font>

294
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,099
to it also it's also a challenge because

295
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,870
you have to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but</font>

296
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,480
it allows you to completely Taylor the

297
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,390
system to your needs so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

298
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,970
need the linux kernel some lip see some

299
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:38,650
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something to boot the system you</font>

300
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,390
could think of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as like a completely</font>

301
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,329
minimal linux distribution of some kind

302
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:46,010
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to need something to</font>

303
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:49,190
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to provide router functionality</font>

304
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,890
so at least in my case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to be able</font>

305
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:55,100
to assess<font color="#CCCCCC"> 82 it and I wanted to be able</font>

306
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:57,740
to do firewall functionality and hand

307
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:03,500
out IPS and stuff like that on on my

308
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:06,470
local network so now this may be

309
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,050
different ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can approach this and</font>

310
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:13,100
there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different levels of</font>

311
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:17,420
idealistic scenarios in how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

312
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:22,130
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have chosen to only person only</font>

313
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:26,360
try to to try to perspective it to the

314
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,920
more the the most used probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

315
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,830
people would try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to achieve the same</font>

316
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,780
thing like this I mean it's at least

317
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,600
it's something that we hear a lot in our

318
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">in our in my daily work I mean also our</font>

319
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,740
typical customers will ask well why

320
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,260
isn't it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough to just run</font>

321
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,820
ubuntu on it I mean it's nips it's

322
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">working right so we can just use that</font>

323
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's you I mean we want two runs on</font>

324
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,880
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things now that it's they have</font>

325
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,290
active maintainer of various armed ports

326
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,090
and all that stuff but there are

327
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,270
actually reasons whether it might not be

328
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:03,590
preferable at least in this case and

329
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,329
first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically on these kinds of</font>

330
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,460
thoughts unless some you want to

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:11,210
developer already decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to completely</font>

support your bought a meaning with the

333
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,410
colonel and a you boot boot load of some

334
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,760
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually works</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this board</font>

335

336
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,840
custom version at least seen from a you

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of perspective that's it's</font>

338
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,490
possible but it's a bit difficult and

339
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,860
tricky to do it in ubuntu is not really

340
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,710
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fucked in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sense that</font>

341
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,470
the use of<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this makes the</font>

342
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:38,210
serious modifications so it's not

343
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:42,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to be that you run all kinds of</font>

344
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:44,750
custom stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's also the aspect</font>

345
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,870
of it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to decide when and how</font>

346
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly to update the software this is i</font>

347
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,160
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say really hot in ubuntu you could</font>

348
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,890
probably achieve it by having your own

349
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,900
repositories<font color="#E5E5E5"> with Debian packages and</font>

350
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,529
try to basically take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font>

351
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,019
maintenance of the

352
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,970
ubuntu software stack but it's probably

353
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">also defeating completely the purpose of</font>

354
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,799
running ubuntu because then why are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

355
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,209
even I mean then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> benefiting</font>

356
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:14,668
from it anymore if you just have to do

357
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:16,799
it all yourself so I also I know by

358
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:20,760
experience that you basically you want

359
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,679
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be able to easily</font>

360
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,199
modify some parts of the upstream

361
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,480
software now it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want</font>

362
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the latest development version</font>

363
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,570
because there's some feature or that

364
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,250
some bug that was solved in there you

365
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,530
would definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

366
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,890
patch it and you definitely want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not</font>

367
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,809
be not rely on that it's the upstream

368
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,960
distribution that the dust is for you

369
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:44,280
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my case I also want to be able to</font>

370
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,440
disable everything I don't want

371
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,289
basically I want to tailor it just do

372
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,870
what it's supposed to and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

373
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:53,400
is next to impossible basically because

374
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole point of a generic</font>

375
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,900
distribution like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ubuntu is to make it</font>

376
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,850
as easy as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get something</font>

377
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,650
running and it shouldn't involve all

378
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:03,899
these kinds of decisions on what to

379
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,780
include in what should not include so

380
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:09,928
again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be able to achieve it</font>

381
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,820
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard then there's</font>

382
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:14,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the most important aspect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

383
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want to be able to always read I want</font>

384
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:20,669
to always no matter how long it from now

385
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,020
I'm going to rebuild<font color="#E5E5E5"> my SD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> card I want</font>

386
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:24,630
to be able to do that from scraps

387
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,389
without depending on something outside

388
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,000
by my own computer basically now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

389
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,470
extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard with a normal</font>

390
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution because it's again it's set</font>

391
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,399
up to be easy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up so that you</font>

392
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,110
should do as little as possible and it

393
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:40,799
means that yours end up relying on

394
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:44,158
various software and services basically

395
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,658
being provided from the distribution now

396
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,000
i put in a disclaimer here yes I'm

397
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:50,159
really biased because I work with this

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,840
stuff daily but it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that i</font>

399
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,260
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen this kind of things fail</font>

400
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,320
really hard in practice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've seen</font>

401
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,330
companies and individuals trying to do

402
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,580
stuff like this with the normal

403
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,620
distributions and really it's going to

404
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,330
it hits them some rather heart in a very

405
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,979
unfortunate period of their development

406
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:12,090
phase is typically and I i just wanted

407
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,960
to start somewhere else

408
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:18,059
so one way at least of actually

409
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,789
fulfilling the stuff that I have set up

410
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:24,090
as a requirement to do this is is this

411
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:26,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">built framework you can call it a it's</font>

412
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:28,770
called OE light it's like a rather

413
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:30,720
crappy name<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually but its depth that</font>

414
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:34,620
stems from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was created</font>

415
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">where initially it was a tried to do</font>

416
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,949
some technical improvements of the open

417
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:43,350
embedded project that turned out to

418
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,419
require everybody in the whole world to

419
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,219
change basically the recipes that build

420
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:51,270
recipes if they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take in this</font>

421
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,770
technical change and open a better party

422
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,510
people they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not interested in</font>

423
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:57,690
enforcing some kind of change<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

424
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,549
on all their<font color="#CCCCCC"> users so it ended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up as a</font>

425
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,960
stripped initially at least as a

426
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">stripped-down version of the open</font>

427
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,980
embedded with these technical

428
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,919
improvements inside of it I'll come back

429
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,620
to those technical improvements and and

430
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:14,220
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think your formal AC perspective</font>

431
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:15,959
ended up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name light OE but it's</font>

432
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,529
not really light in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense it's more</font>

433
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,200
like it says it's a version of

434
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:24,929
openembedded where you where there's a

435
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,700
more strict focus on certain aspects and

436
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:31,740
where certain features have been taking

437
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,779
away so some of the design goals of that

438
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,720
of the Holy Light project is to

439
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:38,700
basically try to minimize the number of

440
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,299
surprises you get from trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

441
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,340
everything from scratch it has to be

442
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:46,230
possible to customize every aspect of

443
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,879
your system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is simply to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

444
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,029
facilitate all the different kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

445
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,820
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

446
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:55,860
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bill frameworks this is this is</font>

447
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,899
a the number two bullet full

448
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,840
customization is also something that you

449
00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:02,520
see in in big project like<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to your</font>

450
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,470
doctor project and open abetted

451
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,139
openembedded is also still a project in

452
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:10,919
itself and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same they also have</font>

453
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:15,299
that now in contrast to York to an open

00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:18,929
embedded<font color="#CCCCCC"> go will add tries to not</font>

include to only include the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

456
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,590
that are really strictly needed and try

457
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,780
to not try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid to make it too</font>

458
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:25,889
complicated whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible because</font>

459
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,090
it's complicated enough

460
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:32,370
ready actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it's a I'll not</font>

461
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:34,740
just a goal but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like also a</font>

462
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,000
technical requirement inside the bill

463
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,410
framework that everything has to be

464
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,210
reproducible not in the TBN reproducible

465
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,420
builds since where you have like binary

466
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,160
can compare to binary addition from

467
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,660
different build host but more in the

468
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,460
sense that when you run your built<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

469
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,990
need to be pretty sure we need to be

470
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,420
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> what is what is the output</font>

471
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,090
basically so you don't risk picking up

472
00:21:54,420 --> 00:22:01,110
some weird corner case of a build system

473
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:03,689
and then including something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and an</font>

474
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,780
interesting aspect of this is that all

475
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:08,940
configuration can be baked into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

476
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,490
building process don't see you have to

477
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,490
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> runtime</font>

478
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,830
configuring your device<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can actually</font>

479
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">add all of this configure to build</font>

480
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,850
recipes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

481
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,860
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the software they are</font>

482
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:24,689
constructed in a matter in a matter such

483
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,310
that you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually configure them at</font>

484
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,470
Build time to to include all the

485
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,320
configuration needed when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system is</font>

486
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:32,700
deployed and this has the interesting

487
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,139
aspect that you actually put your

488
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,960
configuration into a version control

489
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,640
system so you you also have complete

490
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,170
control of your configuration yourself

491
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,960
and it's backed up and typical or light

492
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:49,050
built produces like a set of complete

493
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,730
file system images so it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a boot</font>

494
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:55,530
file system and then a root file system

495
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:57,720
to actually run run the device and and

496
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,520
those are typically at a ball of some

497
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,160
kind with all the needed files in it and

498
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,720
then you can rather easily create a

499
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,930
script small script or something to

500
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,120
flash those to your whatever the choice

501
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:11,730
of storage device you have I mean in the

502
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,979
cheap end of all these devices that

503
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:20,430
would be an SD card so how does that

504
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">work well from a very like high level</font>

505
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:30,480
perspective you have a set of generic

506
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:33,930
built recipes used to to to basically

507
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,510
take the software that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the whole</font>

508
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux ecosystem downloaded and configure</font>

509
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:40,860
it and

510
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:43,080
build it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and install it and these built</font>

511
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,209
recipes are split into various topic

512
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,030
repositories because you don't typically

513
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,880
need all of them all the time that's

514
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,740
like a set of that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the core set of</font>

515
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,180
recipes that are dealing with building a

516
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,960
tool chain that works for your target

517
00:23:54,180 --> 00:24:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">device and there's a base layer where</font>

518
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,780
all the normal normally normally used

519
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:06,750
software would live like in its systems

520
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,330
and call libraries of some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> lip seas</font>

521
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's</font>

522
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">various other like layers of that you</font>

523
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,940
can bring in if you need them so like

524
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:18,780
from multimedia if you want to run

525
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">graphical stuff like cute or a it could</font>

526
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,430
be that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to include Python</font>

527
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,140
on the device also<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe for example so</font>

528
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:29,130
there's like various categories and I

529
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:32,700
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> show them in a bit then besides the</font>

530
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:35,580
generic recipes there's a set of files

531
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,300
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hierarchy of configuration files</font>

532
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:42,360
basically that is configuring how this

533
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:46,409
bill should happen and if split into

534
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,540
three main categories one that deals

535
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,610
with the actual hardware that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

536
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,680
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build for so we call it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

537
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,270
machine configuration and that would

538
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,290
typically set up properties that are

539
00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:00,210
directly related to what a specific

540
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:02,490
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you need a specific kernel</font>

541
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,890
for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device if you need to tweak</font>

542
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,930
some kind of initialization on this

543
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:09,060
device and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

544
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:12,720
there's something that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really I</font>

545
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,159
dislike the naming of this but it's you

546
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,500
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it at this district</font>

547
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,990
configuration is more like whatever is

548
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:22,590
not hardware-specific but could be used

549
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:24,300
in on any device but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still for</font>

550
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,850
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still want to say where your</font>

551
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,800
inter<font color="#CCCCCC"> pserver lives stuff like that and</font>

552
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,490
then there's like like local

553
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,770
configuration stuff that is not stop

554
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:38,010
something like running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this build</font>

555
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:40,080
machine i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 cpu so i can tweak how</font>

556
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:43,410
many how many pills are due in parallel

557
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,740
that's more like a at build time

558
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:49,290
configuration then there's a tool

559
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,970
written in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python that's basically</font>

560
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming back all the way</font>

561
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">gentoo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's also have the image</font>

562
00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:00,780
deposits tool called image the command

563
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:02,520
line at least it has this heritage but

564
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,950
it's really not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same anymore but</font>

565
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a python-based tool that you</font>

566
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:10,110
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to build it will read and</font>

567
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,490
pass all these recipes and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry</font>

568
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,530
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> two different tasks involved with</font>

569
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:17,309
building the software out of that

570
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:20,970
process comes one or more images that

571
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,710
you can actually put on your device so

572
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,960
from a user perspective when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">created some of these when the recipes</font>

574
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,110
are then your configuration is there

575
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:30,600
then it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to use it at least</font>

576
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,969
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is unfortunately still some</font>

577
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,399
dependencies on tools from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host</font>

578
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,530
machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use to do the build you</font>

579
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically have to have a tool chain to</font>

580
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,418
start it all up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a to bootstrap the</font>

581
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,580
built the first thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens in in</font>

582
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:47,190
oil<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID is that you build a tool chain</font>

583
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">cross-compiler</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can target whatever</font>

584
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:56,460
device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're developing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for ya so</font>

585
00:26:51,960 --> 00:27:00,510
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine I hope you can see</font>

586
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,520
this reasonably at least what is

587
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,020
definitely in a machine configuration is

588
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,480
some kind of information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

589
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:11,010
target architecture so in this case it's

590
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,990
an arm cortex a8 that's that's the

591
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,390
general architecture of the also for the

592
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,429
old winner chips something some

593
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,789
information related to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> API that you</font>

594
00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:23,190
are using and then there's various<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

595
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,650
configuration settings here determining

596
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,200
basically how the bills should in detail

597
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:31,049
what what is what is specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

598
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:34,530
machine usually that would be at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

599
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:36,750
something like what what Colonel

600
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:39,000
configuration or divide this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

601
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,590
case we point to a specific device<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree</font>

602
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,600
it's basically informing the Linux

603
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,309
kernel what hardware we are putting on

604
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,370
that's that's how you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up stuff in</font>

605
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:50,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">the arm world and then various settings</font>

606
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,620
about memory and what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are maybe if</font>

607
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,740
you have specific there's a specific

608
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:59,939
configuration of your your network

609
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,380
devices and here's some in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

610
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,230
lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have some stuff about</font>

611
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,919
the serial console that speaks

612
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:10,530
when you boot the vote so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine</font>

613
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,049
configuration is deals only with

614
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,540
basically stuff that really is specific

615
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:17,040
to that hardware and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice thing</font>

616
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,750
about this is that and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

617
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,760
configuration for different machines you

618
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,590
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually build the whole set of the</font>

619
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,510
same software but targeted to another

620
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:28,799
set of hardware because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's described</font>

621
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:30,600
in a separate configuration then there's

622
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">the distribution configuration this is</font>

623
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,189
the high level<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff more like the deals</font>

624
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,020
with what parts of these built recipes

625
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:39,120
should be included and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> should they</font>

626
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,679
be configured that I mean you can go

627
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level of actually only</font>

628
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:47,669
including only configuring them to do

629
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:50,520
specific stuff and here for example we

630
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:52,169
in this distribution file that I

631
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,290
configuration file<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made for this board</font>

632
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:56,730
I'm basically including all of PC<font color="#E5E5E5"> books</font>

633
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,649
because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to deal with that</font>

634
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now so I'm sharing give me</font>

635
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,150
everything from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this box and then</font>

636
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:06,120
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> various settings for for how</font>

637
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:09,900
that should be done this is like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

638
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,790
root password is baked in yeah even<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

639
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,660
should remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change that at some</font>

640
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:17,340
point probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hostname and various</font>

641
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,660
settings it could be many different

642
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,370
things you're depending on the software

643
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:24,720
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you end up including on your system</font>

644
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:27,570
then there's the the built the the bill

645
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">target that you could say the top-level</font>

646
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,129
configuration is like a configuration

647
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:34,949
file where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say I have this board</font>

648
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:37,559
it's the machine is a banana pie<font color="#E5E5E5"> R</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

649
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:40,020
and at the distribution I want to run on

650
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,990
that so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hardware specific</font>

651
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:46,620
configuration this is this configuration

652
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:50,280
file then no light also<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to</font>

653
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:54,000
build a software<font color="#E5E5E5"> development kit that is</font>

654
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:56,668
in this case cross to chain that is

655
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,040
completely set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run on your host</font>

656
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:04,350
machine the one that you specify here in

657
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:06,899
this case a 32 bit linux run the binary

658
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">will run on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but it will target so</font>

659
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,280
if you produce anything with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

660
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,049
chain it will target the device and if

661
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,820
you use our light to generate such an

662
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:16,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">SDK it will have exact matching</font>

663
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,139
libraries and everything

664
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,670
what that matches what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on the</font>

665
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:24,850
root<font color="#E5E5E5"> filesystem here so you can use it</font>

666
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do local development of new features</font>

667
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:31,689
and then some settings basically for how

668
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,760
to do the build in this case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

669
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,010
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs do have a course do I have</font>

670
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,250
to actually do the build and you can

671
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:42,010
also have like temporary or rights of

672
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:48,280
configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters in this file as</font>

673
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:53,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">well and everything may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

674
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:56,770
built is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like focused around what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

675
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:58,810
called recipes so a recipe is something

676
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,780
that the oil I too will read and then it

677
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:05,080
will do a set of steps to execute what

678
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:07,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">is being told in these recipes and here</font>

679
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have shown the colonel recipe the</font>

router board not some meta data

682
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,010
variables just to say what it's about

683
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:22,750
and where where it's located and I have

684
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:25,420
a the various nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the light</font>

687
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,660
specific devices or to exhibit certain

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,979
behavior depending on what they are

00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,680
being killed for in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

690
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:41,140
chosen to say that this recipe will

691
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,750
never be<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered by the tool if it's</font>

692
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">not this machine because it's pretty</font>

693
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,340
hard coded the recipe to actually only

694
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:52,149
work with this machine then it points to

695
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:54,429
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> github repository where where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

696

kernel source for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> board lives and</font>

697
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:01,780
what configuration the colonel should be

698
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,250
built with that's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and many</font>

699
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,690
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recipes will look like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

700
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,450
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple not much not much</font>

701
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:13,000
coding is involved in actually creating

702
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:15,130
recipes and in the in the nice version

703
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,410
of it you shouldn't really need to do a

704
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,720
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that yourself at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

705
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,180
them for the software that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is already</font>

706
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:28,390
where a recipe<font color="#E5E5E5"> has already been created</font>

707
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:30,490
for you so thus configuration and built

708
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:33,040
recipes and a tool

709
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:35,260
and so how do you then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually build it</font>

710
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,250
well it has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been decided a</font>

711
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,929
long time ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it should be</font>

712
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">relatively straightforward to figure out</font>

713
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:41,950
what to<font color="#CCCCCC"> build and for this reason as a</font>

714
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:43,990
general principle in the oil light

715
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">project that you create a top-level</font>

716
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:47,500
recipe called machine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font>

717
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,780
dealing with pulling in all the

718
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,390
necessary dependencies for building

719
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you want for your device so in</font>

720
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,990
the in the nice setting you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

721
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of minimal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> built host configuration</font>

722
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:02,230
this is described in the project I used

723
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:05,380
Arkham for it because it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

724
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:07,780
to spawn<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth in a virtualized machine</font>

725
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,360
with the right tools in it and then you

726
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,760
just run a we<font color="#CCCCCC"> baked machine and it will</font>

727
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,590
chew on this for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> while depending a lot</font>

728
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,690
on what software you include stuff like

729
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,730
building cute or browsers or something

730
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,200
like that that takes a while but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

731
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,090
case where I actually have the

732
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,850
bootloader kernel and various

733
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:28,059
dependencies needed to bring me up to to

734
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:30,070
a command prompt for this device it

735
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:33,340
takes around 24 minutes all in all to

736
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:35,379
build the toolchain<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross-compile tool</font>

737
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,449
chain and build all the stuff needed to

738
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a bootable system here</font>

739
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:46,330
this is on a modern tested machine but

740
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:48,760
still it's really not<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad so each of</font>

741
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:52,780
these recipes that are being built<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

742
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:55,450
are built in a separate this is this

743
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,520
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the technical</font>

744
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,020
advantages of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> light project</font>

745
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,889
compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alternatives</font>

746
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:05,050
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jojo Inoue light each single recipe</font>

747
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:07,660
that's being built is being built in a

748
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:10,210
separate see root meaning that you

749
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,280
create a directory layout somewhere on

750
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:16,570
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> file system in some kind of</font>

751
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,220
temporary directory layout where all the

752
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:20,320
dependencies needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually build</font>

753
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:23,259
this recipe they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> state in there and</font>

754
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,909
then that minimizes very much the risk

755
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,040
that you're picking up some weird stuff

756
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,119
that will influence your build so you

757
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,310
are very sure that now you're actually

758
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:31,720
building exactly what you want and that

759
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:36,219
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> including stuff that you</font>

760
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:39,158
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want and whenever these different</font>

761
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:41,259
recipes have been built the binary

762
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,060
output of these ends up somewhere that

763
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,290
it can be repackaged into a file system

764
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:50,469
the tarball of some kind

765
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:53,320
and for each of the recipes the the

766
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:55,120
general case and this is this is

767
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,470
designed around that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

768
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,509
just how you normally would build a

769
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:01,029
software project in at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least this is</font>

770
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:04,300
this this this set of steps they pretty

771
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:06,220
much they can pretty much be converted

772
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,570
to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kind of software that</font>

773
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can find around the whole open</font>

774
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:12,730
source to ecosystem they are quite

775
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,029
centered around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outer tools build</font>

776
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:17,110
system because that is where you that is

777
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,450
where you typically have the nicest

778
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,370
implementation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> for cross compiling</font>

779
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,250
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it can be it can work for</font>

780
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:26,319
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything so you fit some</font>

781
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:29,350
source code typically that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a</font>

782
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,000
description of where to fix it and check

783
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:33,279
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the right source code</font>

784
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,860
that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting and you unpack it</font>

785
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,560
you may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some patches at least</font>

786
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:40,240
that's what happens sometimes due to

787
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,610
cross compiling<font color="#E5E5E5"> are various other issues</font>

788
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,680
you configure the software with the

789
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:47,590
features that you want and then it

790
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:51,580
builds the software<font color="#E5E5E5"> and installs it into</font>

791
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:53,770
a directory that would so wear the

792
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,990
layout inside that directory would

793
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,090
resemble if you just install it on any

794
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,100
kind of Linux machine and then in a

795
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:02,050
light<font color="#CCCCCC"> its repackaged into different it's</font>

796
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,210
split into different component packages

797
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:07,270
so you have documentation in a separate

798
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:08,860
package you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the utilities are</font>

799
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,450
typically split out in two separate

800
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,660
packages so you can include whatever you

801
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,430
want so binaries you may be so only one

802
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:19,359
some of them libraries are split up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

803
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:23,799
and then all these packages are put

804
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,510
together I copied back into like a

805
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:31,690
shared place where this file system

806
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:33,640
tarballs can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be generated from so you</font>

807
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,560
see I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have time this it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

808
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,450
big deal just wanted to just briefly

809
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,890
show you what where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> project lives</font>

810
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:45,250
it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not anything big and shiny</font>

811
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:47,819
but let's take a look why is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

812
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,820
like this

813
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:58,489
yeah so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> homepage is just github</font>

814
00:36:56,539 --> 00:37:03,169
paces in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a link to the github</font>

815
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:07,999
project here it's currently not that

816
00:37:03,169 --> 00:37:10,038
great room for improvement but and we're

817
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:12,618
working actively on improving this all

818
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,809
the time and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically the</font>

819
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:18,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">place that you expect new users to hit</font>

820
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:21,890
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to very soon be some</font>

821
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:25,549
getting started guides yeah and the

822
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:27,769
github<font color="#CCCCCC"> project contains</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these different</font>

823
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:30,109
layers of guilt recipes that I talked

824
00:37:27,769 --> 00:37:33,769
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have call recipe space</font>

825
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:35,900
there's the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page there's some</font>

826
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:39,109
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a continuous integration</font>

827
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:41,119
on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things so when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people push new</font>

828
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:44,150
features<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the project we're basically</font>

829
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build it for a reasonable set</font>

830
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:50,239
of different target devices and taking

831
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:54,499
that it still works there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or cute</font>

832
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:56,599
Python some mono stuff freescale stuff

833
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:59,089
yeah lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things some</font>

834
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:02,749
documentation repositories and various

835
00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:05,299
other things and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly showing</font>

836
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:12,198
one of these see if we can increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

837
00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:14,509
a bit yeah so a typical repository with

838
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,759
recipes would look have a layout similar

839
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:18,469
to this you have recipes you have some

840
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:22,099
configuration that might be specific to

841
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:25,969
this this category<font color="#CCCCCC"> of recipes and then</font>

842
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:28,549
you have generic<font color="#CCCCCC"> say there's a level</font>

843
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:30,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">above recipes where multiple recipes</font>

844
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:31,999
could use the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of functionality</font>

845
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,189
so in order to not duplicate this all

846
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:36,890
around you have classes<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is also</font>

847
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:38,868
found in our various other source based

848
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,519
distribution this concept so you

849
00:38:38,869 --> 00:38:42,349
basically have something to deal with

850
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,640
outer tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> build system for example so</font>

851
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:46,789
you don't have to do it all over in the

852
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,129
recipes and then in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> recipe a</font>

853
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:50,659
directory you have all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

854
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:53,959
you can actually include on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your device</font>

855
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:56,869
like here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blues boost sim plus</font>

856
00:38:53,959 --> 00:39:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">plus stuff and dhcp blah blah there's a</font>

857
00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:04,440
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of various recipes here</font>

858
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,700
you will not find that much like that

859
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,740
the various<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you will not</font>

860
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,779
really find in a way light for instance

861
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,729
full desktop environment like KDE

862
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,010
doesn't make much sense on embedded

863
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:16,410
devices typically so nobody did that yet

864
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,660
but the basic stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stuff that you</font>

865
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:20,730
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a working command line</font>

866
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,200
based system is definitely here and you

867
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,150
will also be able to do some graphical

868
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,939
stuff with the cute layer and whatever

869
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,560
you you can think of and let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just take</font>

870
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:34,170
a brief look here's some Libra ssl

871
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:36,150
recipe for instance so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

872
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,460
longer a little bit more complicated

873
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:40,170
recipe but that's because it deals with

874
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,650
actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to split out the</font>

875
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:45,480
different parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> libra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl into</font>

876
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,890
whatever you might want to include and

877
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,330
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also something here that deals</font>

878
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:51,600
with if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> building it for windows</font>

879
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:58,049
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like that so just to briefly</font>

880
00:39:51,600 --> 00:40:01,020
show you what's up there um yeah then

881
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:03,450
there's a connected to that's like the

882
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,340
easiest way in a github project setting

883
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,379
to actually be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk easily to</font>

884
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,030
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> other's through some of these other</font>

885
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:11,640
third-party services we use this called

886
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:16,470
kita that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am it's basically just web</font>

887
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:18,029
based chat<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd used to use IRC but at</font>

888
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:19,560
least for certain people is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like very</font>

889
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,240
inconvenient<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to connect to</font>

890
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is much easier with the web pacing</font>

891
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,689
and it has you can browse back to

892
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,009
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> people set and various</font>

893
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,830
different channels and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these nice</font>

894
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:34,200
properties so you can hop in and discuss

895
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:40,890
this with us if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to that was not</font>

896
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:44,910
it so back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the router I have now a a</font>

897
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:46,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">top level you can call it we call it a</font>

898
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,589
manifest repository because it's like a

899
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,509
repository that configures the Holy

900
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:54,540
Light projects in a specific way that

901
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:57,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">matches some kind of of a useful some</font>

902
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,859
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in product and so in my case i</font>

903
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,619
have i've created a project on github

904
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:03,779
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> eli banana</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pie because it's the</font>

905
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:06,570
board and there's a repository you can

906
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,640
clone it a git clone it and it contains

907
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:13,109
all that is needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this built</font>

908
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,520
actually run and and produce a bootable

909
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:16,319
system that

910
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,350
that is just put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SD card with a</font>

911
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,770
small script and currently it's using

912
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:27,600
completely vanilla up Absalom you would

913
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:29,790
from now ridden<font color="#CCCCCC"> 215 i'm pretty sure I</font>

914
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,799
update I think I that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a wrong</font>

915
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,140
here it's more recent that I have some

916
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,180
2016 version of you who'd running on it

917
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,460
already and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much on purpose</font>

918
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:42,299
I've I started with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bootloader</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

919
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:44,820
wanted basically I want to use upstream

920
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,280
pure upstream software such that I'm not

921
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:50,130
hooked into some weird brands where I

922
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to up maintain the Linux curtain</font>

923
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:54,240
branch myself or something weird like

924
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:55,980
that and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking like it's it's</font>

925
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,740
it's completely impossible in this case

926
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:02,100
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started out with the colonel from the</font>

927
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:04,319
banana pie people that's some really

928
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:06,060
crappy<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecoute dump that it just put on</font>

929
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,400
github at some point and you can't even

930
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,590
really use it to compare directly to the

931
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,710
mainline kernel because they decided in

932
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:15,570
some infinite wisdom to at both the

933
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:18,090
u-boot and the kernel code into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

934
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,640
git repository and then completely drop

935
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:22,500
all history from that so you can't

936
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,310
really see how it was done you could

937
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:27,570
copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into a little skit repository</font>

938
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,480
and didn't see what they actually did

939
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:32,160
but what is what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the case is</font>

940
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,570
that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> allwinner guys the guys doing</font>

941
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip they are very active in</font>

942
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:39,090
approving their stuff too suse linux so

943
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,590
a next step is to actually try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font>

944
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,900
in a van illegally nocturnal<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

945
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:44,400
board it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very interesting</font>

946
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,710
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless LAN especially but i</font>

947
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,420
think it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> i might cure research</font>

948
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,810
shows me that this should be doable if

949
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:57,390
not i might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resort to some kind</font>

950
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:59,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of USB based wilds LAN then i need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

951
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,960
actually make it a router with some of

952
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,460
the user space utilities this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty</font>

953
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,260
straightforward because i know we have

954
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,840
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that Miss needed to run in</font>

955
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:09,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">annex pond and dhcp server and whatever</font>

956
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:13,350
in allied already so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

957
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:16,440
just in writing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want dhcp in my</font>

958
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:19,589
file system and then i<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

959
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,480
possible to fork the runtime

960
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:24,270
configuration easily such that you could

961
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,910
as another user maybe you could clone my

962
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:28,349
repository then you could add a few

963
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:30,118
configuration settings and then

964
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:33,660
you have your own router with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

965
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:35,400
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that at that point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think then it</font>

966
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,319
could be opened up for other people to

967
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,029
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> around without I would advertise it</font>

968
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:42,630
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banana pie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Vicky and stuff like</font>

969
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:45,329
that sometime in the far future<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

970
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:48,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like to add some web UI maybe</font>

971
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:50,700
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I currently actually really like the</font>

972
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:53,489
idea that i do not create runtime

973
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,868
configuration on the device but I bake

974
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:58,680
it into the bills because then I can

975
00:43:54,869 --> 00:44:00,509
always recreate it but it's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

976
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a trade-off it's quite annoying that</font>

977
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:06,749
you have to do a built to open up a TCP

978
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:10,289
port I don't know maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> stretching</font>

979
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:13,288
it and that's where this right now a sum

980
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:17,160
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of my friends did a 3d print from</font>

981
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:19,559
some schematics already provided by some

982
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,598
of the community guys around the project

983
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,630
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a like a complete casing here</font>

984
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,400
for that fits the board spacing for the

985
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:29,009
all the ports and stuff it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

986
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit rough but it actually i have i have</font>

987
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:39,779
had it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there it works so some nice</font>

988
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:42,690
possibilities oops<font color="#CCCCCC"> m yeah that's that's</font>

989
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:45,450
it I mean I'm trying to basically

990
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:48,089
illustrate that this somewhat idealistic

991
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:52,049
way of thinking of your own devices is

992
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:54,719
probably possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a significant</font>

993
00:44:52,049 --> 00:44:58,529
amount of work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean for most of</font>

994
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:59,910
our guys it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably fun anyway so I'm</font>

995
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:02,430
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go a little bit back to the Y</font>

996
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,618
here because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is always</font>

997
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:07,828
useful to talk about I mean that

998
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,690
trade-off right so I'm trading off the

999
00:45:07,829 --> 00:45:12,150
easy way of just using a vendor router

1000
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:15,390
and not caring too much about it with

1001
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,460
like probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a significant amount of</font>

1002
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:23,969
work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least I choose when to do it</font>

1003
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:26,579
and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it worth it well i don't think i</font>

1004
00:45:23,969 --> 00:45:28,650
have used more time on this that it then

1005
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:31,170
yeah i think it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth it</font>

1006
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,460
because now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm reaching a point where i</font>

1007
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:36,539
can do exactly what I want with my

1008
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,670
router and I have two huge advantage

1009
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:41,549
that i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in any way dependent on</font>

1010
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,240
anything external<font color="#E5E5E5"> west so i can rebuild</font>

1011
00:45:41,549 --> 00:45:47,730
it from scratch

1012
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:50,069
at whatever time I choose and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1013
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,150
huge benefits of hooking it into a bill

1014
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,480
framework that is a little bit

1015
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:57,180
complicated is actually that at some

1016
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,310
given at some time in the future I might

1017
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:02,069
find a more interesting on board or

1018
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,930
whatever or the weird architecture I

1019
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:06,390
could think of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be a better</font>

1020
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:07,919
fit for a router or my work better let's

1021
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,470
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wireless LAN is going to</font>

1022
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,270
give me a headache<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end up</font>

1023
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,830
finding a separate piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hardened I</font>

1024
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,680
would be really annoying if I have to

1025
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:18,480
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> from scratch again but since I</font>

1026
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,819
actually used this tool or we light for

1027
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,580
this and I described<font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine as a</font>

1028
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,170
separate thing here all the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

1029
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,119
did to the recipes it's just completely

1030
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:30,060
portable into another machine so if I

1031
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">just create just create another machine</font>

1032
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:35,250
configuration for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate pot I can</font>

1033
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,170
use the same software so i don't have to

1034
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,460
redo the whole thing if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i decide to</font>

1035
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,010
change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> halfway this is one of the</font>

1036
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:47,100
really cool side effects of of having it

1037
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:49,560
hooked up like this yeah maybe I'm not

1038
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:52,230
ever going to do anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird with it</font>

1039
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:57,330
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I ran out of time but I can</font>

1040
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:59,970
do that it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's it</font>

1041
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:09,020
from my side<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope you enjoyed it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1042
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:09,020
if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions no</font>

1043
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:13,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright then</font>
