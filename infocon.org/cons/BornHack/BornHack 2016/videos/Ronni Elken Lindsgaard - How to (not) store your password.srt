00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now we'll listen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ronnie</font>

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:17,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">elkin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> linnco talking about how not to</font>

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:20,670
store your passwords<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi this</font>

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,210
presentation is gonna be about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new</font>

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,160
method method in order to manage your

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,670
passwords so hopefully when you all

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,800
leave here you will go out and think

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:37,860
about how not to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and how I think</font>

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,949
you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do it is by having your</font>

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,969
password stored in some sort of database

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,530
either online or offline so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

12
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,190
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the program first</font>

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,350
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present to you why having</font>

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:55,230
your password stored anywhere is a

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,969
liability and then I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna present to</font>

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,910
your method how you can generate

17
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,739
passwords that are secure on the fly<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

18
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,099
you never have to stall them ever again

19
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,929
all you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is remember a few</font>

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,789
credentials that you type in and then

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:16,049
you generate the password then thirdly

22
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm gonna present to you my own work and</font>

23
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,830
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> what other people have done in this</font>

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,740
field it's a very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small field and</font>

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,929
it doesn't have for some odd<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason it</font>

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:30,479
doesn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much there there's not</font>

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,420
many people who actually work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this</font>

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,850
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only paper I've got on it is</font>

29
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:41,759
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 12 years old that you as you</font>

30
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,740
will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there are i differentiate</font>

31
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
between two types of password managers

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,250
there's online password managers and

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,390
there's offline password managers so of

34
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,219
course they both give you a solution to

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,860
a problem that's why they even<font color="#E5E5E5"> used in</font>

36
00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:00,929
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place online password managers</font>

37
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,969
specifically have the strength that

38
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,119
they're portable you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can access them</font>

39
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,679
anywhere and within an organization it's

40
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,470
very easy to share passwords for

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,940
instance LastPass makes you share

42
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:18,070
passwords with other people

43
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:20,650
but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> again they're not on your</font>

44
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:24,489
machine you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually command where</font>

45
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:27,370
they are there's a liability in that if

46
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:31,480
last passes database is compromised

47
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:35,290
which it has been proven to to be more

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,750
or less at least open or susceptible to

49
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:43,000
attacks where you can get other people's

50
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:46,030
bolts maybe they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there they're</font>

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,190
still encrypted but maybe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

52
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the encryption will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> broken and then</font>

53
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:54,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">people will be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access your</font>

54
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:57,100
passwords from from then then there's a

55
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,549
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> offline password managers</font>

56
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:03,940
there they have mitigated the problem

57
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:05,170
but we got to accessing a database they

58
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:09,670
have to actually infect your computer

59
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:18,488
and be able to to get your get your

60
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:20,200
database out of that and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

61
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,940
can also easily generate strong

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,160
passwords for instance we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> keepass</font>

63
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,880
which is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most commonly known</font>

64
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think at least in my world but then</font>

65
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,000
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's still a problem with them</font>

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,079
because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one key to the kingdom</font>

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,770
that if you manage to somehow fish or

68
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:42,340
otherwise get the get the password out

69
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:45,820
of if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the password out</font>

70
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:49,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of one of you I can more or less get</font>

71
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:54,250
your entire database and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even</font>

72
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:58,840
necessary some of the time we saw for a

73
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:02,080
little while ago the key base the key

74
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,410
base bug where a xml file was

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,630
accidentally saved to this kit

76
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:11,200
unencrypted with the the entire database

77
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,989
store so there's also problems there

78
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,730
it's a liability that to have your

79
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:19,418
passwords floating around in some sort

80
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:25,060
of file so let's try to make things

81
00:04:19,418 --> 00:04:26,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">better these are the areas that I focus</font>

82
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,920
on when I

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:32,830
want to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> password manager first of</font>

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">all it should be easy to create secure</font>

85
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:41,260
passwords or at least manage them both

86
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:45,700
last pass and one pass and keep ass etc

87
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:48,940
has an ability where you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

88
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,469
very high entropy password very easily

89
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,580
you just click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a button and then it</font>

90
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,640
takes something from your random file or

91
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">something it should be configurable you</font>

92
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,610
should be able to specify how many

93
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">characters would I like which types of</font>

94
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">characters should I use because not</font>

95
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,100
because it should be that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way but</font>

96
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,830
because usually you use passwords on web

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:19,300
pages and web pages suck with with

98
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:22,030
regard to password with regard to

99
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,880
password rules so there are characters

100
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:28,210
you cannot use there are there's a limit

101
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,250
to which which types of characters you

102
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,080
should have as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum there's even</font>

103
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:36,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">some places where you can have a maximum</font>

104
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,669
size on your password<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth</font>

105
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,440
thirdly it should be easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use and</font>

106
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:44,470
manage because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use passwords every</font>

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,900
day the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do when i open my</font>

108
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:49,600
computer is used to passwords one for my

109
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,330
encrypted hard disk and one for actually

110
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,000
logging in and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just starting the</font>

111
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:58,390
day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then everything else is always</font>

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,940
also password protected so it should be

113
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:04,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">easy to to to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get your passwords out of</font>

114
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:07,719
it and then it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be shareable</font>

115
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,090
because you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to share</font>

116
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,780
passwords within an organization you

117
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:19,239
want to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if you're a if you</font>

118
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:20,950
have a service running outside that more

119
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,930
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization for instance</font>

120
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,430
the the sysadmin department or

121
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,730
development department should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

122
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:32,680
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> then then you need to share the</font>

123
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:34,810
pants<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoops and then fifthly it should</font>

124
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,370
not be stored there should be no trace

125
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,350
of your passwords when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

126
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,830
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use them</font>

127
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:47,020
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how we actually do this</font>

128
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:48,849
so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> first talk about what is the</font>

129
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:54,010
secure passwords there are many many

130
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:55,960
opinions on what compromises a secure

131
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,920
password it would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a great</font>

132
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:03,520
place to to have the xkcd drawing here

133
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,180
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rather give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you some a couple of</font>

134
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,370
references<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can read</font>

135
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,870
because they were all quite interesting

136
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:18,100
actually so arm high entropy more or

137
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">less everyone are agree on that high</font>

138
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,110
entropy is a must you need to have a

139
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,729
rather long password you should

140
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:30,490
preferably use both small and large

141
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:36,190
letters you should use<font color="#CCCCCC"> number special</font>

142
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:38,080
characters etc so one of the then it's

143
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a new thing but one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

144
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:46,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are advised and what the xkcd comic</font>

145
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:48,850
that I talked about earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentions is</font>

146
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,650
having some sort of pass pass phrase

147
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:55,210
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> type in because it's a very</font>

148
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:57,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">very long it's a very very long sentence</font>

149
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,190
and password so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a high entropy</font>

150
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,800
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense that it's very long so the</font>

151
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,719
search space in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order to to to break it</font>

152
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,790
becomes very long but then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

153
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,020
have the problem that it's not

154
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:14,500
necessarily it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily that</font>

155
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:17,049
good because push nah he argues for

156
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,820
instance that the the password breakers

157
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:20,950
acted on to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> method so they have</font>

158
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,719
methods in order to to provide

159
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:27,190
dictionary attacks that actually

160
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:30,760
combines these very very yeah very

161
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:34,450
cleverly in order to break passwords so

162
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Bruce Schneier has proposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

163
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:41,169
scheme he calls it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce Schneier</font>

164
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:44,740
scheme<font color="#CCCCCC"> is from 2008 actually where you</font>

165
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:48,670
instead take<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like a sentence</font>

166
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,589
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you make it into something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

167
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,819
you understand yourself for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

168
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:56,260
this is a sin

169
00:08:51,820 --> 00:09:00,610
since that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> too long to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember um</font>

170
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:04,000
and yeah that might also be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea</font>

171
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:07,510
but then again it's still not random

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,760
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still it's still still susceptible</font>

173
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:14,350
to two attacks if you if if somebody

174
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,960
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hack you can know enough about</font>

175
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,440
you then they can maybe figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out your</font>

176
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:24,310
schemes on how you do it and it's it's

177
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,710
better than password with a wither with

178
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:30,790
an @ sign but it's still not very good

179
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:34,930
and well it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good and it's still</font>

180
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:38,890
usable so but yeah and then try hunt he

181
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:42,489
he argues that a password should be too

182
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:45,250
complex to remember he is very fond of

183
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,440
one password and I understand why and

184
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,780
I'm really into the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

185
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,790
as Troy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Honda's but I want to add that</font>

186
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,130
it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not only be too complex to</font>

187
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:55,630
remember it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be something</font>

188
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,250
that you don't even know<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

189
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,920
don't even need to know your password

190
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:03,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to generate</font>

191
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,640
your password so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how we do</font>

192
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:12,670
it I suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone knows md5sum</font>

193
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:15,250
that's is actually how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used used to</font>

194
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,410
make user login systems back in the days

195
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:23,020
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was young and played around with</font>

196
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:25,689
PHP in my my sequel I've come a far way

197
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:29,410
since then so what we have here is just

198
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">a hashed value of Natural Born hackers</font>

199
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">the string natural-born haggar hope and</font>

200
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,930
we're going to use this hash this hash

201
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,980
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a hash function</font>

202
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:45,250
to generate a password so how we do it

203
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,580
is that we have the hash as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

204
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">before I've turned it down a bit because</font>

205
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,930
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really necessary to have it</font>

206
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,730
longer than this in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a</font>

207
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,040
point and then I have some sort of

208
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,650
alphabet this is a predefined alphabet

209
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,079
consisting of a series of characters

210
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:04,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use for my password so</font>

211
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:09,140
the longer the alphabet is

212
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:11,780
the more characters the the generated

213
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:15,980
password will be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consist of but</font>

214
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:19,459
here I've just used used 16 characters

215
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:23,990
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplicity purposes so what I do is</font>

216
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:26,690
that I take each of each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

217
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:29,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">characters and use it as a number and in</font>

218
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:33,710
this in this alphabet and generate and

219
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:37,400
generate a new string from that so the

220
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:40,820
first one is a it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we put in</font>

221
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:44,660
a the second one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for then we find the</font>

222
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:48,170
fourth letter or the first fourth

223
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:52,579
element and so forth until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

224
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,709
generated a<font color="#E5E5E5"> random string or it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

225
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,010
random string<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's deterministically</font>

226
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:01,100
created by the hash and a hash has the

227
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,480
great ability that it's not referral so

228
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,790
you can't see what it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

229
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,910
made up you can just see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

230
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:16,819
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that looks or should look</font>

231
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:23,839
quite random then next we don't just

232
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:26,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">want with your yeah moreover we also</font>

233
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,670
like to have some sort of we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

234
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:31,880
to reuse our passwords all the time so

235
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:34,310
this creates this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a simple method in</font>

236
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,439
order to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password but you would</font>

237
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,449
also like to have different passwords

238
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:41,690
for different sites for instance so what

239
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:43,340
we do is we add some sort of context in

240
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,880
this instance this is a very simplified

241
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:49,130
instance but I then we just append the

242
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,370
context to the password so for instance

243
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:56,210
if i choose to context born<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at DK</font>

244
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,010
i have an account at at born hack and i

245
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:05,540
use the password natural-born<font color="#CCCCCC"> haggar</font>

246
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:10,430
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i get out from the system I can get</font>

247
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:13,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">out a very very long pass phrase or a</font>

248
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,140
password and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use instead I use it</font>

249
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,840
on github and still keep my

250
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,610
password natural-born hacker I get a

251
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:24,210
whole other string which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

252
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:28,140
other password so and you can see this

253
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:32,220
consists of small letters large letters

254
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:35,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's characters and its basic numbers</font>

255
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:40,860
and special characters and there's and

256
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:44,069
it's 32 characters wide as well so this

257
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:49,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would say has a very high entropy</font>

258
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:54,540
actually what I've done also because

259
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:56,460
there is when choosing letters out of

260
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,099
the alphabet there is a possible

261
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:05,100
selection bias I actually sometimes skip

262
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:07,650
a one of the one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the characters in</font>

263
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual created hash such that</font>

264
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:13,260
because the index is too high then I

265
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,319
just gave it so there's a chance that

266
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,840
you can even from this even though you

267
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,330
know how to reverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> this function you</font>

268
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:25,050
don't even get the correct hash when

269
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:29,580
you're done so so that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

270
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:34,500
sue force so furthermore i also add a

271
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:37,740
session key the session key i<font color="#E5E5E5"> use for</font>

272
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hash function seed so because when</font>

273
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,940
we have a hash function you want to see

274
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:46,710
did probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it can also be used for</font>

275
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:49,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">other purposes for instance you can if I</font>

276
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:53,490
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save some configuration I might</font>

277
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:55,620
have an alphabet for website that

278
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,390
doesn't allow special characters then I

279
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,360
remove those characters from the

280
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,010
alphabet and then I save that I've

281
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,730
removed these characters so I don't need

282
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:10,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">to so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to type or remember</font>

283
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:12,240
that once again and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> session key</font>

284
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,490
could be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unlock this this</font>

285
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,820
information so it's not just lying

286
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:19,530
around somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's of course some</font>

287
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,990
liability because the new stores

288
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:25,110
something again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it's a</font>

289
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,690
liability but it's better to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have</font>

290
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,760
then the attacker would be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a</font>

291
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,370
recipe on how to

292
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,740
configure it but it still wouldn't have

293
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the actual keys that that he needs</font>

294
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:43,980
furthermore it also mitigated shoulder

295
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:46,920
surfing where somebody physically can

296
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,280
view what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you type in on your in on your</font>

297
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:54,959
machine when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in that in</font>

298
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:57,990
that sense it can't can figure out what

299
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,870
your password is so it's not a foolproof

300
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,880
way but it's it's definitely better than

301
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,760
nothing nothing so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are various</font>

302
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementations of this method on the</font>

303
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,960
first one that's been proposed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

304
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:16,470

<font color="#E5E5E5">Sanford paper from 2004 it presents a</font>

310

method where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose a hash but it</font>

311
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:39,210
does not provide a it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have the</font>

also it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> old and it's very much it</font>

00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:54,480
browser<font color="#CCCCCC"> plug-ins and and there's been a</font>

316
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:57,840
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening since 2004 so what what</font>

317
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,510
they did back then was they just access

318
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,180
to an event manager and like rap

319
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:05,940
whenever somebody typed in something

320
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,220
into that<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page but then the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page</font>

321
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,530
if it knew what you were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

322
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,920
still be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your url your</font>

323
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:17,310
actual password key so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've figured out</font>

324
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">a way to circumvent this and and escape</font>

325
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,770
the time entirely I have a proof of

326
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:26,849
concept of that but that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a topic for</font>

327
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:29,220
another another talk because I've not

328
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:33,090
gotten that<font color="#E5E5E5"> far with with the rest of</font>

329
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process so and finally it does not</font>

330
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,669
use special characters it's only small

331
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:42,480
letters large letters and numbers but I

332
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,220
guess it's still fine it's still better

333
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,700
than nothing

334
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:53,539
then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I based my</font>

335
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:55,909
stuff on it should it's an old student

336
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:59,030
friend of mine you had bank who made

337
00:17:55,909 --> 00:18:01,460
this in 2009 he made a proof of concept

338
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:04,340
and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual implementation but it</font>

339
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,960
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get stable it only consisted of</font>

340
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,480
small letters and numbers and it used

341
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past function so and the way it</font>

342
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,159
did it it generated a 16 character

343
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,010
password with small letters and numbers

344
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:17,750
it's still better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than nothing and still</font>

345
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,480
better than what most of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

346
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:25,370
doing since it's 16 characters but it

347
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:29,570
had some other problems and and it used

348
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:33,500
the same method for bed manipulation as

349
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:36,470
the PWD hash so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really usable</font>

350
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,630
and it's it's possible to attack it so

351
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:41,150
and that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why I</font>

352
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,679
actually started implementing it myself

353
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:50,299
and extending this furthermore there's a

354
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,970
newer version that uses almost the same

355
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:55,908
solution that I do it's called one shall

356
00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:01,250
pass it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Maxwell Krone who</font>

357
00:18:55,909 --> 00:19:04,820
also who is fairly known around<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

358
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:07,100
kept quite up to date a month or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two ago</font>

359
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,110
when I started preparing for this talk I

360
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:14,330
looked at his website and found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

361
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:16,969
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> had updated with a new system and how</font>

362
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:20,870
to to generate the passwords that looks

363
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:24,080
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much like mine he also uses PP kdf</font>

364
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:26,330
in order to to as a hash function so

365
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,840
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> project but he</font>

366
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:34,189
he only focuses on providing a simple

367
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,530
standalone<font color="#CCCCCC"> web page where my my final</font>

368
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,870
purpose is to generate a proud browser

369
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">plugin because you you can mitigate some</font>

370
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:44,059
attacks by implementing in in the

371
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:49,100
browser directly and you can also use

372
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:51,799
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> command line clients etc so let me</font>

373
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduce to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you our new phrase improved</font>

374
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:56,389
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

375
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have released the first alpha version</font>

376
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,090
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be at least one more I</font>

377
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:06,530
found some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's on the to-do</font>

378
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:08,540
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use PP k DF 2 for hashing I use</font>

379
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:14,420
the web crypto API to do that because

380
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:16,490
while working on this the the w3c was so

381
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:20,090
kind to actually make a standard for it

382
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:23,300
and get it into the various browsers it

383
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,370
provides a way to configure the

384
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:29,960
characters that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use you can even</font>

385
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:35,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">default with the the four basic</font>

386
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:39,050
character types<font color="#CCCCCC"> minuscule letters large</font>

387
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:42,860
letters numbers and special characters

388
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:45,470
but if you know how to do it the the

389
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,419
library supports that you add other

390
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:51,050
stuff it could be Unicode letters or

391
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,550
something I'd suppose if if the if the

392
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:56,419
website where you want to enter it

393
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:58,669
actually allows it so it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> provides a</font>

394
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,010
way to control which kinds of characters

395
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,590
are there or how many because there are

396
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:06,890
places where you need to have a minimum

397
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:10,100
of two small letters and two large

398
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,990
letters or something so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can say the</font>

399
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,209
password that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that is generated</font>

400
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,000
should contain at least this and it will

401
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:20,990
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> order to to give you</font>

402
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,770
exactly a<font color="#CCCCCC"> a password that is valid for</font>

403
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:28,310
your purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can also control</font>

404
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:30,440
the size of the password you cannot say

405
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,750
I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is specifically</font>

406
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,800
this side<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of how the algorithm</font>

407
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:39,980
works but you can say I want a password

408
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,080
that is approximately 32 characters long

409
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,950
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want one that is approximately 42</font>

410
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,139
characters long etc and it also provides

411
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:51,410
means in order to reuse your credentials

412
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,440
so whenever you have to their their

413
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:57,170
website so there are mechanisms where

414
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,080
you're forced to to change your

415
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,930
passwords every one month three month or

416
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,090
whatever so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the same</font>

417
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,040
passwords that you use every day and all

418
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,010
you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remem</font>

419
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,889
a little number which is a version and

420
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:16,280
what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it just takes up how</font>

421
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:19,520
many rounds the hash function<font color="#CCCCCC"> will do</font>

422
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,810
and then it will create a new password

423
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:27,350
every time instead so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user</font>

424
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:31,520
interface it's I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's fairly</font>

425
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,929
simple but for someone who's who who

426
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,100
comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outside it might not be</font>

427
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:39,800
that very simple so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

428
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,760
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a website where you can where</font>

429
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:46,700
you can go in rd on<font color="#E5E5E5"> RD phrase there's a</font>

430
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,220
link later in the in the slides so you

431
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:54,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">just enter a seed this is the seat that</font>

432
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you use for all your purposes so it</font>

433
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,430
might be correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> horse battery stable</font>

434
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,730
it's a fine passphrase it's not probably

435
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a good idea since this is this is</font>

436
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:07,460
the example let's have been put on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

437
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:10,370
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if I were someone who wanted</font>

438
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,780
to to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font>

439
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:15,439
that's probably the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

440
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:18,920
try then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have some password which</font>

441
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:23,150
you type in every time that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

442
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:26,120
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something the web the web page right</font>

443
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:29,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">now reset the password field every time</font>

444
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:33,500
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go away from the tap such that</font>

445
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:37,310
nobody can just come along<font color="#CCCCCC"> and grab your</font>

446
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:40,220
passwords if you as long as you tap out

447
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:42,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you use some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of uri or</font>

448
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:45,710
some some place that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want for</font>

449
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:51,140
instance this is the domain of of where

450
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:53,270
I've grabbed it from so and then when

451
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,010
you type in here stuff will start to

452
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,200
happen here which is the hash which is

453
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,300
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the resulting password where</font>

454
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,090
then can get a very long string and it's

455
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,850
also been cut down so it's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

456
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,610
long but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not viewable but when you</font>

457
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,360
activate this field then it will select

458
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:14,750
everything such that people around you

459
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,740
cannot see the password actually there's

460
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:22,260
a legacy mode button which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using</font>

461
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,670
the original on d phrase implementation

462
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:29,820
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you had asked me to</font>

463
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:35,850
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's a very good idea and</font>

464
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:39,840
so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> until this one reaches 1.00</font>

465
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:41,428
actually i'll be keeping this this is

466
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> version button it you can just</font>

467
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:46,830
increment this for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have</font>

468
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:49,439
to have to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> your password every 30</font>

469
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,480
days you can just type in the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

470
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,750
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the month that we're in right</font>

471
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:58,890
now and we can specify some sort of size

472
00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:00,240
furthermore there's a checkbox that can

473
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,710
be unchecked if you want to use

474
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">something else than the default default</font>

475
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:07,679
suggest having<font color="#CCCCCC"> 11 character of each</font>

476
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,020
character Simon you can specify the

477
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,900
alphabet<font color="#E5E5E5"> the minimum occurrence and the</font>

478
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:16,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">maximum occurs if you want one and</font>

479
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:21,870
there's of course more down here I just

480
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:24,000
cut it out so of course there's a lot of

481
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:27,330
active attacks thinking that can be made

482
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,679
on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> system there's a key logging</font>

483
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:34,050
there's other sorts of attacks that that

484
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,020
is still vulnerable to but every<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

485
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:41,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">password manager is vulnerable to the</font>

486
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:43,440
same same attacked the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

487
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,720
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no storage there's no</font>

488
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,950
database that can be grabbed and

489
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:53,160
possibly broken at some point and I

490
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:56,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's checking off a mark that's</font>

491
00:25:53,160 --> 00:26:00,330
a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing at least so yeah I believe</font>

492
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:03,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that this is a way to generate</font>

493
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:06,300
secure passwords you cannot find out the

494
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:10,650
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> password by if you if you</font>

495
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,780
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage to to figure out if for</font>

496
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,360
LinkedIn for example which has just<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

497
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:19,980
or the hack with several years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

498
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">just saw it in the news again because</font>

499
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:26,220
they finally admitted that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they lost the</font>

500
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:28,020
passwords then even though that they're

501
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,240
compromising they can view the actual

502
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,280
password they cannot view my password

503
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,660
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just view a password</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've</font>

504
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:40,120
change the long time since then so and

505
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,670
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though I use maybe use the same</font>

506
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,800
password different places or I use the

507
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,900
same credentials to generate the

508
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,790
password it's never the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> password</font>

509
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,430
because they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never be able to get</font>

510
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:54,340
into to my gmail account my github

511
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:57,580
account or anywhere else it's

512
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,320
configurable I can when Apple sells me

513
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,409
that I cannot have this character in my

514
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,290
in my password then I can just remove it

515
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:07,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the alphabet when I generated so</font>

516
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:10,720
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember to</font>

517
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:13,420
remove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> special character every time</font>

518
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,090
that's an annoyance right now but at

519
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,830
some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll figure out a way to or</font>

520
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:22,270
find the time to actually implement some

521
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:24,280
sort of local storage or similar I find

522
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:29,260
it easy to use I use it every day I dog

523
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:31,690
food dog feeder and yeah and I actually

524
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:34,150
find it so easy so even though I use

525
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">LastPass i generate the passwords in</font>

526
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,770
here store them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and last pass because</font>

527
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:42,129
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know how to actually find them</font>

528
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:44,080
it's shareable you can find some

529
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:48,070
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy one two three four for</font>

530
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,649
instance as you saw that's what people

531
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:53,530
who need to share passwords uses anyway

532
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:56,350
so now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have a way to generate</font>

533
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,360
it very very securely and there's no

534
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,909
storage it doesn't get stored anyway it

535
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:04,629
might be stored in memory in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser</font>

536
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:09,460
and and that kind of thing but but right

537
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:13,660
now that's pretty far that's not really

538
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:16,240
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think right now so yeah if</font>

539
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:22,000
you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to read more there's a</font>

540
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:29,950
website I might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it might not be</font>

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:32,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> s thing might not be be active right</font>

542
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:35,170
now because I'm a really bad at system

543
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:38,410
administration and I need to renew my

544
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,700
lat synch rip the certificate there's a

545
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,940
kid have account where you can see all

546
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,250
the

547
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,920
the way you can see the source there's

548
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,980
also several side projects and stuff on

549
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,050
there you're very welcome to look at my

550
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,470
code because I need somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to review</font>

551
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:56,750
this at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has just been me</font>

552
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:59,510
hanging on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it basically so there might</font>

553
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:00,980
be things and either way it would be

554
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,160
really nice to discuss what I've

555
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,470
actually done and then I have also

556
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">provided a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roadmap on my personal blog</font>

557
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,850
where you can read something about

558
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:15,410
what's what's actually to come and this

559
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:50,540
what what am i planning on doing and yes

560
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:53,570
that's the end any questions yes I would

561
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:55,460
advise you to this is a standalone

562
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,040
application so I would advise you to

563
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:03,260
download the source code and run this on

564
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:05,030
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> localhost it's a JavaScript</font>

565
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:12,800
application everything is in JavaScript

566
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:14,750
everything happens at your browser

567
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,450
there's no communication no storage or

568
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:24,770
anything on a web server to static web

569
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:28,160
page yeah to a browser plugin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a</font>

570
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:30,740
proof of code with the ideas but i don't

571
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:34,460
have the manpower<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the plugin i</font>

572
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:37,850
have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ideas I had no especially</font>

573
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,040
what I need to do but I I just haven't

574
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:42,050
had the time yet I've been focusing on

575
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,659
getting the library done so that it's

576
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:47,659
very easy to to create a node.js

577
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:50,300
application for client-side or four for

578
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,700
anything else because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's really</font>

579
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,020
alpha omega<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think and then until then</font>

580
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,580
i just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the proof of</font>

581
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,850
up and it's good enough for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

582
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,129
on it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while on this I</font>

583
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:03,500
get some funding and and some spare time

584
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,560
to actually do it unless other people

585
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:10,010
will help me I'll I'd be happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to advise</font>

586
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:24,169
people on how to start doing this and

587
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:26,300
discuss with people yes yes i have i

588
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:30,290
have thought for instance you could you

589
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:35,990
could have their civic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ii which allows</font>

590
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:39,020
you to to enter a fixed ring each time

591
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:43,610
so that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very good place</font>

592
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:45,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to locate your to locate your your</font>

593
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:48,280
session key because then you don't even

594
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:48,280
know it yourself

595
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:53,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah the porn hack password what are you</font>

596
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:58,070
asking is to porn hack password stored

597
00:32:53,240 --> 00:33:24,710
in clear text yes you you don't know

598
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:27,110
yeah and yeah yeah that's true but but

599
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:40,990
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your personal preference and</font>

600
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:53,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">godspeed with that yeah</font>

601
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:56,260
but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is you can still use that</font>

602
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,030
you that that's the entire idea that you

603
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:02,350
take something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can remember</font>

604
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:03,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">very easily so and you say you use the</font>

605
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,770
name last name of your daughter or

606
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">something and then you type that in as</font>

607
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,719
your password and then you generate

608
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:13,450
something which is which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high</font>

609
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,908
entropy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead so you can</font>

610
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:18,399
keep on using the same thing so you have

611
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:21,340
one password that is for bulk sites you

612
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,469
just put it through a grinder basically

613
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,270
you just put it through this operation

614
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:28,629
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you get something very secure</font>

615
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:30,280
so so so you still have even though you

616
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:38,770
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about it you still</font>

617
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:40,659
have a strong password who you can trust

618
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:43,899
that's that's exactly the point you

619
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:46,510
cannot even trust you cannot even trust

620
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:49,480
websites you cannot trust them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

621
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:54,159
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> password secure you cannot trust</font>

622
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:58,960
trust them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it to keep it hashed</font>

623
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:01,090
or anything you saw the d8 over a leak

624
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,330
and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's why you</font>

625
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:06,790
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though you know your</font>

626
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:08,710
password you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have inside a specific</font>

627
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,109
password than the one you actually enter

628
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:13,470
into the system that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you submit to the</font>

629
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,470
system

630
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:54,010
then you then but yes but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

631
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:55,930
that but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also fine but it's not</font>

632
00:35:54,010 --> 00:36:19,560
