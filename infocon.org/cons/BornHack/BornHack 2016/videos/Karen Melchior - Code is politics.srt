00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,730
who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how code and</font>

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:13,110
politics in turn thank you very much yes

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,420
the previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk was on how ended up</font>

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,400
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how tech is</font>

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,310
democracy and democracy is determined by

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,830
tech so this is a actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a talk on how</font>

7
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,500
code and politics and tech and politics

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,669
interact and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> welcome to tweet</font>

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,050
along the way in two thousand this is

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,250
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overview of the speech as</font>

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,750
well in two thousand a guy that I feel

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,239
should actually have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

less Lawrence Lessig predicted that the

15
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,649
code of cyberspace would change the

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,349
cyberspace that we had at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time from</font>

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,440
a place that protects anonymity and free

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,780
speech and individual control to a place

19

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes anonymity harder speechless</font>

25
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,680
the first of January two thousand and

26
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,390
since then we have had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 911 and the war</font>

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,060
on terror and things have only gotten

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,280
worse since then but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's quite</font>

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,060
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how these thoughts</font>

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,460
were already out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in two thousand</font>

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:38,340
and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like nothing really has</font>

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:41,158
changed one of the points is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> code</font>

33
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,060
regulates our world when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the politicians</font>

34
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,250
don't it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only a question of having</font>

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,619
a law and putting that down but the

would it implements values it in the way

embedding into it then we will then we

44
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,970
will be replicating the values that

45
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:21,829

actually have some extra external

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,130
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encode into the algorithms</font>

responsibility and an environmental

at the if we look at the advertisement

that's being done online I'm quite sure

that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been come across</font>

114
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,830
on earth do they think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am looking</font>

wrong they have as even if they are a

121

lot better than they used to be and

122
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,729
Google and others are making a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">money on targeting advertising to us</font>

124
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:09,080
it's we have all experienced that they

125
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:11,719
get it wrong but what do we then do when

126
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,650
we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same kind of code and</font>

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:18,530
the same faults in the code and analysis

128
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:21,679
and the data sets to predict who goes to

129

jail<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who is who gets arrested where</font>

these kind of predictive policing is not

better it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot better than the</font>

code that's being used for the

<font color="#E5E5E5">could get the computer to figure it out</font>

143
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">for them so that they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

144
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:04,460
aware of the policy consequences and the

145
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:07,190
prejudice that they have and also not

146
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,919
have to be putting the money into having

147
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,540
more people on the streets to actually

148
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,370
think about it say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get</font>

149
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,680
the computer to think about it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

150
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,720
then everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be right because</font>

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,570
the computer is always right it's its

152
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,140
technical it's neutral so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore of</font>

153
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:26,000
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we trust it but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we if we go</font>

154
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,030
back to thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advertisement</font>

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,620
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't get it right and then</font>

156
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,659
think about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that we actually</font>

157
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">have more control over what the</font>

158
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,700
advertisers are allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with our</font>

159
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,789
data and to us as consumers then we have

160
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:44,150
control over the code and the tech that

161
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:47,210
our government agencies are using and we

162
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:49,669
have less insight in the in what the

163
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,669
government agencies are using then we do

164
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:57,410
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big corporations even though we</font>

165
00:07:52,670 --> 00:08:00,860
feel that that is too little tech used

166
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:03,470
to be its own little isolated sector

167
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,990
where we could say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we regulate we</font>

168
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:07,910
perhaps we don't care so much about how

169
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,370
our code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written because it</font>

170
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:13,070
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that many consequences but</font>

171
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:16,340
now we have what everybody loves to talk

172
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it sort of the stable of BuzzFeed</font>

173
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:22,729
and bullshit bingo it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet of</font>

174
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:26,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are having everything online</font>

175
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:28,850
and you were having the weaknesses of

176
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,770
the code then being embedded in our

177
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,350
everyday lives and therefore we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

178
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,569
think even more about the moral

179
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,330
responsibilities of the tech that we're

180
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,310
producing and the true social

181
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:45,230
environmental costs of our technologies

182
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:47,119
and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to produce better code for</font>

183
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,280
our technology we need to actually go

184
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,800
back to the time when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were just</font>

185
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting it out there and trying to see</font>

186
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,270
if it would work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if it</font>

187
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:58,069
then we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and fix it and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

188
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:00,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have internal checks and audits</font>

189
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,680
before we go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it out there</font>

190
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,720
and it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about opening the code</font>

191
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,310
up and allowing people to see what's

192
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,130
written there and if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and need</font>

193
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,890
or if it's a big mess which I believe a

194
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:16,310
lot of at least I've been told that a

195
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,689
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> code is and it's also about the</font>

196
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,000
thinking and the thought process that

197
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:25,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes in to the tech and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the systems that</font>

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,410
we have and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>

199
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">please don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hesitate or if I'm saying</font>

200
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that's completely stupid don't</font>

201
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,080
hesitate to to stop me along the way so

202
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:40,880
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the the web that we have these</font>

203
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:44,750
days and sometimes sometimes we forget

204
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the web that we see is tailored to</font>

205
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,550
the choices that we've made and the

206
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,819
choices that others have made based on

207
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:57,410
the way that we the way that we act

208
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,600
online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've perhaps forgotten what</font>

209
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:03,410
it was like to be online just six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

210
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,930
ago but if you as if you are put into

211
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:08,959
jail and removed from the online<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

212
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,579
for about six years then you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

213
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,550
bit of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> shock when you come out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

214
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,680
instead of me trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:19,010
this I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to try and play your</font>

line this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the story of the man who</font>

popular blog co-editor myself and

228
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,160
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my serious efforts to promote</font>

229

Tehran has changed a lot during this

time many old houses are replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

and female stuff this was all a huge

243
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,779
surprise to me the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> shocking thing</font>

244
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,209
for me was how the internet had changed

00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had heard about social networks</font>

important and I knew but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now everybody</font>

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,870
used them what I didn't know was that

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,540
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just killed blogging as I</font>

249
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:24,560
knew it but also they had stolen most of

250
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:26,629
our readers writing and publishing in

251
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,779
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not much different from</font>

252
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:32,449
writing in a blog but<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting your posts</font>

00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">read or at least viewed by them have</font>

254
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:41,000
become a big challenge

255
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">I started my blog a new one in Persian</font>

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,410
about books<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ideas and i know that i</font>

257
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,390

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,420
shared it on Facebook and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and reflect and I used social networks</font>

262
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,209
to share my thoughts gradually I

263
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,970
realized that blogs are practically dead

264
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:10,880
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that was not the</font>

265
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,400
social networks per se it was their

266
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,470
treatment of hyperlinks and the

267
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,500
philosophy behind their algorithms of

268
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:22,190
representation or what is now called the

269
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,430
string Facebook's newsfeed is a string

270
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,580
the idea is that not everyone's posts

271
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,949
are interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you so Facebook's</font>

272
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,980
algorithms pick the ones that are more

<font color="#E5E5E5">recent and they have already received</font>

274
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,690
some likes and there are about topics

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:44,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you've already shown an interest in</font>

importance with newness and popularity

278

this is exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the real world</font>

where used and fame or better to say

00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:01,970
young celebrities have dominated our

430
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">this this valve this valley of</font>

431
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,680
open-mindedness where you have either

432
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,900
you get shown the stuff that gets lots

433
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,850
of like it's the people that agree with

434
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,700
you or it's the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

435
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,709
definitely don't agree with so if for me

436
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,120
example if Martin Henrickson had from

437
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,490
dense fog<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has said something</font>

438
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">outrageous then a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that</font>

439
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:12,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I surround myself with online would then</font>

440
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:14,550
say oh have you seen this and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

441
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,470
terrible or<font color="#CCCCCC"> in like day poles and the</font>

442
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,180
blog right balance<font color="#E5E5E5"> care this is</font>

443
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,670
outrageous how can they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say these things</font>

444
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so you have the two sides you have</font>

445
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:24,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with isn't</font>

446
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,910
this fantastic what senior Stamper just

447
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,950
said and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really made a great</font>

448
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:31,320
point or<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what Martin Henrickson</font>

449
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,000
said that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with but you</font>

450
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,620
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the meeting of</font>

451
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,030
conversations with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that you don't</font>

452
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,290
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a hundred percent and you</font>

453
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,690
don't disagree with one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred percent</font>

454
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:44,010
but you might actually find a compromise

455
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,950
and you might actually learn something

456
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,560
from each other and because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

457
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:53,700
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> media platforms that we use to</font>

458
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:56,520
broadcast our thoughts online the more

459
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:00,090
sensational we write stuff the more

460
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,610
pointed the more outrageous sensational

461
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:07,860
it is the more likes and reach will get

462
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:10,740
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have a circle where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

463
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,870
prompted into writing stuff that the

464
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,090
platforms like and that will be shared

465
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:19,889
because that's the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can get</font>

466
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:21,810
our voice heard and as a politician you

467
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:25,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymous you actually</font>

468
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:27,389
want people to hear what you say and if

469
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:30,689
you want if the only way of getting

470
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:33,960
heard is by being sensational and

471
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,390
simplified then that's what the

472
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,280
politicians will do because that's what

473
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">gets their voice out there and that's</font>

474
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,660
what makes people know what their name

475
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,430
is and be able to split that cross on

476
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,550
the voting ballot next to it

477
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really believe that that has led</font>

478
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,110
to a large amount of polarization and

479
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,540
politics because we see other things

480
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:59,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we hate or people that we really</font>

481
00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:01,570
love so wouldn't it be much better if

482
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:05,200
we're just only read newspapers rather

483
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:08,620
than be online and use the social media

484
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem is unless</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a paper</font>

485
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:14,830
newspaper<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we see the newspapers</font>

486
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,960
through their<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites and they are</font>

487
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">determined by the same way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

488
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithms as the social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> media platforms</font>

489
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,639
because most of the information most of

490
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,920
the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through to them</font>

491
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,920
newspapers they get it through the

492
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,560
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media so not even going on to</font>

493
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:39,850
traditional media will actually save us

494
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:42,370
and I have I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of the</font>

495
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,520
reasons why we see a politician such as

496
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:48,100
Trump and flourishing and being a

497
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,950
presidential candidate in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is</font>

498
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:53,020
because the journalists can sit and see

499
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,670
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people read their article about</font>

500
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,160
something outrageous that Trump said

501
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:59,140
yesterday and see that 500,000 read that

502
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,930
yesterday but they're balanced view

503
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,920
point about why Ted Cruz views are

504
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:08,380
radical radical Christianity they only

505
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,600
got like twenty thousand so they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

506
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">they'll be victims to the same</font>

507
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,070
mechanisms as politicians on social

508
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,990
media are of trying to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

509
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,929
sensational that will get them noticed

510
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,610
and they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be encouraged both by</font>

511
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,590
their sort of ego of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanting people to</font>

512
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:25,840
read them but also by their editors that

513
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">want more clicks so that they can get to</font>

514
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,990
sell more ads and earn more money so

515
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,580
what how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make sure that</font>

516
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,520
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the facts out there and that's</font>

517
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,470
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really big dip problem</font>

518
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,800
because who gives a fuck about facts

519
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,860
what you want is reach you have a

520
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:47,680
publisher like in cordova is actually

521
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,600
getting public funding in Denmark who is

522
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,220
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on facebook that's the one</font>

523
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">that gets the reach and they don't</font>

524
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,370
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> care that much about facts or</font>

525
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:58,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">violence so how how can we how can we</font>

526
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">change this in the future</font>

527
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:07,780
how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make make this a better place</font>

528
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:11,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a lot of us had hope that the</font>

529
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,870
internet will well save democracy will

530
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:18,100
change things will break<font color="#CCCCCC"> down barriers</font>

531
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:21,370
do away with the gatekeepers but the the

532
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:24,219
tech that we have the algorithms behind

533
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:27,189
the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media platforms have not been</font>

534
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,080
putting focus on quality it's been

535
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,240
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus on how many people have</font>

536
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,820
seen it how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> clicks does it get not</font>

537
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:36,490
if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed their mind or if they</font>

538
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">are able to actually change politics so</font>

539
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:42,010
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is can we actually change</font>

540
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,050
this can we make different platforms can

541
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">we make incentives for people to engage</font>

542
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:49,600
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other rather than talking at</font>

543
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,280
each other can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we somehow reward getting</font>

544
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to change their minds rather than</font>

545
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,000
punishing it because as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now</font>

546
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,190
somebody will come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

547
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,770
screenshot saying but you now have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

548
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,530
different opinion today<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what you</font>

549
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:06,010
had three<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago or two weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so</font>

550
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:08,410
therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism where it</font>

551
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:12,730
gets you to form an opinion that's

552
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:14,410
simplistic radical and then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

553
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,270
allowed to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> it afterwards and</font>

554
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:20,170
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good for reaching</font>

555
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:23,080
political solutions that help us all in

556
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,300
2011 there was the Egyptian<font color="#CCCCCC"> revolution</font>

557
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,280
as part of the Arab revolutions that

558
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,010
swept across North Africa<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Middle</font>

559
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:35,260
East and this guy was working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for google</font>

560
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:37,660
and Dubai and he he was hopeful in 2011

561
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:42,129
and he was part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook page</font>

562
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:46,780
that created the movement that brought

563
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:50,470
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mubarak and created the mass</font>

564
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:52,720
demonstrations on so he asked where he

565
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,540
said in 2011 if you want to liberate

566
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,460
society all you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the internet</font>

567
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:03,430
then 2013 came you'd had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

568
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:07,210
democratic elections in Egypt you'd had

569
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:09,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">President Morsi who was elected from the</font>

570
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,070
for the Muslim Brotherhood the first

571
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:17,110
democratically elected

572
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:20,230
president in Egypt in decades and then

573
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:23,830
you had the military going in and

574
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:26,740
removing him and you had people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

575
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,409
streets again and next<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture is a bit</font>

00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:32,950
graphic and people died people were

00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:36,220
killed by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the military and you now</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the military back in power and you</font>

579
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:42,130
don't have democracy in Egypt anymore we

580
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,560
had popular uprising helped<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the tools</font>

581
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:46,930
of the internet but the tools of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet don't help us create</font>

583
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:54,340
traditional political organizations

584
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:58,360
there is a great talk online about from

585
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:01,750
as technology socialists called Zeynep

586
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,909
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> explains how you don't just need</font>

the tech you also need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical</font>

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:10,720
meetings and a lot of the a lot of the

needed that we no longer need<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

force them to reach compromises and what

00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:28,149
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant is now saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if we want</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to liberate society we first need to</font>

00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:33,400
liberate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet we need to go back</font>

597
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,740
to or we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create an Internet</font>

598
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,050
where we have dialogue and conversation

599
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:40,050
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just talking at each other</font>

600
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:57,950
questions comments whatever did<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say</font>

601
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:57,949
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

602
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:36,000
and first of all making<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aware of</font>

603
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:39,420
the fact of what's going on and I also

604
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,480
greatly believe that we need we need to

605
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,100
politically legislate against the

606
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,400
monopolies that are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> created online</font>

607
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:49,800
and Facebook is actively trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

608
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,780
the only place you go online because

609
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,780
that's the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they can control all</font>

610
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:57,030
of what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and seeing and so</font>

611
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:59,639
we need to have some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of legislation</font>

612
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:03,600
that stops this<font color="#E5E5E5"> movement towards mobile</font>

613
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:06,990
and monopolies and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to go</font>

614
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being on the real open web and</font>

615
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:12,390
actually writing blogs taking the

616
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:15,720
information outside of the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media</font>

617
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,880
and the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it's addictively</font>

618
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,760
easy to just post something on Facebook

619
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,340
and follow the rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've</font>

620
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,710
written and I think that we should all

621
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,740
try and we should all have our own

622
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:31,020
websites we should all have places where

623
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have control over the content because</font>

624
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,020
what we post on social media is not ours

625
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,210
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that they then own and</font>

626
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,610
can do with what they like just like

627
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,860
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you buy music on iTunes you don't</font>

628
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:45,540
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> own the music you just own the</font>

629
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,409
right to listen to it until they decide

630
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:52,830
otherwise so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get people d</font>

631
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:56,010
addicted from the social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

632
00:31:52,830 --> 00:32:00,300
control that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have this mob</font>

633
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:03,540
mentality and then also try and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

634
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:07,110
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we can use other forms why did he</font>

635
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,850
try to he set up a platform promoting

636
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:12,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">more discussion that was then bought by</font>

637
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:14,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">quora where you can post questions and</font>

638
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,010
get replies and have a more balanced

639
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:22,550
kind of discussion and perhaps try and

640
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:22,550
and use more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these so it's not easy</font>

641
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,520
so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that that massage you</font>

642
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,930
are placing the stuff on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and</font>

643
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,090
their website is so crappy you can't

644
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:26,280
actually find anything and you're forced

645
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pay for it I think and I think that</font>

646
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:32,850
public service media are really

647
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:35,429
important because that's some of them

648
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,379
you control the politically and you have

649
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,950
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's national and it's not</font>

650
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">just diversified and fractioned as sort</font>

651
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,620
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> private and unregulated media are but</font>

652
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,500
I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to place we need to be</font>

653
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:51,270
more aware of the fact that Facebook

654
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:54,780
isn't neutral and it is in the internet

655
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:59,010
and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that the public</font>

656
00:33:54,780 --> 00:34:02,670
media and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also municipalities and our</font>

657
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:05,820
politicians and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgetting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all that they</font>

658
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:08,040
also break away from the sort of walled

659
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:12,630
gardens of social media<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go out into</font>

660
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public web because so many people</font>

661
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:20,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">have things that only go on on facebook</font>

662
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:22,080
and that it's that's the only way we're

663
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,929
that's the only place that is published

664
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,879
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is that it's it's really</font>

665
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:29,760
really difficult to get people away from

666
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">it also because they they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

667
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,610
understand how things work if it's not

668
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:39,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook and it's a really great</font>

669
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:41,760
political and educational task of trying

670
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:50,658
to get people to understand what they're

671
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:50,659
doing and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access things yeah yep</font>

672
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:39,630
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how you do it i think if</font>

673
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:44,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">you if you filled in to it that you get</font>

674
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:48,780
shown what has the most likes or the

675
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,670
most comments first then then you will

676
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">just replicate what happens on facebook</font>

677
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:59,550
but if you if you can somehow figure out

678
00:35:53,910 --> 00:36:01,319
a way of of getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to get some</font>

679
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:05,849
more healthy information rather than

680
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:08,520
junk food information then that might

681
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:11,099
that might work but the problem is just

682
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">like junk food is addictive junk food</font>

683
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:16,619
information that pleases you immediately

684
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,319
is also addictive you like being

685
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:22,349
confirmed you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> having people you</font>

686
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:27,329
agree with and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of outrage is also</font>

687
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:34,230
really powerful so it's it's difficult

688
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:37,710
to you need to be really difficult to

689
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:40,800
not just find the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy calories</font>

690
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:42,630
and appeal of the way that social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media</font>

691
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,099
work at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that facebook</font>

692
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:49,680
works and use that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the open web</font>

693
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:51,030
more appealing because then you will

694
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">just have the problem in a different</font>

695
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sphere there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question right in front</font>

696
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you as well</font>

697
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:12,299
no I I see a point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

698
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:15,210
if we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> politics that's dominated by</font>

699
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,420
the way that social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media works where</font>

700
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:21,930
you have because you can have a website

701
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:24,630
that will get more people viewing it

702
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,640
because you have more people online and

703
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,940
you could have a specialized website on

704
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,310
the clan system in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Somalia and you would</font>

705
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">have had two people in Denmark who would</font>

now people in small ear and kenya and

708
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,089
London would have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that website</font>

709
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,040
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have a real factual</font>

interesting discussion about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna that's not going to</font>

712
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:56,280
change who decides in the country that

<font color="#E5E5E5">you live in what decides who who gets</font>

714
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,369
elected is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that they can</font>

715
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:04,379
mobilize and if you're just writing for

716
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:07,200
the few you're not going to mobilize<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

717
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,440
masses and get them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go down and vote</font>

718
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,450
and and therefore you will have you will

719
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,050
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this polarized situation where you</font>

720
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,730
have one part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the country not</font>

721
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,470
understanding how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other part of the</font>

722
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:23,160
country could vote for those idiots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

723
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:25,140
the other part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the country thinking</font>

724
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">over that's perfectly reasonable why did</font>

725
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:29,700
all of those idiots vote for the other

726
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,890
idiots and none of them saw it coming

727
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,020
and you had it after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the elections last</font>

728
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,210
year's like oh how to Danish People's

729
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:38,580
Party in Denmark become so big we didn't

730
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,619
see that no because you only see what

731
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:43,259
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your friends like and that goes</font>

732
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:44,970
for journalists as well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside our</font>

733
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:47,310
little bubbles and therefore we've

734
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:51,109
stopped being able to understand what's

735
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:51,109
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our society</font>

736
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:37,098
I see some trends in trying to deal with

737
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">the monopolies and also try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and ensure</font>

738
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:45,800
data portability moving from from one

739
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:48,829
platforms in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next and but getting</font>

740
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:51,800
getting them to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up their code I I</font>

741
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:54,260
think we need a lot more people who know

742
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it to get active</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in politics and</font>

743
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,300
not just believe that politicians ideas

744
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,339
because otherwise it will just be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

745
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:04,579
idiot idiots who gets it aside and

746
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:07,820
therefore you don't see they don't see

747
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:11,300
the problems that are I deciding what

748
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:14,480
happens and it's it's also difficult

749
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,970
because you you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to find a way</font>

750
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">of going into the business model of a</font>

751
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:23,419
company and saying okay you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to open</font>

752
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:25,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">this up to others but when you have when</font>

753
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:30,020
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that is dominating</font>

754
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:32,299
our society as much as as Facebook and

755
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,369
Google and you need to do something

756
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:39,470
about it and you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that</font>

757
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:42,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you that you still have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind</font>

758
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,149
of you need to reintroduce some kind of

759
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:46,430
gatekeeper that's not just a public

760
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:50,720
company you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some kind of</font>

761
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:54,649
some kind of control over it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

762
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,990
can that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see what is before you</font>

763
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,609
could go down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can buy the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Social</font>

764
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">Democratic newspaper or you could buy</font>

765
00:41:58,609 --> 00:42:04,339
the conservative one and you would know

766
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:06,680
how the paper was edited and what kind

767
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:08,599
of viewpoints were behind it but it's

768
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,910
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult for you to understand</font>

769
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:13,579
what the views are and what the

770
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,990
rationale is between the face for the

771
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook stream and the edits of that</font>

772
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,509
that you see on your on your phone

773
00:42:23,369 --> 00:42:30,930
so it's I didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any easy</font>

774
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:33,660
answers to all of your questions but I

775
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,700
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also shows how challenging</font>

776
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,730
and difficult it is because it's not

777
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,700
about there are no easy solutions it's

778
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:43,470
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about okay we we turn this</font>

779
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,499
switch a little or we change this a

780
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:50,399
little it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about changing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

781
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:53,730
tech by itself it's also about changing

782
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way that people use information and</font>

783
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:59,759
how they act it's about psychology

784
00:42:55,859 --> 00:43:03,569
rather than just technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we need</font>

785
00:42:59,759 --> 00:43:05,099
to we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the way that the</font>

786
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:07,710
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we live and the way that we</font>

787
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:09,480
interact and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and change the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

788
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,069
for the better for the better try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

789
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">change the tech for the better and try</font>

790
00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:16,499
and try and change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the politics for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

791
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:20,039
better and it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of small steps but</font>

792
00:43:16,499 --> 00:43:22,859
hopefully by being aware of<font color="#CCCCCC"> there being</font>

793
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:27,740
a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the first step to finding</font>

794
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:27,740
a solution thank you very much
