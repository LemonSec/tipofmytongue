started that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been almost since</font>

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,720
then have been running uncensored dns

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,930
servers privately because because<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,729
censorship just doesn't make sense for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,960
lot of reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will that i would</font>

freebsd and you've probably all made me

20
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:30,540
during the week so okay uncensored<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font>

21
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,729
or since you free tennis in danish is

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,689
pretty simple it's just a couple of

23
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:40,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">names of us that respond to questions</font>

24
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:45,298
about IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all other tienes</font>

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,310
information we have a whole range of

26
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,259
different content that is censored on

27
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,960
the official<font color="#E5E5E5"> I speed DNS service in</font>

28
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">Denmark and these the service that I</font>

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,309
runs as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply unmodified version of</font>

30
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,710
the DNS there's no no filtering as it

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be there's two different servers</font>

32
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,098
like you usually get with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS hey one is</font>

33
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,590
say any cast so it is a multiple

34
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:12,989
locations but the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP kind of like</font>

35
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,570
Google and<font color="#CCCCCC"> opendns does</font>

36
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,910
and the other one has redundancy as well

37
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,239
so they they there's more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

38
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:25,680
servers but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I piece they used</font>

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,980
quite a bit in Denmark but also in

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,710
various countries that have various

41
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,369
forms of DNS censorship or by users that

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,290
does just this likes the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of handing</font>

43
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,470
over over all the dns lookups to<font color="#E5E5E5"> google</font>

44
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,390
and doesn't wanna have logging and

45
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,230
censorship in their dns service

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,380
typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see a search of users from</font>

47
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:55,410
the country's when like the countries in

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:57,540
the news so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when turkey started</font>

49
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,670
censoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> twitter a few years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I saw</font>

50
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,070
a big rise in the number of users from

51
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">Turkey I have a lot of users from China</font>

52
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,359
which of course has massive internet

53
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,820
censorship and during Gareth's bring

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,920
different countries started appearing

55
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,950
both on on the web servers but but

56
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,170
mostly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the under dns service which is</font>

57
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,829
nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i can sit comfortably at</font>

58
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,359
home run a couple of dns servers is not

59
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,190
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that complicated and help people</font>

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,840
all around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world about censorship</font>

61
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:33,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> its really nice so I started running</font>

62
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:36,390
this in October 2009 so a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

63
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:41,070
after I started managing the ice PT and

64
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:44,429
his service mostly because friends and

65
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,260
and other people kept asking me what to

66
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,450
use instead of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice piece dns servers</font>

67
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,399
because the Pirate Bay have been blocked

68
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,290
and different other things were being

69
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,980
blocked so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were looking for</font>

70
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,620
alternatives at the time gouldian s did

71
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,359
not exist but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't have felt</font>

72
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,430
comfortable recommending them since they

73
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,460
already know enough about us without

74
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:09,150
having all our dns lookups so do not use

75
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:11,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google's DNS servers opendns did the</font>

76
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,130
thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NX domain redirection</font>

77
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,769
where if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> typo at the main name they</font>

78
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:20,070
redirect you the instead of returning an

79
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,169
NX domain error in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS response as</font>

80
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,060
they should they return an actual

81
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,159
response pointing to an IP address which

82
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,280
belongs to them which shows

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,310
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> does a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> search and say that you may</font>

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,969
be mean something which is of course a

85
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:38,700
violation of every<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've see and</font>

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">a horrible idea so I didn't want to</font>

87
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend them either also DNS is like</font>

88
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">what one of the most basic things</font>

89
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,280
concert controlling security on the

most other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like our CA system and</font>

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,080
all that is all based initiative you

antennas and email<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything is I</font>

95
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,110
you don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put forth a one to one to</font>

96
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,560
two or whatever they're called because

97
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,840
you heard somewhere that if you send

98
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">them a DNS query you get an answer back</font>

99
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,750
it's a matter of trust you need to find

100
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,700
that DNS provider like like you you

101
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,440
choose other providers you find somebody

169
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:56,809
of censoring them on the ice P service

170
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:59,930
when the domains are under the decayed

different domains it's typically

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:11,059
cybersquatting domains or sites that are

174
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:15,410
selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy merchandise like fake nike</font>

175

176
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,410
policy that they go to to the registry

177
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:25,758
and z's the domain and it's a weird

178
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:28,129
legal trick where they say they they

179
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">seize the domain as evidence which</font>

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:42,319

185
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,540
page saying this domain has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> seized</font>

186
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:47,599
by the police for the period of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

187
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:49,309
trial and when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they get the judges</font>

188
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,399
worth that it's illegal then the domain

189
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:56,120
is cancelled I guess so yep so they

190
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,009
actively take the domains away from from

191
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,420
people and and point them to the so the

192
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,420
police<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the main service</font>

193
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:13,370
okay so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> types of</font>

194
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,339
censorship like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said but the only the</font>

195
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> child abuse related blockings are</font>

196
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,870
automated in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the rest is</font>

197
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,850
handled on a case-by-case manually by

198
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:26,390
adding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that domains to sound files</font>

199
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,400
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a an automated system for</font>

200
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,640
the for the child abuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> list because</font>

201
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,360
it's it's updated every day or often and

202
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,880
so the ice P sense and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH public key</font>

203
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,250
to the police and they added to to their

204
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,830
server which<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list and the ISP</font>

205
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,589
uses a cron job to regularly fetch the

206
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:47,300
list with a SP and to format it into

207
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:49,430
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fits into the name server</font>

208
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,640
and then the name server starts

209
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,920
believing that it is authoritative for

210
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,810
those domains meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it will it</font>

211
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,569
will not do the regular recursion that

212
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:03,469
name servers should too they drool it

213
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:06,050
will answer with an IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address of a web</font>

214
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:09,589
server that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ISP has to run which</font>

215
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,839
says like stop you you are not allowed

216
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:16,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this domain it contains illegal</font>

219
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:26,209
with the excesses and the log file is

220
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:28,670
scrambled the IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is scrambled</font>

221
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:31,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's then said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the police every</font>

222
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:34,219
day they want this data so they can know

<font color="#E5E5E5">if they have 10,000 hits on the under</font>

225
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:42,440
thousand klicks of its 10,000 that guy's

226
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:45,170
doing one click but the ice please have

227
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,720
have demanded that they don't hand over

228
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,329
the the personal information so the IPS

229
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:55,459
a scrambled but when I took over

230
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:57,380
managing this system in in 27 the way of

231
00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:01,489
scrambling the IPS was to empty five

232
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:03,650
them with no salt and most people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

233
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,450
knows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there would be a small fee to</font>

234
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:08,300
make a rainbow table of all ipv4

235
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,670
addresses it will take<font color="#CCCCCC"> day on a laptop</font>

236
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,620
today which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that of course they</font>

237
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,810
were not anonymous at all so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police</font>

238
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,090
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted to able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ID</font>

239
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:23,040
if I who were accessing the start page

240
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:26,790
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system it's been in place</font>

241
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,949
for over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years now and it's by the</font>

242
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,620
police and save the children Denmark

243
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:36,390
shout proclaimed to be a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> success</font>

244
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:39,089
which is a blatant lie and it's a it's

245
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,430
self-serving for various reasons I don't

246
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:43,860
have time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go into the details</font>

247
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:45,839
but suffice to say that we from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

248
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,380
government in Denmark and from the you

249
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,390
give funding which is millions every

250
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:53,279
year to save the children<font color="#E5E5E5"> Denmark to</font>

251
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:57,300
operate the hotline where where people

252
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,310
can report the domains and and this hard

253
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,050
line then forwards the domains to the

254
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,500
police and the police added to the

255
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:08,069
blogging list and if you if you if

256
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:09,960
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask like once a year</font>

257
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,550
there's a story in the news where Save

258
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,960
the Children and police say that it's a

259
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,630
great success and we should keep the

260
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:18,390
censorship going but if you're going to

261
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask if something is a good idea then</font>

262
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:24,089
it's it's you shouldn't ask people who

263
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,490
are getting paid if it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to</font>

264
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep doing it because obviously they're</font>

265
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to vote to remove their own</font>

266
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,420
funding it would be insane so even

267
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,990
though they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> good intentions I</font>

268
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,180
believe that that they're being that

269
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:42,600
they're being dishonest about<font color="#CCCCCC"> if agency</font>

270
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this to keep their funding and to to</font>

271
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,760
to symbolically look like they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,400
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something even though they</font>

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,839
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually harming doing more</font>

274
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:59,160
harm than good which I will cover now

275
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there's a whole bunch of issues</font>

276
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,380
doing censorship in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS some of them</font>

277
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,839
relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all kinds of censorship some</font>

278
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,930
of them only relevant for when you are

279
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,820
censoring child abuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> content but but</font>

280
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll go through them in no particular

281
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,400
order first of all we have this blogging

282
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,230
page saying if you if you go to a web

283

browser and enter one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the block</font>

284
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,310
domains it says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not allowed</font>

285
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:25,560
to go through it but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for</font>

286
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,630
HTTP and as people here well<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,970
this but but it is if for example you

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,270
send an email to one of the block

291
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,950

294
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,680
doesn't run a mail service but if they

295
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:47,920
wanted to they could intercept all the

296
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,430
mail for these domains but as it is the

297
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,050
port 25 isn't it even open so it would

298
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,819
sit there you're sending mail server

299
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,310
would sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and chew on it for the</font>

four days specified in the smtp<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioc's</font>

and then you'd get a bounds which is of

302
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:09,640
course stupid it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is also a really big</font>

303
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,440
problem that that the blogging system we

304
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,510
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a single point of failure</font>

305
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,670
introduced into an otherwise redundant

306
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,530
system dns is one of the only things we

307
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:20,020
have where where this explicitly

308
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:22,449
specified in the rfcs everywhere they do

309
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,770
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to at least servers and</font>

310
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,210
there needs to be on separate subnets

311
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,819
and all this all this is of course

312
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:31,030
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is so important that we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't go away that we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want we</font>

don't want it to be down ever so when

315
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,420
you do a system like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

316
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,400
automatically updates a list of blocked

317
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,319
domains and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> something goes wrong</font>

318
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,240
then you introduce a single point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

319
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,880
failure into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system and this</font>

320
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,130
happened in 2012 when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few is peace</font>

321
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,040
among them was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I was working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

322
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:56,680

323
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,510
happens periodically like I said and and

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like our customer service was</font>

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:03,460
bombarded with calls ironically safe the

accessing child porn a warning page

331
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:16,240

333
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,570
domains which like google com and

334
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube and Facebook among them and then</font>

335
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,400
all those domains were blocked and

336
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:31,990
people were seeing the stop child abuse

337
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:35,500
thing page so this is of course that was

338
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:39,010
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> disaster and and should have ended the</font>

system immediately but it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

340
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,460
then

341
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:46,400
and I was pretty proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a block on</font>

00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Washington Post where we Denmark and</font>

ship this this week or something like

that always nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be compared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

348
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,199
block child<font color="#CCCCCC"> abuse content like we do in</font>

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,419
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS these DNS servers are publicly</font>

350
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,730
available of course so anybody who's a

customer with the ISP with any ISP<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

352
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:29,840
then my the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I mean we</font>

353
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">all agree that the people who run child</font>

00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:40,879
most despicable people we can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

356
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:43,520
but but if you if you block in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

357
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,200
like we do you actually run a pretty

358
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,430
well funded early warning system for

359
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,980
these criminals so you're actually

360
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,650
actively helping them because as soon as

361
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,190
you add one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the domains to the the</font>

362
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,080
blocking list it'll cost him<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kronus</font>

363
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,730

364
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,889
so he can do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lookup on a tiny server</font>

365
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,050
and when he sees<font color="#CCCCCC"> that his domain is</font>

366
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,390
suddenly not resolving to the proper IP

367
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:07,220
anymore but to some IP belonging to the

368
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISP and resolving to the blogging page</font>

369
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,180
then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> he can change the name of</font>

370
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">his side he knows he's been detected by</font>

371
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,670
the authorities and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he can run and run</font>

372
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:19,040
his service continue his service on

373
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,160
under different name so what we're doing

374
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,600
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only ineffective anybody who</font>

375
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,450
actually wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to access list us they</font>

376
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,310
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any way through it so in a</font>

377
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,560
million other ways but we're actively

378
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,659
helping the people who are hosting this

379
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,370
content by warning them when we found

380
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:43,520
them which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course absolutely</font>

381
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:46,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">stupid more issues so DNS censorship</font>

382
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,340
conceals problems without actually

383
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,300
removing them it's like pulling the

384
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,669
curtains to something bad going on

385
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,080
the red the correct correct course of

386
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,850
action when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find something like this</font>

387
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,649
is of course not to add it to a

388
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,840
censorship list but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the content</font>

389
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,930
taken offline and don't believe for a

390
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,639
second the stories that that that we

391
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,950
operate this censorship because it's

392
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">impossible to get the content away it</font>

393
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:16,630
absolutely is possible three or<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

394
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago a German got a leak of the of</font>

the of the blood list of blocked domain

somebody I don't know who leaked the

domains like ninety percent of them by

400
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,450
either dead or were like parking pages

401
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,760
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this page is this domain is for</font>

402
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,380
sale or this page is hosted by something

403
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,550
something without actual concern on them

404
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,560
a few were regular porn sites and a very

405
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,419
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think three sides he found in the</font>

406
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,120
whole list that actually had illegal

407
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,040
content and he as a civilian with no

408
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,560
authority at all contacted the hosting

409
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,899
providers and had<font color="#CCCCCC"> all three pages taken</font>

down in<font color="#E5E5E5"> less than 24 hours these were</font>

is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is keeping the content online for</font>

416
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:19,420
much longer than if we actively try to

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:22,930
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it offline which pisses me off ok</font>

418
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:25,360
so the inner censorship is also

incomparable incompatible with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the NSA</font>

432
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,960
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had image-sharing sites where the</font>

433
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,980
a load of legal consent was taken

434
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,620
offline

435
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:08,530
which is of course never a good thing

436
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:11,379
and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said I started out by saying</font>

437
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:15,639
it tends to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slippery slope when you</font>

438
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:17,200
do censorship because you tend to to to

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,960
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the censorship for smaller smaller</font>

440
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,940
infractions and and and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

441
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,100
becomes like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Swiss Army knife so if</font>

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like Islamic extremist</font>

447
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,309
wanted to add that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the list as well</font>

448
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:46,270
now and of course blogging stuff for

449
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:49,450
political reasons this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like something</font>

450
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:55,480
we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done with a society long</font>

long<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so stop believing that hiding a</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> bodiless is de stupid it is actively</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it is actively harming I mean if we</font>

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,059
another offense then of course keeping

the content online for one second longer

460

462
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:33,580
which brings me to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've</font>

an agriculture than here and and I've

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,559
been saying this and don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's as</font>

468
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,199
relevant to say it here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you</font>

469
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,360
people are painfully aware with this but

470
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,520
there is a basic conflict between

471
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,540
security and freedom on Sunday some

472
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,950
level and they always will be there's no

473
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,510
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my name service can be</font>

476
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,250
can come sis access points and switches

477
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,260
here be used and I mean the roads can be

479
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,440
of course they can there's no question

<font color="#CCCCCC">about that</font>

481
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,480
when you run open resolvers they can

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,820
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used in the amplification at sex</font>

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:27,100
with which has happened and and its

484
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:30,309
continuing to heaven and but stuff like

things that people here work with from

00:23:32,139 --> 00:23:38,500
day to day<font color="#E5E5E5"> are dual edged like that they</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential for abuse and we need to</font>

accept this and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware</font>

492
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:51,070
aware of that when we are discussing

<font color="#E5E5E5">these things that that there is a</font>

have both but but you always already<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

already knew that of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always</font>

497
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,029
like it when i'm done with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> political</font>

part of the compression season and gets

some IP space from ripe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we</font>

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:29,769
ran out which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really lucky i have a</font>

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:31,870
/ 24 before range and / 48 v6 range and

503
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:34,690
an a is number which means i can do any

504
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,969
cast for one of the servers any cast is

505
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,549
a method where you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP announced the</font>

506
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,200
same IP address from from several

507
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:43,299
locations so i can have a server in

508
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">copenhagen and one in amsterdam and one</font>

509
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:47,799
in New York which which always went to

510
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same IP and depending on where you</font>

511
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,549
are pgp whys and the instant network

512
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:54,009
wise and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet you would hit the</font>

513
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:55,870
server that is routing wise closest to

514
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:58,210
you which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

515
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,610
geographically closest as well because

516
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:04,830
the internet is so interconnected these

517
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:08,729
days you all know this from

518
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:11,610
Netflix & goo goo and everybody is doing

519
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,470
any cars because which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

520
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:15,149
access like a netflix server Google

521
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,250
server you will get one typically in

522
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:18,959
your own country in<font color="#CCCCCC"> most countries they</font>

523
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,000
have caches these days but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are still</font>

524
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,850
accessing the same IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

525
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,899
same domain names they just they just do

526
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:31,439
magic in BGP to to make you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

527
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:34,408
closest server it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice</font>

528
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,870
getting these ranges and come sit down

529
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:39,389
here helped get it and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font>

530
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:43,260
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a permanent assignment I</font>

531
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:45,510
can keep these IPS for forever and which

532
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,950
means that I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to change even</font>

533
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:51,990
if I move providers and I can we do much

534
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:53,399
much better redundancy and I can get

535
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">better performance because if i put a</font>

536
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:57,658
server in<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia than I my Chinese users</font>

537
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:59,549
will hit that one because they have

538
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:01,590
latency issues of course because they

539
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:05,760
live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> china and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i live in denmark or</font>

00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:08,789
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers live in denmark so so bad</font>

541
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,169
it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> running the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cow services</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">running we have a few notes in Denmark</font>

543
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:15,539
but of course I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always need more notes</font>

544
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,190
to to make the anycast service more

545
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:19,649
responsive and more redundant more

546
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,630
stable so if anybody works for a

547
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:24,389
provider which can it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't need to be</font>

with this please let me know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I</font>

556
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,679
was talking a bit about DNS

557
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,210
amplification and and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely</font>

558
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:57,330
a problem with open resolvers and

559
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,909
basically it's it's discouraged to run

560
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:02,129
open resolvers these days because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

561
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:04,529
potential for<font color="#E5E5E5"> abuse but like I said we</font>

562
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,510
have to accept some abuse if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

563
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:08,820
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> services which enhanced the</font>

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,110
help a lot with with the DNS

567
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,960
amplification it is so inspired by PHP

568
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:21,889
dampening which is a

569
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,529
a system where you sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many ppl</font>

dates too quickly you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get like silenced</font>

571
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:30,140
for a bit so you get ignored kind of so

572
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,539
even if you send most of it won't be

573
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:35,510
processed at ens dampening is kind of

574
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:38,029
like that it'sit's rate-limiting but not

575
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:40,340
like the typical kind where you where

576
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:43,700
you set a firm limit like this IP can do

577
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:47,330
this many lookups / x seconds or

578
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:49,850
whatever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't really work for DNS</font>

579
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:52,220
because i have i have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> isps using my</font>

580
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,889
service small<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes piece which mean they</font>

581
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,950
have like maybe a few thousand users

582
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,450
behind one IP so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I set a limit then</font>

583
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set it so high that I can</font>

584
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,010
have two thousand users behind one IP

585
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:05,419
and which would make it pointless

586
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,539
because then I would never catch the

587
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:12,890
axial abusers so like stupid plain old

588
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:15,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">rate-limiting is not for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dennis which is</font>

589
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,850
why it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird why I see went</font>

590
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,980
with the response rate limiting they

591
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:22,010
built in to bind but I'll get back to

592
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS dampening is rate-limiting</font>

593
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:27,500
based on a scoring system where where

594
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the size of the packets that's the</font>

595
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,750
difference in size from the incoming

596
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,850
query to the outgoing response is used

597
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,700
to calculate a score for each query and

598
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,770
then add it up and if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> over some</font>

599
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,110
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of points because you've made a</font>

600
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:44,240
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of small queries with large</font>

601
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:46,549
responses over a short time the new get

602
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,760
blocked and after<font color="#E5E5E5"> while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font>

603
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:52,789
unblocked again so it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a idiot</font>

604
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,740
it's like a scoring system if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> repeat</font>

605
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:56,840
the same query over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over and don't</font>

606
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,539
like alternate the queries you get

607
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">penalized way more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than if you have a</font>

608
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,140
more regular pattern which like if

609
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,090
you're surfing you still do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

610
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,039
lookups but you don't do the same look

611
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,260
up again and again and again any

612
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,950
operating system resolver has its own

613
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:15,408
local caches so you will never see is

614
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,840
seatalk any query a hundred times in a

615
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:20,659
row<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the same IP that's so obviously</font>

616
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:26,029
abuse so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> get penalized heavier</font>

617
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:31,429
it works really really really well it

618
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:33,859
cut my number of queries and I have

619
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:36,739
removed ninety percent of the queries

620
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:38,149
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just abuse a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

621
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:39,919
when I started<font color="#CCCCCC"> using this it is</font>

622
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:41,809
amazingly effective and I don't

623
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,849
understand why why it isn't built into

624
00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:47,840
every single dns server software on the

625
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:49,428
planet it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> de petsafe apparent that</font>

626
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,918
i'm using is developed by a german guy

627
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:53,330
called luciana heger he isn't

628
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,529
maintaining it anymore so at the moment

629
00:29:53,330 --> 00:30:00,590
I'm having to to hand maintain a<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch</font>

630
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:02,359
set for bind which is a pretty fast

631
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,519
moving target and a pretty large and a

632
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:08,869
pretty idiotic code place in a pretty

633
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:11,090
idiotic language so so I want to

634
00:30:08,869 --> 00:30:13,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">separate this out of mind I want a</font>

635
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,999
separate piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software to sit in</font>

636
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:19,099
front of any any DNS server so so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

637
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:20,659
more freely choose which dns server

638
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:22,340
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to use and just have</font>

639
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:24,919
this proxy sitting in front which does

640
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,349
the scoring of the clients and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

641
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:29,840
penalizing so it doesn't forward the

642
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:31,849
queries to the peg and dns server if a

643
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,340
client should be silenced because it's

644
00:30:31,849 --> 00:30:40,309
doing too many lookups also you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font>

645
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:42,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">tcp fall back in dns of course if you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a response on UDP your</font>

647
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:50,599
resolver retries with tcp because of

648
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:52,129
historically cisco has been pretty

649
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,609
retarded about this they've been

650
00:30:52,129 --> 00:31:00,379
blogging packets which is more than 512

651
00:30:55,609 --> 00:31:01,699
parts which means you can you can send a

652
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:04,279
question where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> never see the</font>

653
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,889
response because they for some reason

654
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:09,619
belief that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns response would never</font>

655
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:11,478
be over for 512 parts which means that

656
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:14,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">we built in a fall back in the system</font>

657
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:18,320
where you retry with<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp which means you</font>

658
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:20,200
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get bigger packets through but tcp i</font>

659
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,049
mean this this

660
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,750
where's proof these amplification the

661
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:28,779
text is of course spoofed traffic coming

662
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:31,990
from looking like<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are coming from</font>

663
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:35,260
the IPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually being attacked so</font>

664
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:38,919
the IPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see on my server is a spoofed</font>

665
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:42,429
sending address but if I block somebody

666
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:44,470
for doing too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries and they I</font>

667
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:47,440
then get a connection over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP from the</font>

668
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:49,840
same IP then I know it's a it's it's not

669
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,850
spoofed traffic i'm seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

sees p fall back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns is really</font>

674
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,299
important at this regard because it you

could use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to to know that you have</font>

falsely a dense false positive in your

00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,200
in your dampening and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then whitelist the</font>

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:16,090
something so am<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> help to</font>

00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:18,939
build an earl and paste proxy for this

682
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,049
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to do is to to use this</font>

these people back to know when a client

is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I mean sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

685
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:30,129
doing something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the DNS with which</font>

686
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:32,649
causes myself to get blocked because I'm

00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:35,409
checking something<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsx stuff and at the</font>

688
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:37,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">end I sectors mean larger responses of</font>

689
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:40,360
course because you need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixers to</font>

690
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:43,240
fit in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get myself blocked which is</font>

691
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,850
really stupid and but if only I had a

692
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">system where because my machine when it</font>

693
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,389
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a response will without me</font>

694
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,639
even knowing it tried this before back

695
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:55,809
so it would be very nice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that as</font>

696
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:58,000
well it looks like this I don't know if

697
00:32:55,809 --> 00:33:03,210
you can see it but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

698
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,210
client and a query for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

699
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">a and an any query so it wants the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

700
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,450
set of Records deserve a nose and it's

701
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:14,389
coming appearing to come from some IP

702
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:16,580
and it that's the same look exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

703
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:19,220
logo a bunch of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 10 20 times</font>

704
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,689
in a second and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it waits 10 seconds</font>

705
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then it does the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same query again</font>

706
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:26,720
and it starts out by having zero points

707
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:30,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then goes to 110 3 11 6 12,000 1500</font>

708
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,050
2000 and pretty soon it reaches 25,000

709
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:35,240
and then it's a dampening is activated

710
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:37,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see anything from it</font>

711
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,150
for 10-15 minutes or something and then

712
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:42,560
the dampening system slowly triggers the

713
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:45,470
scores down and when it gets below

714
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,780
25,000 it will get responses again but

715
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,420
if the first thing it does is to make

716
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:53,389
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these high scoring high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> penalized</font>

717
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:55,040
queries it will quickly go above 25,000

718
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,800
again so i will only see one or two

719
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:00,020
packets which energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> does is nothing i</font>

720
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,350
mean it's it's effectively removed the

721
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:07,160
problem of these repeat repeat queries

722
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:09,409
there are variations which this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lex</font>

723
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,970
less effective against<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if I can move</font>

724
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:14,240
remove ninety percent of the abuse

725
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:15,439
pretty easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> but be stupid not to do it</font>

726
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">just because it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't a hundred percent</font>

727
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:24,470
effective this also goes in much of the

728
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:28,129
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer security as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

729
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:31,219
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns dampening code on</font>

730
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:34,310

731
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:36,290
to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not just because I it's a</font>

732
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,840
hassle keeping the the pet said

<font color="#E5E5E5">option at least to move away from bind</font>

735
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:45,020
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> servers are maturing so much</font>

736
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,210
faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> so fast and and they have really</font>

737
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:50,750
neat features unbound and at the other

738
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:55,490
so but at the moment I'm forced to stay

739
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:57,770
on bind which is annoying so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:01,819
much looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward to the to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the park</font>

741
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:03,800

742
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,050
statistics for for dampening and a few

743
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:11,570
statistics for for the rest of the

744
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:13,520
service about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4,000 times and 24 hours I</font>

745
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,800
had actively

746
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,910
I was dampening was activated for

747
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:24,020
foreign IP and those four thousand times

748
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:26,629
was 1763 unique IP addresses so it's

749
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,490
they come back I mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all but</font>

750
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course doing this and the code</font>

751
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:33,049
might be aware of what i'm doing and

752
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:35,660
trying to come back but but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

753
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:38,780
it if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets blocked and stops</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed</font>

755
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,710
then maybe it comes back an hour later

756
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:49,670
two hours later and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets blocked</font>

757
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:52,340
again so so about two dampening events<font color="#CCCCCC"> /</font>

758
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:55,370
IP / 24 hours or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that on</font>

759
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,500
average but some of them are much more

760
00:35:55,370 --> 00:36:00,290
aggressive aggressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top one was</font>

761
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:03,080
put in tampering 119 times in 24 hours

762
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:06,170
and some of these like we know from from

763
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,250
the other talks and and generally some

764
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,080
button is our way more sophisticated

765
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:10,760
than others some code is way more

766
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">intelligent that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this something is some</font>

767
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,680
things are maybe just brute-forcing just

768
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:18,080
stupidly sending endlessly and not

769
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">checking whether the the response has</font>

770
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:25,370
come in on it so and it varies a lot

771
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:28,280
this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one random day and and the</font>

772
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:30,799
numbers are a bit a bit out because yeah

773
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,590
so but it there's absolutely no question

774
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,330
that dampening works wonders for me and

775
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:37,130
it means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have to feel as</font>

776
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:40,009
guilty about running an open resolver as

777
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:42,800
I I usually used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do because they do</font>

778
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,060
get used to hammer people's servers and

779
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,790
stuff and of course I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to be a</font>

780
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:48,799
part of that but we also i bet a lot of

781
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,720
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in here runs all relays even</font>

782
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,180
though we know that a small part of the

783
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic that runs through so is illegal</font>

00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:04,790

00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:07,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so they see about 200 maybe up to</font>

787
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:10,400
300 queries per second each servant the

balance that will across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the configured</font>

791
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:21,560
resolvers these numbers are without the

792
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,900
dampening with dampening enabled so and

793
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not counting the other partner</font>

794
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,390
traffic that's filled that out it is the

795
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">number</font>

796
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:31,609
a way way way higher when they're

797
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:35,480
burning is off and when suddenly bind

798
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:40,130
releases their parking number<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million</font>

799
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:43,130
this year and I'm I'm for a while I have

800
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:45,559
to like update<font color="#E5E5E5"> by and right now and then</font>

801
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,839
I have to pretty quickly get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pet set</font>

802
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:50,299
updated to whatever whatever bind is

803
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,250
doing now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in</font>

804
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:53,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">between there I see the bandwidth on my</font>

805
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,579
servers and everything go up because I

806
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,720
have these small windows where where

807
00:37:55,579 --> 00:38:01,549
where I don't have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pet ship edit so</font>

808
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,160
so it would be really good to get this

809
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:06,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem solved a little over ten</font>

810
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,279
thousand unique IP addresses in 24 hours

811
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:12,169
but I have no idea how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many users it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

812
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:15,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely impossible to say but I know</font>

813
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:19,910
a few small ISPs are using them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know a</font>

814
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:22,190
tom in China is using one of the is

815
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,690
using them over ipv6 because some guy

816
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,460
they have found some way to get through

817
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:28,460
their firewall so he can get uncensored

818
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:31,819
tienes look out for the whole dome over

819
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:34,789
ipv6 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> III really don't know how many</font>

820
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:37,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">users but quite a few this is in 24</font>

821
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:40,970
hours ten thousand six hundred unique IP

822
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:42,890
addresses this is not counting some

823
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:47,149
people enabled the some pretty

824
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:49,970
aggressive ipv6 privacy features where

825
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:53,240
each look up looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes from a</font>

826
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:55,339
new / 64 address in this less fixed 64

827
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,439
that's configured so you can figure your

828
00:38:55,339 --> 00:39:00,500
your machine should do outbound

829
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,490
translation at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> soul suppress and one</font>

830
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:07,099
day I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got up and I had like thirty</font>

831
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,930
thousand new users since yesterday or

832
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:13,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay something has to be wrong</font>

833
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:16,578
and it was all from the same / 64 so I'm

834
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:18,769
counting in these numbers / 64 as one IP

835
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:22,069
which also isn't correct of course

836
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:27,229
because here for example we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all I</font>

837
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:29,390
think in the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> / 64 I don't know but</font>

838
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:33,740
but definitely you can easily have more

839
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:38,029
users than one in the same / 64 so I

840
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:39,669
also have some some some query type

841
00:39:38,029 --> 00:39:42,099
distribution

842
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:44,680
but the data is a bit old<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't able</font>

843
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:47,589
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to updating them so I</font>

844
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,779
would expect I'll make the presentation

845
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:52,058
available if you want to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to study</font>

846
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:55,089
the numbers but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would expect the the</font>

847
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:57,910
quad a lookups to have risen since this

848
00:39:55,089 --> 00:40:01,240
and especially the dears lookups and the

850
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,970
other DNS SEC related because much more

851
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:09,280
traffic is much more many many more

852
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:16,118
systems at the NSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> go where now than</font>

always find fascinating I don't know

00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:25,540
what system out there is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

857
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:28,569
deliver mail trying to look up a male be

858
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:34,930
record but but something somewhere needs

859
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:38,799
to be updated that's for sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'm</font>

860
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:40,450
primarily included this to show the the

861
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:43,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom number this shows how many</font>

862
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:46,509
lookups was received I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

863
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:49,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">know over how much time these numbers of</font>

864
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right but it's just the relationship</font>

865
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:58,960
between receiving 31.8 million ipv4

866
00:40:54,130 --> 00:41:02,109
requests and 53,000 ipv6 requests and

867
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,880
then 24.5 million of them that's the

868
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:08,859
button number<font color="#E5E5E5"> are dropped due to</font>

869
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:11,470
dampening so yeah 25 24 25 million out

870
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:13,930
of 31 million is its partner traffic and

871
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:20,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is filtered out that's a that's a</font>

872
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:22,058
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> percentage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i switch to using</font>

873
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,970
ansible to manage the servers a while

874
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:26,920
ago or am in the process of doing so it

875
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:31,450
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely awesome it makes it way</font>

876
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:33,849
easier to have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attentively</font>

877
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,520
identically configured anycast notes

878
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:37,869
which is of course important if you're

879
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,420
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the stuff</font>

880
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:43,180
is configured consistently and

881
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:46,210
identically and to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy to</font>

882
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,649
update stuff and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't put the</font>

883
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,089
stuff on github yet but it will be at

884
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,470
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and if you haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used it</font>

885
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:53,000
and you have some systems to end in

886
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:55,759
style I cannot recommend it higher

887
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,160
it is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very very nice system</font>

888
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,870
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole bond heck</font>

889
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,779
infrastructure was also built using

890
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:04,970
ansible and all that stuff is public on

891
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,120
our github repository so you can see how

892
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:12,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the web servers and all that stuff</font>

893
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:23,299
has been built in the ansible play books

894
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:28,790
that we've published<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there is a a</font>

895
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:32,120
privacy issue and like a last mile issue

896
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:34,400
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS where we have dns sac now which</font>

897
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,870
secures the path between the research

898
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,690
because of resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the authority of</font>

899
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:41,299
server it it authenticates it but it

900
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:44,630
does not encrypt it and the last bit

901
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:47,420
between my servers and the laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

902
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:52,190
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are is doing the lookup is</font>

903
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:53,690
unsigned it you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the signature</font>

904
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,910
when you get it down<font color="#CCCCCC"> per typically you</font>

905
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,340
in DNS SEC the idea is that your

906
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,049
recursive resolver does the signature

907
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,020
checking for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tells you whether</font>

908
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:05,390
it is validly signed or not your client

909
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't actually check this so the last</font>

910
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:10,790
bit is vulnerable both to both privacy

911
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,380
reasons like everybody can see in clear

912
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:16,310
text what you're doing and it's also

913
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:18,380
unauthenticated so a while back<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

914
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:22,759
started looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how to solve this and</font>

915
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:25,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">at that point in a script was enough sad</font>

916
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,380
state I had this with the kind software

917
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,330
was pretty horrible and the server

918
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:31,940
software didn't work at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

919
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:35,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">for me so after trying a bit and playing</font>

920
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,820
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go wait a</font>

921
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">few years and may let it mature and in</font>

922
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:45,200
the meantime I<font color="#E5E5E5"> did an openvpn project</font>

923
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:47,660
where I I published some keys

924
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,430
credentials to log into an openvpn

925
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:52,190
server I was running on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS server</font>

926
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:55,040
it only permits<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff traffic on CCP and</font>

927
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:59,089
UDP port 53 and so you basically dial in

928
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:02,808
everybody gets uses the same key and

929
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:04,759
you you can figure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DBP n n point IP</font>

930
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:06,950
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server and it just turns it</font>

931
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:09,799
over openvpn it is a pretty simple

932
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:13,189
solution it doesn't scale that well I

933
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:15,410
can't do 10,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> open VPN connections on</font>

934
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:18,859
the Sun at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NS server as easy as I</font>

935
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:20,989
can do 10,000 dns server clients but it

936
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:22,819
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> really well and the openvpn has</font>

937
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:25,039
kinds for a lot of operating system so

938
00:44:22,819 --> 00:44:27,140
it's been a nice interim solution it's

939
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,660
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> running but but probably not for</font>

940
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:32,450
long because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alternatives are</font>

941
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:35,479
beginning to look much better one of the

942
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:37,249
alternatives is now its DNA script it is

943
00:44:35,479 --> 00:44:40,968
i'm looking into it again it has matured

944
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:42,259
a lot since then both the their software

945
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:48,109
their website and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole project</font>

946
00:44:42,259 --> 00:44:49,579
seems considerably better now they have

947
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:52,308
support for a whole bunch of operating

948
00:44:49,579 --> 00:44:54,349
systems which is awesome and i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

949
00:44:52,309 --> 00:44:57,680
will be doing a public test of this

950
00:44:54,349 --> 00:45:01,339
pretty soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it goes well i will put</font>

951
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:03,200
it into production on my service but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

952
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:06,078
am actually even more excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

953
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,950
new tienes over<font color="#CCCCCC"> till SRC that came out</font>

954
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:15,259
it to me it seems like a really really

955
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:16,910
good way to do this we have a but you

956
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:19,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">can dear etfc it's not that long but</font>

957
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:25,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you establish at CLS</font>

958
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:28,788
connection on GSP port 853 its uses pki

959
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:31,788
you can either use the it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

960
00:45:28,789 --> 00:45:36,380
client how to verify the key of course

961
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:38,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">the public key but but it supports which</font>

962
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,729
i think is important like HTTP public

963
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:43,190
key pinning it supports pin sets so you

964
00:45:40,729 --> 00:45:45,200
can publish<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of band or</font>

965
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,789
somewhere I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could publish the</font>

966
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,249
fingerprints i'm using for my dns

967
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:52,489
servers and i can publish an extra set

968
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:54,259
so if the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one gets gets</font>

969
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:56,359
compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can switch to the second</font>

970
00:45:54,259 --> 00:45:59,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">one and people will still have know how</font>

971
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:01,308
to sew it enables the clients to

972
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:03,499
validate the server so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do men</font>

973
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:07,130
the middle stuff anymore you can do like

974
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:10,459
chillin or in<font color="#CCCCCC"> norway actually</font>

975
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:12,770
intercepting port 53 traffic going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

976
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:16,250
dns servers and redirecting it

977
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:18,560
to their own not<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS a enabled DNS</font>

978
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,300
servers so people in Norway who are

979
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,910
customers at siren or who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually</font>

980
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to use to improve their security</font>

981
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:27,799

00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:29,420
server are being redirected to a server

983
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,490
with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse security they are</font>

984
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,890
actively lying they're redirecting

985
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,450
transparently so people think they're

986
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:38,629
using uncensored DNS but they're

987
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:39,950
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> using another server for that</font>

988
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,740
reason I'm running a service called

989
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:46,460
check dot uncensored<font color="#E5E5E5"> tionesta dock where</font>

990
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:49,189
you can take a txt record at that name

991
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,500
and it responds with a sentence saying

992
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:54,890
congratulations you are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> uncensored</font>

993
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:56,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">eNOS or know you IPO dns server IP is</font>

994
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:59,540
this so you can use that to detect

995
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:00,680
interception of your DNS traffic and see

996
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,230
which at risk solver you are actually

997
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">using this can also I should be useful</font>

998
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,880
if you have a complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of orders</font>

1000
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,510
directory stuff configured it can be

1001
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:14,210
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it actually</font>

1002

exits so one resolver is forwarding to

another which forward into a third and

1004
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:20,270
you can really<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out where the hell</font>

1005
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:21,950
it actually leaves and goes out to do

1006
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,680
the recursion to the authority of

1007
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers so you can use this to figure</font>

out where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually exiting the</font>

recursive DNS system the Pope code for

to the NSA would seal is it makes it

1016
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:54,049
possible to it like it both secures the

it authenticated which is the two things

1019
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:01,220
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need the most and units right now so</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get this online soon as</font>

1021
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:07,790
well but the DNS is fairly new the RFC

00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:09,530
is fairly new<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and that the software</font>

1027
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,630
pretty pessimistic and I've been right

1028
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:29,390
for most of the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so probably</font>

1029
00:48:26,630 --> 00:48:32,210
the future will will also offer new

1030
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:34,759
weird ideas about how to censor stuff

1031
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:37,549
online we it might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any DNS</font>

1032
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:39,859
anymore it might be on an IP level it

1033
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:42,230
might be some deep packet inspection we

1034
00:48:39,859 --> 00:48:44,538
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an ISP in Denmark who has</font>

1035
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:46,970
implemented the requirements for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

1036
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:49,819
censorship with Pierre deep packet

1037
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:54,529
inspection so if you are on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is P</font>

1038
00:48:49,819 --> 00:48:57,920
which is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and you say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to telnet</font>

1039
00:48:54,529 --> 00:49:00,500
to Google one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google that comes DNS</font>

1040
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,680
servers and then write-host colon

1041
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,869
grooveshark com then the TCP session is

1042
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:07,399
closed because that the para que<font color="#E5E5E5"> pagar</font>

1043
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:10,279
inspection sees the host header and

1044
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,609
doesn't matter which IP address it goes

1045
00:49:10,279 --> 00:49:15,890
to because it inspects all traffic this

1046
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:17,839
might become more common it's a

1047

dangerous<font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start playing to</font>

1048
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,490
inspect traffic like this at least when

1049
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:25,038
we're doing the censorship in Indian s

1050
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:27,799
it is really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people to to</font>

1051
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:32,569
circumvent which is why I'm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I'm</font>

00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:34,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to make it even easier either way</font>

1053
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:36,470
my dns servers will keep running as long

1054
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,690
as there's a need for them and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i fear</font>

1055
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:42,049
that i will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here for some</font>

considerable time into the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1057
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:45,710
like i said<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for more notes for</font>

the UNAC house project because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1059
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:51,559
greatly improve the performance and

1061
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:56,690
it will also enable me to to surf the

the political issues and some of the

reasoning behind all the hate against

to spread the word I mean Fred spread

the word used to servers do not use

use a random IP address you got

somewhere you know who your DNS provider

down and 24 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something Oh 30</font>

1099
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:32,690
questions yeah

1100

1101
00:51:52,099 --> 00:52:01,039
timeline you're right there was one in

1102
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,450
Turkey as well but the same trademark

1103
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,279
they apparently very aggressive about

1104
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:06,618
using the word home for real estate

1105
00:52:04,279 --> 00:52:21,680
which is kind of what what else would

1106
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:31,549
you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's just stupid right of</font>

1107
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:42,859
course so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the brat going rate</font>

1108
00:52:31,549 --> 00:52:44,900
for a sensor domain these days nice that

1109
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:46,759
there hasn't really been any any

1110
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,520
activity towards trying to clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

1111
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:54,380
list when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote for like for the years</font>

1112
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:56,538
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying to trying to to to</font>

1113
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,890
manage the sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> service that the</font>

1114
00:52:56,539 --> 00:53:00,109
number of domains has been almost

1115
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:01,910
constantly rising and then at one point

1116
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:03,859
there was some debate about this and

1117
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:05,450
they cleaned it up and removed a couple

1118
00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:06,890
of thousand domains and since then it's

1119
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,629
been rising as well so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been like a</font>

1120
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:11,089
graph going like this and then someone

1121
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:15,289
complained and went like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and now so</font>

1122
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:16,700
they're not cleaning up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much and I</font>

1123
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:18,529
fear that's one of the problems because

1124
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,149
like with all legislation and stuff like

1125
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,619
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy to implement but</font>

1126
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,750
it's nobody cares about removing and

1127
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:26,029
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should be some sort of expiry</font>

1128
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:28,460
date or something on not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

1129
00:53:26,029 --> 00:53:32,630
censorship but probably all legislation

1130
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:34,640
so when when it gets times our you have

1131
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:36,890
to actively introduce it again if you

1132
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:41,828
still want it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it is right now</font>

1133
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:52,989
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> is cleaning up that's been</font>

1134
00:53:41,829 --> 00:54:03,039
and just one of the domains of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being the</font>

1135
00:53:52,989 --> 00:54:06,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">coolest which they have action and it</font>

1136
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:09,130
turns out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to do that they</font>

1137
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:15,940
had to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the judge signed original</font>

mud might probably be using some some

1153
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:37,060
fancier crypto but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've like I said</font>

1154
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:40,089
I had some pretty bad experiences with

1155
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:42,430
it so maybe I'm just like bias you know

00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:46,509
with some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> crappy software you're</font>

00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,369
reluctant to go back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try again but</font>

1159
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:50,950
like I said it has matured greatly and

1160
00:55:48,369 --> 00:55:56,470
I'm aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> CLS is not without its</font>

1161
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:58,299
problems so so yeah no I'm not I think

1165
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:42,220

1166
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:47,950
