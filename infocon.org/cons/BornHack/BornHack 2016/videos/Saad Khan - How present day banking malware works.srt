1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
my name is sodden I work for CSIS I'm

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,000
going to be talking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit about</font>

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,309
the banking malware first I'd like to

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">explain what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually is so the</font>

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,969
banking malware is the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware</font>

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,330
which is designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal money from</font>

7
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,070
the bank accounts of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the</font>

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,080
malware which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed to attack</font>

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,470
banks and steal money directly from them

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:30,630
but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to use the users and</font>

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,159
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trick them into basically giving</font>

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,230
away their<font color="#E5E5E5"> money so there are many</font>

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,730
factors in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be talking about</font>

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,790
different phases of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attack</font>

15
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,069
historically speaking it's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one</font>

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,579
of the biggest problems in last<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decade</font>

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">or so Zeus was the first banking malware</font>

18
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,190
that was widely popular and over the

19
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,210
years security products have kept

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,940
improving and so did the banking network

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,969
so right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stage where</font>

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,910
the banking lover<font color="#E5E5E5"> from 7-8 years ago is</font>

23
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,400
much different from today but it still

24
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,500
works so security products and banking

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">malware both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are kept evolving so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,460
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go through what it looks like</font>

27
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:17,070
right now and won't focus too much on

28
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,399
the history so my talk will be divided

29
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,220
into five sections so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be going</font>

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">through the infection vectors the</font>

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,860
process of infection cnc communication

32
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,570
between the bots and the C&C servers and

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,509
then how the money<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually gets</font>

34
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:36,389
transferred and what we as a users can

35
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,619
do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent ourselves from being the</font>

36
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,200
victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this attack a couple of words</font>

37
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,689
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSIs</font>

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,039
one of the biggest security companies in

39
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:53,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">Denmark and here are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facts about</font>

40
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:55,380
CSIS I will not go too much into detail

41
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:57,000
with these either if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,770
more about Jesus you could contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,329
later or you can visit us as CSI SDK we

44
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,569
are also working with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font>

45
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,449
security agencies and some other

46
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:13,440
partners so here's a list of few of them

47
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so how the banking malware works</font>

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,030
the first step is how to infect people

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,769
so the goal of this step is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to infect as</font>

50
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,280
many people who have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bank accounts</font>

51
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:30,269
as possible and the most common method

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,370
that is used for this is femi<font color="#CCCCCC"> mills this</font>

53
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:34,530
is one method that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works the best and</font>

54
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that almost all</font>

55
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:41,730
companies use outlook or some similar

56
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,079
mail servers they have their own mail

57
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,599
servers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are not properly</font>

58
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:49,170
configured so usually you're you're more

59
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,358
likely to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass through the</font>

60
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,458
defenses on people's own mail servers

61
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:56,130
then for example on bigger mail servers

62
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,170
like Gmail or Yahoo and so on that's why

63
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">we see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the attacks go through</font>

64
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:06,179
people's business email addresses right

65
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:09,358
here is an example of a Stan email this

66
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">is from 23rd of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> August so it's fairly</font>

67
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:14,459
recent it was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the same day</font>

68
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:19,350
when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> making this presentation and</font>

69
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:21,600
we can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a small small</font>

70
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,850
file attached to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

71
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,920
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text and this is quite personalized</font>

72
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,500
it's a bit funny because they wrote

73
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,819
their d or e crime and the email address

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,010
that we have is a crime<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the name</font>

75
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> registered there is a crime so</font>

76
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">there would be you know using the name</font>

77
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:42,179
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> email and then the sender email</font>

78
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:46,078
is a legit looking fake email address

79
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,299
more most of the times and the text in

80
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,770
it is usually very brief which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

81
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,260
doesn't say much so it can

82
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:56,050
is the user to click on the attachment

83
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,940
and kind of see what's in it here's a

84
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,890
separate example of that it's from the

85
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,650
same spam run but we can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

86
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:05,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">name of the file is different from the</font>

87
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,620
previous one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's random characters</font>

88
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,210
and then the subject of the email is

89
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,530
different the text is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

90
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,570
and the person who is supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

91
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,510
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is also different this makes</font>

92
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:18,459
sure that all these campaigns don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

93
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,909
flagged so if they would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> using the</font>

94
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,490
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> file name it's more likely that you</font>

95
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,590
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody would block it or the same</font>

96
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,950
sender address and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they use</font>

97
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:32,229
different parameters to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of disguise</font>

98
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:34,270
the email second thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

99
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,500
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> botnets to send those emails so</font>

100
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,630
they're not coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the same IP</font>

101
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,030
address and hence it's not easy to block

102
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,530
them based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on an IP address and there</font>

103
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,820
are millions of spam emails being sent

104
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:48,010
every day so what actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the</font>

105
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,680
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the idea for them is for the</font>

106
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,270
user to<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on the attachment so</font>

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,310
inside the attachment we can see that

108
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a JavaScript</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> file so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

109
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,820
a dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> JS file is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to run in</font>

110
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">the browser but the user is supposed to</font>

111
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,310
double<font color="#E5E5E5"> click it once the user double</font>

112
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:07,000
clicks it then the malware starts to

113
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,950
work and if the javascript is just an

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">example from that day when I was looking</font>

115
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,260
there's they've been very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind</font>

116
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of files that we've seen that scr files</font>

117
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,360
they are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much similar to da txt</font>

118
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,460
files you could just basically change

119
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,060
the extension of eggs etude odyssey r &

120
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,460
goo still work wsf<font color="#E5E5E5"> are windows script</font>

121
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,230
files they're like VB script files and

122
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,180
then microsoft office files we've seen

123
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,540
quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them they're using macros</font>

124
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:37,180
in them so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you open a you know</font>

125
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,770
some file which looks like a word file

126
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,960
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a legit word file it</font>

127
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,520
opens in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft Word and once you</font>

128
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,049
open it up it says that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

129
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,849
need to enable your micros to see the

130
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,620
document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you enable them then the</font>

131
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,050
code executes which actually is

132
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,430
malicious code and we have seen also

133
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">text files but they are decreasing</font>

134
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:57,130
because there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> more and more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> male</font>

135
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,830
clients which actually just reject any

is contained in a zip file as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

139
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,950
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit declining but that did not</font>

140
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,730
stop the malware producers they just

00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,840
some other infection vectors the most

143
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,460
common one is fam email in this talk

144
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be focusing mostly on the most</font>

145
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,010
common stuff and won't go too much into

146
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,770
things which are there but they're not

147
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,969
the biggest threats so from the

148
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,979
infection vector point of view the

149
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,220
biggest threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any person is spam</font>

150
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:35,120
emails we at our company receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

151
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:39,320
50<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 100 the serious malware emails</font>

152
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:45,050
every day and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the case</font>

153
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:48,110
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> many other companies as well so</font>

154
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,450
we've seen a spam email email with a

155
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">malicious zip file there could also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

156
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,690
another option where there's actually a

157
00:06:52,580 --> 00:07:00,469
link and that link opens up a zip file

158
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,270
from some server and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also one</font>

159
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,280
option that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used extensively these</font>

160
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,620
days as well then there's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

161
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,809
called exploit kits the idea is a bit

162
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,330
older and in start there used to be

163
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,930
these exploit kits now it's a bit more

164
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:20,479
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar but the kid</font>

165
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:24,470
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it is reduced a bit so basically</font>

166
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,409
you heck<font color="#CCCCCC"> a legitimate website where the</font>

167
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,050
with the users visit and you infected

168
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:33,410
with the some malicious code and they're

169
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:40,250
basically exploiting some vulnerability

170
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:44,930
in the browser or in the some plugins

171
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:48,080
and so on and if a user visits the

172
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:50,270
website it gets infected and this is

173
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,620
much more critical problem because the

174
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,750
user doesn't really see that he gets

175
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,820
infected in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spam email the user</font>

176
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:59,510
actually has to click on the email and

177
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:01,219
so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the people who are you know</font>

178
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,380
aware of this kind of thing they're less

179
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,270
likely to do that but exploit kits are a

180
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,100
serious problem and anybody could be

181
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,140
could get infected but the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

182
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,270
that they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as common as the spam</font>

183
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,520
emails and they're used mostly in a

184
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,380
little targeted attacks but not

185
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,510
necessarily we have seen a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

186
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:20,180
ransomware being spread through them as

187
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,750
well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's also threat but not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> su</font>

188
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,270
just spam emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what's the</font>

189
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:31,099
objective of the first stage of malware

190
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:33,169
the file that we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

191
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:35,120
previous section a sip file with

192
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,728
JavaScript or any executable what is

193
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed to do so the first thing it</font>

194
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:44,120
does is it downloads another binary from

195
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:46,849
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> some some server and usually they</font>

196
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a couple of hard coded links</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

197
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">four we've also seen and it tries to</font>

198
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,510
download the loader from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those so</font>

199
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,420
if the loader it manages to download it

200
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,920
you know fair enough if it can't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

201
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,300
then it will try the second URL and

202
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,390
third URL and so on and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

203
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:08,959
file that it downloads is not a normal

204
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,000
executable it is rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> some howdy it</font>

205
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,800
needs some kind of decoding so that's

206
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the responsibility of this first</font>

207
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,329
aid malware and because of this very

208
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:20,150
limited functionality it is usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

209
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:26,060
small in size we're seeing 10k B's 15k

210
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:28,459
B's mostly and because of simple

211
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,859
functionality they can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> create a new</font>

212
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:32,510
one real fast so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if all their CNC</font>

213
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,820
servers from where they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> serving</font>

214
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:37,490
these Mel word they get blocked they

215
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,800
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> just create a few new servers and</font>

216
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,500
you know start sending new spam emails

217
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,790
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new links so they try and keep</font>

218
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:49,820
it simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right the second part is</font>

219
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:55,280
the infection process so in this stage

220
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:57,980
the loader or the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> stage malware</font>

221
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,569
when it it is already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the system it</font>

222
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,300
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> infect the system and there are</font>

223
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,830
a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it wants to do their</font>

224
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,079
main objective is that it should be

225
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty hard to detect that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the system is</font>

226
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,150
actually infected once it's infected

227
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,480
secondly it should be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

228
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:15,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate with its CNC servers</font>

229
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,480
and thirdly it should be able to survive

230
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,610
the reboot because most of these this

231
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,680
malware runs in memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you shut</font>

232
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,240
the computer down it stops working so

233
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,069
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when when</font>

234
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,410
when you restart the computer it's still

235
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:35,589
up right so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an infection change</font>

236
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:38,860
a chain of a malware called pandas use

237
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:43,510
it's fairly recent this one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

238
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:49,420
week or so so in there we can see that a

239
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:50,889
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of steps are taken so the first</font>

240
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,810
one I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if it's visible from</font>

241
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:55,180
behind i'll speak it speak so the first

242
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:58,119
line that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see in this chain is</font>

243
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,790
it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> panna XZ it's the malware</font>

244
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,250
itself and I've named it<font color="#E5E5E5"> paint at panda</font>

245
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,620
at exit usually they're random<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

246
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">names so what it does is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

247
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:14,740
downloads another component from the

248
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:16,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so the panda that XD</font>

249
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,949
file in this case would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be called the</font>

250
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,779
loader so we have the first stage then

251
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:21,880
we had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> loader and then the loader</font>

252
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:26,529
downloads the payload so there's usually

253
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,790
three malware executables being used

254
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:30,220
these days there there can be more or

255
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">less but that's what's being used mostly</font>

256
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,620
these days and this payload once it's

257
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,069
downloaded it's executed so this is a

258
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,889
precious property they don't want to

259
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:43,990
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know public so much and it</font>

260
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:48,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">only downloads once everything up till</font>

261
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:50,649
now works so and you can basically

262
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:53,589
create signatures and so on of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font>

263
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:56,920
that's why they use some kind of caution

264
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:58,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">and download payload only on the</font>

265
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,729
machines that they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> confident</font>

266
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:03,279
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can affect so once the payload</font>

267
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,459
execute it also doesn't execute as a

268
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">process which normally all programs in</font>

269
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:11,739
windows do it tries to inject itself

270
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,459
into some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate processes</font>

271
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:18,850
and we can see in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> at inject</font>

272
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:21,130
itself into svchost.exe processes which

273
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,480
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already running on the windows there</font>

274
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,750
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a bunch of those so they are</font>

275
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,040
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because you</font>

276
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,360
can actually create a few more and

277
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,319
nobody would notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

278
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:34,190
something weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the last step</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

279
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:38,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one is a cmd.exe being run and this</font>

280
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:40,910
is usually a batch script and if job is

281
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,699
to delete all the executables that are

282
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,680
on the system up till now so this kind

283
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,930
of thing that people notice when they

284
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,640
infect themselves with malware is after

285
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,290
they double click the malware it's you

286
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">know goes away and they don't see</font>

287
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,260
anything happening so they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

288
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,090
know maybe it was some broken program

289
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,670
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens some of the</font>

290
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,650
melvar actually also used the fact this

291
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,959
that do kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fool people they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

292
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,420
show you know message that this program

293
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">is broken try again so this but the</font>

294
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:13,490
malware is actually executed already now

295
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:20,120
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about injection</font>

296
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:22,940
why is this used so the first benefited

297
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,200
has that it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the malware</font>

298
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,120
doesn't show up in the list of processes

299
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,260
so if you open up the task manager on

300
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,570
your computer you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

301
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,800
processes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are being run and if</font>

302
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,720
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a weird one maybe somebody</font>

303
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">would notice so but if you inject it and</font>

304
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:39,050
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it processes it is very</font>

305
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,660
difficult to detect it's also difficult

306
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,939
for most of the antivirus is to detect

307
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,130
because the most of them actually don't

308
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,050
detect stuff in the memory some of them

309
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:52,610
do but most<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't the second thing is</font>

310
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,319
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also very difficult to kill it</font>

311
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,500
so to kill it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to kill the</font>

312
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual legit process and one of the most</font>

313
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,540
used processes explorer.exe and

314
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,220
everything in the windows all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user</font>

315
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,890
interaction stuff actually goes through

316
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:10,130
the explorer EXE so if you kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

317
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,990
you know computer stops working so most

318
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,240
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the times it's it's very safe bet to</font>

319
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,490
inject into explore that eggsy another

320
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that it has is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you try</font>

321
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:22,040
and debug explore that<font color="#E5E5E5"> eggsy you try to</font>

322
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,319
pause<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the code is doing</font>

323
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,969
you actually your computer you can't use

324
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,860
it you know as much as you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

325
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font>

326
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,480
use in case of some other process so it

327
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,150
makes it more difficult for users to

328
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,660
disinfect themselves it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult for</font>

329
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:41,230
security researchers so that's what's

330
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:43,329
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used mostly we've also used seen</font>

331
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,170
for example internet explorer EXE chrome

332
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:50,110
and so on and after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the injection the</font>

333
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:53,349
loader deletes the the first stage

334
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,420
malware the loader itself and also the

335
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,000
payload from the hard disk and they copy

336
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,099
the payload to temp folder usually or

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,810
some other temporary location where from

338
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:06,100
where they can restart it in case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

339
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:07,599
computer restart now the second thing or

340
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,480
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the persistence</font>

341
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,440
persistence is basically to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

342
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:19,450
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> the malware once your computer</font>

343
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:22,450
restarts so yeah the thing we see mostly

344
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:26,140
is the temp folder is where the binary

345
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:30,400
sits and run keys what points to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we</font>

346
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:34,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see an example in here this is a</font>

347
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:39,880
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of never quest we can see</font>

348
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:42,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">this the binary is stored in C users</font>

349
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,100
username appdata local and then there

350
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,590
there's a random file folder<font color="#E5E5E5"> name and</font>

351
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,270
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> filing so this also makes the</font>

352
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,740
detection a bit harder as the folder

353
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,210
name is random file name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is random it</font>

354
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,680
will be random on all computer so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

355
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,260
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a signature of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the file name</font>

356
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,280
it because it's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> on all the</font>

357
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:04,060
machines and this will get executed upon

358
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:07,480
the computer restart we've seen more

359
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,989
trickier methods of persistence because

360
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,490
the persistence is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the single-most how</font>

361
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,960
to say the bottleneck place where you

362
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,870
can actually see if you're infected or

363
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:20,080
not because<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the malware has to rerun</font>

364
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,850
when the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> restarts so they try</font>

365
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,590
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use some kind of persistence method</font>

366
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,200
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not many there are not many</font>

367
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:29,110
options<font color="#E5E5E5"> so run keys are generally</font>

368
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,670
generally just<font color="#CCCCCC"> two there's a local</font>

369
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,170
machine run key and there's a local user

370
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,180
run key and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just see them in two</font>

371
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,410
minutes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a</font>

372
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:40,519
malware so too

373
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:42,920
stop that we have seen for example

374
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,420
schedule tasks they do the same thing

375
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,420
you can make a scheduled task which is a

376
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,459
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of windows by default and that</font>

377
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,529
scheduled task will restart the whatever

378
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:54,079
you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever time you can set a</font>

379
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:56,810
time or you can set reboot and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

380
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,420
some malware are using that and then

381
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,579
there is malware which is which can be

382
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,469
run as a service so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have services in</font>

383
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:05,119
in windows and there are background

384
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,069
processes that keep running all the time

385
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,069
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can register your malware as</font>

386
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,510
a service this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very difficult to for</font>

387
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:16,908
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to detect because nobody actually</font>

388
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:18,559
looks at services most of the cases and

389
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:22,520
then there's one very interesting one

390
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,319
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is used by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three decks it was used</font>

391
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,658
in the past now they've switched to a

392
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:31,129
different mechanism what they did was

393
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:34,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">they hoped the shutdown function of the</font>

394
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,320
computer so when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are infected with</font>

395
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:40,340
grid X and you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and shut down or</font>

396
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:44,418
restart the malware would get a trigger

397
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:46,280
for that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would drop the malware</font>

398
00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:48,620
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> memory under the hardest and</font>

399
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,809
create a run key pointing to that and

400
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,209
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before the shutdown</font>

401
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,940
so you can't really see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it after it</font>

402
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,220
actually happens and when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer</font>

403
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,860
shuts down boots up so there's already a

404
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,470
run key there is a file on the system it

405
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:05,178
would open that file using the run key

406
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,650
and execute the malware as soon as the

407
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:10,309
malware starts executing it deletes

408
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,870
again the run key and the file so while

409
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,980
the malware is running there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is nothing</font>

410
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,260
on the hard disk at all there is no

411
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,870
registry key pointing to the malware

412
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,850
there's no malware itself on the system

413
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:22,129
this was very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this had a big</font>

414
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:24,320
drawback that if you actually hard reset

415
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,480
your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a computer gets</font>

416
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,428
disinfected because it can't restart

417
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,780
itself so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess they were having</font>

418
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:35,510
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that so they switch to</font>

419
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:37,580
schedule tests alright the next thing

420
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:41,030
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about is CNC</font>

421
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:44,418
communication so all the malware banking

422
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:48,168
malware has to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the CNC</font>

423
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:50,749
very critical because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in today's world</font>

424
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:52,009
things are changing real fast security

425
00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:55,639
companies are really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

426
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:57,139
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be blocking stuff very fast so</font>

427
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,238
in order to stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead of them they need</font>

428
00:18:57,139 --> 00:19:00,859
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to communicate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

429
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:04,909
people that they've infected and use

430
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:08,449
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> leverage to give the new</font>

431
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:10,820
instructions to update their binary to

432
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:14,720
update whatever information they have in

433
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:19,428
there and this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the very</font>

434
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:26,450
important factors of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware itself</font>

435
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:28,070
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it requires some some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk art so in</font>

436
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,450
the previous two sections we've seen how

437
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:34,668
the people get the malware in itself and

438
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:39,139
how the infection gets completed once

439
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:41,179
the malware is running as a as a thread

440
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:43,488
in some kind of legit windows process

441
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:46,759
and there's a wafer to persist it's

442
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:49,669
pretty solid<font color="#E5E5E5"> so after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them</font>

443
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:54,350
actually try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check in with their C&C</font>

444
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:56,659
server and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that they</font>

445
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to tell the C&C server that I have</font>

446
00:19:56,659 --> 00:20:01,489
managed to infect one of the guys and

447
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,129
they upload some information and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

448
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:06,739
information actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually goes into a</font>

449
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:08,119
database which criminals can see so they

450
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:09,499
have these beautiful charts where they

451
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,029
can see that they've infected this many

452
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,309
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this part this part of the</font>

453
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:15,109
world and this much of them are using

454
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:19,700
Windows XP and this much are using this

455
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:22,609
and there are also external ip's that

456
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,710
that are sent to them and then there's

457
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:26,119
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thing called bought ID which is</font>

458
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,090
send there's a bad idea is basically

459
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:33,499
unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifier identifying about it</font>

460
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:35,809
is usually generated based on certain

461
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:38,450
features of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system so for example</font>

462
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:40,820
the name of the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one factor</font>

463
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:43,519
the installation<font color="#CCCCCC"> date is one factor and</font>

464
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,249
so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there they will basically just</font>

465
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,340
hash it or use some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of algorithm to</font>

466
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:51,830
generate a unique ID on that and that is

467
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually used in communication quite up</font>

468
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:56,340
and in some cases we've also seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

469
00:20:55,099 --> 00:21:01,950
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of apps</font>

470
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:05,370
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this has to actually to</font>

471
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:08,490
actually how to say purposes the first

472
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:11,489
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it it helps them to find the</font>

473
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:13,049
security researchers because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if i have a</font>

474
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,730
virtual machine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm running</font>

475
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">melbourne it i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have some tools</font>

476
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that help me analyze the melvar so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I for</font>

477
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have our shower i'll have some</font>

478
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:25,469
kind of a debugger<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll have fiddler or</font>

479
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:28,529
process explorer and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

480
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:30,000
if they see this this stuff they can

481
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:31,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify that this is give you</font>

482
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,240
researchers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can you know do</font>

483
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:35,010
the opposite research to see what

484
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,010
security researchers are using these

485
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,960
days and then they can use that improve

486
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,720
their malware to block what they're

487
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,820
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on the other functionality</font>

488
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it is that sometimes they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> manage to</font>

489
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,428
to get a jackpot by infecting some of

490
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,439
the very critical systems for example

491
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:55,770
bank's internal systems or some other

492
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,110
systems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are using some special apps</font>

493
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,299
for example bank's internal software or

494
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:05,070
some libraries with some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

495
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:06,990
so in that case they have this option to

496
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:11,730
do further investigation on that a

497
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:14,190
manual level this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real message</font>

498
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:15,929
check-in message from droid x this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

499
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,289
the decrypted form it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

500
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:21,690
encrypted in several layers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll get to</font>

501
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:23,730
that shortly and in this we can see that

502
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first thing is unique which is</font>

503
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,990
actually the pod ID so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one hash</font>

504
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,570
that they generated the first part is

505
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually the name of the computer and</font>

506
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:34,110
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a hash based on</font>

507
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,149
installation date and so on the second

508
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,309
is botnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have several botnets so</font>

509
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:40,559
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep them separated so the</font>

510
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:42,330
client actually tells the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CNC bitch but</font>

511
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Madame I want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to so in this case</font>

512
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:47,520
it's 220 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

513
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,740
system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some internal thing for</font>

514
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,950
for the malware which<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're using to</font>

515
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,390
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> track of what rich version people</font>

516
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,460
are using so they can update them with

517
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,799
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest version and they have these</font>

518
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,480
backward compatibility and stuff so the

519
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,549
older<font color="#CCCCCC"> version of malware has lower</font>

520
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,470
functionalities as they keep adding

521
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:06,690
things to keep improving so they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

522
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:08,380
keep a track of this and then there's a

523
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,690
type called bot there's another

524
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,280
type in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case which is node I will</font>

525
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:15,520
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into details on that because that</font>

526
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be a bit long and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's the</font>

527
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,750
IP which is usually the external IP at

528
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,879
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not the internal IP 192</font>

529
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,520
168 kind but it is the external one and

530
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,520
they are using certain services to get

531
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,930
that for example there are certain

532
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,420
websites that you can visit and they

533
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,580
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you the your external IP so</font>

534
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,200
they use one of those and then they send

535
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:39,460
external IP so these are very good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

536
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,970
identify serious breaches for example if

537
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,010
you manage to infect you know some

538
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,800
security agency of some country they

539
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually have unique IPS registered to</font>

540
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,639
them so this is used for that also they

541
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,709
can plot nice graphs based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

542
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,660
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> which part of the world they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

543
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,220
hitting and you know so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

544
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,710
there's this public key which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is used</font>

545
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,340
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> communication by the C&C server to</font>

546
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:05,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bot so I'll shortly explain it a bit</font>

547
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:08,409
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yeah this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

548
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the keys generated by the bot and it is</font>

549
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,460
sent to the C&C server so whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> CNC</font>

550
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,620
server sends to the bot later will be

551
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypted with this public</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key so only</font>

552
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,310
this part can decrypt<font color="#CCCCCC"> it anybody in the</font>

553
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:21,909
middle is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do that because of</font>

554
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:26,409
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way asymmetric cryptography works</font>

555
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:29,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right the second thing in here is</font>

556
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the configuration so configuration is</font>

557
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,830
basically a set of settings or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of</font>

558
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,040
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the malware can do and these</font>

559
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,470
configurations are the parameters to

560
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,540
those functionality so what banking

561
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:46,900
malware can do for example let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it</font>

562
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,879
can attack certain banks and steal money

563
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,770
from them so what are those banks that's

564
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,180
what the configuration will say so they

565
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,340
will they can update this configuration

566
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,530
with more<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank names for example how</font>

567
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,330
they attack those banks there they have

568
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:02,410
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called HTTP injects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll also</font>

569
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:04,270
explain that a bit in the shortly so

570
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,890
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sending new stp injects and</font>

571
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,570
the bank keeps updating their websites a

572
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,030
certain inject<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped working after a</font>

573
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,530
while and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they will have more</font>

574
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:16,730
injects or updated versions of them so

575
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:21,110
CNT servers there's usually a list of

576
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:29,480
them in all the the malware payloads so

577
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:31,310
the the list actually is dynamic it's

578
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,470
not a static one and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

579
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:36,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that security people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

580
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,960
this on the on these malware so they

581
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,250
identified these<font color="#CCCCCC"> C&C servers they talked</font>

582
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,680
to the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are running them and</font>

583
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,480
the companies who are hosting them so

584
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,820
they keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking them down so they need</font>

585
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,340
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a steady flow of new C&C servers</font>

586
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,340
in order to keep their about networking

587
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,770
so even if one of the C&C servers is

588
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,419
working it should be able to send the

589
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,250
new ones to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bots and the button it</font>

590
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,740
keeps a life that is why it's extremely

591
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,890
hard to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> down these banking malware</font>

592
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,170
botnets because you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take down</font>

593
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,690
all CNC servers at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time and</font>

594
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,030
they are quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them usually 34</font>

595
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,920
via is pretty normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're in</font>

596
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,990
diverse geographical locations where

597
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,610
different police works different

598
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,200
countries have different laws and so on

599
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,179
sometimes not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to do that and</font>

600
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what they're exploiting and</font>

601
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,040
that's why it's almost impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

602
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,840
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> down a really good botnet unless</font>

603
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,090
you can somehow hack it in a way that

604
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,919
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack it from inside but by</font>

605
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:32,780
shutting down<font color="#CCCCCC"> C&C</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers it's extremely</font>

606
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,430
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there are other</font>

607
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:37,730
configurations depending on the malware

608
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:40,820
and what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> functionality is so here's a</font>

609
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,170
real configuration from 3x it's a small

610
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:45,290
snippet of it it's not all of it it's

611
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,600
usually 400 500 lines long and pretty

612
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:52,280
big so in this case it's in the nice

613
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,719
format of XML and pretty easy to read in

614
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,580
the first section in the first line

615
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,400
there is a hash which uniquely

616
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,889
identifies this convict so the bot can

617
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,500
you know ask for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated one and if</font>

618
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,000
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets an updated one how do we know</font>

619
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,110
how does it know it's updated or not

620
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,130
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this hash so if it has</font>

621
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:13,010
different hash they usually can use that

622
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:15,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next is the URL so this is</font>

623
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,510
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a URL which shows which bank to</font>

624
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:20,570
attack and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a regular</font>

625
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:23,070
expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> which particularly targets</font>

626
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:29,009
certain bank in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case it's</font>

627
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:30,779
one bank and it has a two URLs so it is

628
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:34,559
using a regular expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover both</font>

629
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,840
them and there's another section down

630
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,580
there it's called form grabber so what

631
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,570
this part of the malware does is

632
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:45,840
actually is able to grab the form so if

633
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,460
if you fill up a form for example use

634
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,189
your username and<font color="#CCCCCC"> password in equally</font>

635
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,960
click Submit this is this part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

636
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,450
malware is able to get whatever you

637
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,429
entered in that form it could be more

638
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">than username password or and so on in</font>

639
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:59,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube in case in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case it would</font>

640
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,229
most probably be the username password

641
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,000
and then they have your username

642
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,100
password and this is quite useful for

643
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,190
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of purposes they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using that</font>

644
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">in their huge ecosystem so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is one</font>

645
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,240
example they are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of</font>

646
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,730
credentials that they can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they</font>

647
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">are using those for further infections</font>

648
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:22,620
and other purposes and here is an HTTP

649
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:24,360
inject so how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that work this is</font>

650
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,039
actually the main feature of banking

651
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:31,889
malware and the reason why it's so

652
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:33,210
successful so if you have a browser and

653
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:35,519
you visit a website what actually

654
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:37,289
happens you make a request request goes

655
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,389
to some server and server responds with

656
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:41,250
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then whatever</font>

657
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:42,959
functionality takes place in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server</font>

658
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,110
stays in the server in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end but the</font>

659
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,570
user gets is some kind of HTML code so

660
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,209
if you can change that code in the

661
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,220
browser the user<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

662
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">want it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see and it has it doesn't</font>

663
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,419
have anything to do with the server so

664
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:59,699
for example let me give an example let's

665
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:02,129
say you visit your bank site and it says

666
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,799
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have five hundred dollars in</font>

667
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:07,110
your account and if I am in the browser

668
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,480
and I can change the HTML code<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

669
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,610
change that 500 do for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 and</font>

670
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,889
you will see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5,000 but it</font>

671
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:15,629
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not true and this is the</font>

672
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:16,918
main feature that banking malware has

673
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:19,179
and they are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to steal</font>

674
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:23,470
people's money I will get to how do they

675
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:25,330
we do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a few minutes so in this</font>

676
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:30,730
particular case what it does is that it

677
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:32,830
finds a pattern which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> C data and then</font>

678
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,630
form<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and then it replaces that</font>

679
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,340
pattern with the one that we see below

680
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:41,350
and it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> a JavaScript that</font>

681
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:43,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">injects into the page so this JavaScript</font>

682
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,699
gets injected into the browser off the

683
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,990
victim and it is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> not on the CNC</font>

684
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,660
server it doesn't affect the other

685
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:51,100
people visiting their website is just on

686
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:55,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser of that particular person</font>

687
00:29:51,100 --> 00:30:01,480
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some additional modules</font>

688
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:04,180
this is actually used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for various</font>

689
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,860
purposes and since it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> police you</font>

690
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:07,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">know working system they can just</font>

691
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,580
download whatever they want so for

692
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:11,500
example VNC is a very common thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

693
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,590
something like teamviewer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Orion see we</font>

694
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,570
probably or no or remote desktop so you

695
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,429
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically control people's computer</font>

696
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,960
using that so once somebody is infected

697
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,400
you can log into their machine as a

698
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">criminal and do whatever you want in</font>

699
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,440
there there's the key logging modules

700
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,080
which will log people's keys there's

701
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:33,610
process members scanning very good for

702
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:35,139
point of sale devices so you can

703
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:37,510
basically scan their memory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

704
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:40,090
everybody's credit card with done some

705
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,680
shopping did that day and it's also used

706
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,030
for for identification of critical

707
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:46,750
systems for example if you manage to

708
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:49,240
infect a bank some you know some

709
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:53,200
employee of the bank you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more</font>

710
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,760
research on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on there</font>

711
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,760
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many more modules and depending on</font>

712
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:01,930
the malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're used if the</font>

713
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:05,890
necessary encryption is a pretty

714
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:08,050
interesting and very important for

715
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:10,180
malware to work correctly because all

716
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:12,190
the stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw the check-in and</font>

717
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,320
so on they can be easily identified on

718
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:17,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network and if you have a network</font>

719
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,210
device that scans your users you can

720
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily see who is impacted by you know</font>

721
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,890
looking for those keywords so they all

722
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,939
use

723
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,460
scription pretty much all of them and

724
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,190
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually strong encryption however</font>

725
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,350
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them using a</font>

726
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,770
custom encryption and why they do that

727
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:37,320
it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have to right tools</font>

728
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,610
manually to break them for the standard

729
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,540
encryption there are already tools

730
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:44,820
available and it's easier to break it

731
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,260
compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the custom one so custom one</font>

732
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,870
you have to debug the code and go

733
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,730
through all four I don't know a few days

734
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:52,679
or a few weeks and then you can

735
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,300
basically get what they're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

736
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,740
takes time and slows to researchers down

737
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,399
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very good for them because they</font>

738
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:00,960
need time and time is money because they

739
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,550
have more time to transfer money

740
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,910
together before the security people

741
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:07,409
catch up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are hybrid and hybrid</font>

742
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:08,490
and layered encryption which is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

743
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,260
encrypt something and then the output

744
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypt it further</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than the output</font>

745
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,160
encrypted further and so on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

746
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of duty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X encryption scheme</font>

747
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:21,150
which is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

748
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:25,290
banking malware so the conflict that we

749
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:26,670
we've seen a little while ago is one of

750
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:29,610
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical things that they want</font>

751
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:33,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hide so when a server sends a</font>

752
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:35,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">conflict file to the to the bot it</font>

753
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,010
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> encrypts it with it with some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

754
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,930
or encryption scheme this is fairly

755
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:42,120
trivial you have a few bites and then

756
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:45,930
you XOR all the bites with those bites

757
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:50,639
and it's quite easy to correct even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

758
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:52,140
you don't know the key and then but they

759
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,830
don't stop there so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> output of that</font>

760
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:58,260
they encrypt it with the rc4 which is a

761
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,389
symmetric key cryptography and the key

762
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,400
for our<font color="#E5E5E5"> c4 they encrypt it with the</font>

763
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:05,490
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> key that we saw while ago in the</font>

764
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,500
check-in message so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes it</font>

765
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,090
extremely solid already and then they

766
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:11,820
have a third step on top of it they

767
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:14,639
encapsulate all that in standard TLS

768
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:18,510
which is standard encryption scheme that

769
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:22,070
everybody uses so TLS is easy to break

770
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,070
because there are already men the middle

771
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,870
tools that can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

772
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,600
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the endpoints you can easily</font>

773
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:30,399
break that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not possible if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

774
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,809
don't control<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of the endpoints but</font>

775
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,090
yeah once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that then you have to</font>

776
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,740
break all this further encryption and

777
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,149
you know the most difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is to</font>

778
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,950
know what they are actually using and

779
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:40,389
then once you know then you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

780
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,919
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it takes time for people</font>

781
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:45,820
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're doing</font>

782
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:49,000
and that's the time delaying tactic that

783
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:51,010
that is used<font color="#CCCCCC"> without all right so now</font>

784
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,750
we're gonna move on to how the banking

785
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,539
malware actually works in terms of

786
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,490
stealing money the money transfers I'll

787
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:59,679
quickly go through the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

788
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,200
things so the first one is stealing

789
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,529
credentials part we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen already</font>

790
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">form grabber feature so the mail will</font>

791
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:09,219
inject itself into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser and then</font>

792
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:10,960
it can see the stuff that's being sent

793
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:13,149
in the browser for example in the forums

794
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,339
or through the post requests which are

795
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:18,909
what is used on on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backend for</font>

796
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:20,770
sending data from the browser to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the C&C</font>

797
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:22,750
server so they can hook that and you

798
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,369
know extract that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the</font>

799
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,750
unencrypted form and there are many

800
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:27,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">banks in the world who actually don't</font>

801
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the two-factor authentication so if</font>

802
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,000
you actually have those credentials you

803
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,310
can just transfer money and that's

804
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,699
what's used by some banking malware it

805
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,379
was used by de risa a while ago then

806
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:41,290
they switch to a different method which

807
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:42,639
we'll get to shortly and the second

808
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:45,250
method which is a bit more complicated

809
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,099
or at least requires a bit more effort

810
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,280
is redirect method yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should mention</font>

811
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:54,399
here is that once<font color="#CCCCCC"> the credentials are</font>

812
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,129
stolen they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

813
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,529
bank from their own machine because that

814
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:01,180
would flag their IP and also the banks

815
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:04,089
have this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they monitor their</font>

816
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,220
users and have their<font color="#CCCCCC"> ips logged in so if</font>

817
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:07,930
you log in from a different IP suddenly

818
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,089
like for example i live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> denmark and I</font>

819
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,310
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> here if my account suddenly</font>

820
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:14,290
gets logged in from Cuba most<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely the</font>

821
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,210
bank will block it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in order to stop</font>

822
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:19,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">these kind of problems they use the VNC</font>

823
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,130
module that we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

824
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">while ago and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> login</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the victims</font>

825
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,339
machine and use the victims browser to

826
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:27,880
login to their

827
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:29,140
bank account and transfer money so this

828
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,150
way it pretty hard for bank who actually

829
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:34,900
know if it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> criminal or the guy</font>

830
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:37,029
just insulted the redirect method in

831
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,509
this case what the banking malware does

832
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:43,839
is they create a whole replica of the

833
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:47,049
bank site and this replica is hosted on

834
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:48,489
one of their own servers the reason it

835
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:50,229
works pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much similar to the fishing</font>

836
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:53,319
but the difference is that the user do

837
00:35:50,229 --> 00:35:55,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">not see the URL that where it is</font>

838
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,499
actually hosted since they're injected

839
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:58,239
they have injected into<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser they can</font>

840
00:35:56,499 --> 00:36:00,218
just change<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so you see the actual</font>

841
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,079
URL of the bank the the fact that

842
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:04,749
there's this green lock in the corner

843
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,190
it's still there so the user has<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea</font>

844
00:36:04,749 --> 00:36:08,890
that is actually on a fake website and

845
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,059
there you can enter credentials they

846
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,700
both course get the credentials because

847
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:13,869
it's their own site they can also do the

848
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,029
men<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle by using those</font>

849
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:18,489
credentials to<font color="#CCCCCC"> log into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the real bank</font>

850
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:19,749
and then if the bank asks or something

851
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:23,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">like two factor auth they can just</font>

852
00:36:19,749 --> 00:36:25,029
create a new page in there and ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

853
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:27,249
the user to give it to that so they're

854
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:28,630
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of collaborating with the user by</font>

855
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:30,038
tricking them into giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all the</font>

856
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:31,630
information they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> and since they</font>

857
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:34,599
controlled all the website they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font>

858
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,190
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty fast this method is used by</font>

859
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,219
droid x it's also used by breweries in

860
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:41,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past and yeah it's responsible for a</font>

861
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:45,039
lot of losses the next thing is

862
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,849
automated transfer system this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a one</font>

863
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,739
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fascinating</font>

864
00:36:48,849 --> 00:36:54,519
because it's it works fully<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam</font>

865
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:56,650
automatically and since although

866
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,930
criminals have these call centers and so

867
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,960
on they have quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of step but if</font>

868
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,979
you know somebody can use this it's of

869
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">course better for them because it's</font>

870
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:08,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">fully automatic so the way it works is</font>

871
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:12,999
that as we have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know inject</font>

872
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,759
things a while ago the users when the

873
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:20,069
user logs into the bank side there's

874
00:37:15,759 --> 00:37:20,069
already code injected into into that and

875
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,339
the that code knows that the user is

876
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually on the for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transfer</font>

877
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:31,920
pager or it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just past the login page</font>

878
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:33,210
and then they can use for example since

879
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,559
it's a code running inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser</font>

880
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,789
they can do stuff there so for example

881
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,099
what they can do is that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

882
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:40,559
contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> their C&C server from within the</font>

883
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:42,690
browser that okay this guy's already

884
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,000
logged in you should send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me an account</font>

885
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,400
number from to which I can transfer the

886
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,869
money from here so once they have the

887
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:56,520
account number they could just ask the

888
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:57,869
user by for the two factor auth code by

889
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,579
tricking them so one thing that we've

890
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:01,799
seen in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an EverQuest which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

891
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:03,809
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank malware is that they say</font>

892
00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:06,869
that you have received<font color="#E5E5E5"> some money so in</font>

893
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:08,670
order to you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get that money</font>

894
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,920
in your account you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to enter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

895
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:13,200
two factor auth code so when the user

896
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">enters that two factor auth code that</font>

897
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,319
ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> goat is actually used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer</font>

898
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,420
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of his account rather than</font>

899
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:20,279
giving him money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they can of course</font>

900
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,930
show it that he actually received money

901
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,520
rather than lost because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

902
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:26,399
the browser and by the time the user

903
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">triggered out it's already too late and</font>

904
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,450
yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is used by never crossed for</font>

905
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:33,450
example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> been used with by other</font>

906
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:36,450
malware as well in the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

907
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:40,078
since we've talked about most of the

908
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:41,970
things so far how it actually works from

909
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,690
start to end so what we can do actually

910
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:47,520
to protect ourselves there are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font>

911
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:50,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tips the most important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

912
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,788
once you receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> emails be very vigilant</font>

913
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,440
about them do not click on links in the

914
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:57,359
emails or open attachments unless you're

915
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,900
expecting them this is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the most</font>

916
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">straightforward rule and will help quite</font>

917
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:06,420
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> because most of the attacks we see</font>

918
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:10,319
comes through spam emails this is by<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

919
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:13,020
the most useful way to not get infected

920
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:14,970
second thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show file</font>

921
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,859
extensions because we've seen different

922
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,720
malware that have a different extension

923
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:21,779
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> malware which is eggs</font>

924
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,578
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> work but it actually shows the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ICN</font>

925
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:25,349
of a PDF file so the user doesn't know

926
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if it's a PDF or not because by</font>

927
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:28,770
default the extensions that are

928
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,180
extensions that are hidden so he would

929
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,859
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PDF file and he's more</font>

930
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,899
likely to click it so

931
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:38,130
have the extensions shown so you could

932
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,690
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually is and another</font>

933
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that I mentioned is the startup is</font>

934
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:44,700
one of the easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> way is to find</font>

935
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,319
malware so check your startup from time

936
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:51,328
to time to make sure that there is no

937
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:52,950
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no weird program in there that</font>

938
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:55,589
you did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not install and anything that</font>

939
00:39:52,950 --> 00:40:00,058
you did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not install</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just remove from</font>

940
00:39:55,589 --> 00:40:02,369
time to time and network traffic

941
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:04,079
monitoring is also a good thing it's a

942
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:06,450
little hard to do on your own computer

943
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,099
because of all the encryption and so on

944
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:12,569
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> with wireshark you get the</font>

945
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:17,039
traffic which is already encrypted if it

946
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:18,720
is if it it is encrypted also you can

947
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">use for example fiddler but for that you</font>

948
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,209
need to make these certificates install

949
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:26,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">these root certificates which is in</font>

950
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:29,910
itself a security problem but you can

951
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,160
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at a company network level so</font>

952
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:36,029
there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can monitor the traffic and</font>

953
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,980
have a contract with one of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> CNC</font>

954
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:39,539
server providers so you have the latest

955
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,950
C&C servers and if anybody's can be

956
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:44,069
getting them you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

957
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,629
figure them out and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also check</font>

958
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:47,609
if any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the your legit vintage windows</font>

959
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,759
processes are injected<font color="#CCCCCC"> into and there</font>

960
00:40:47,609 --> 00:40:52,589
are some tools to to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

961
00:40:50,759 --> 00:40:53,940
you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will</font>

962
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:55,589
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the processes and the one</font>

963
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,259
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are injected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into they will be</font>

964
00:40:55,589 --> 00:41:02,670
flagged as red so that's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

965
00:40:58,259 --> 00:41:06,329
good and another very good thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

966
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:10,049
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful is to use the mobile</font>

967
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:12,480
banking apps to check your bank account

968
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:14,740
balance regularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> there most of the</font>

969
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">banks provide one day</font>

970
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,790
kind of alerts where you get a daily

971
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:20,020
alert of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money you have and you</font>

00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,940
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> since you know you how much you</font>

973
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,890
spend and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much more money</font>

974
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,170
you're expecting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you know using</font>

975
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> method figure out the problem very</font>

976
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,050
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you can figure it out you</font>

977
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,400
can talk to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank's most of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> banks</font>

978
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:34,750
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure your money so if you</font>

979
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,690
lost the money because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of some malware</font>

980
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:39,340
and so on they will reimburse it but for

981
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:42,100
them to reimburse it you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell</font>

982
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,990
them as fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and you need to</font>

983
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:47,170
provide them some kind of documentation

984
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:51,310
so on that this was of course malicious

985
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:54,369
attack and that's all that I have in

986
00:41:51,310 --> 00:42:20,890
terms of what I'm going to say so

987
00:41:54,369 --> 00:42:22,400
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> sign thank you need different</font>

size

989
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:48,770
you mean the name ID yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

990
00:42:47,089 --> 00:42:50,359
serious bottleneck and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen a lot</font>

991
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">of problems with it in Denmark because</font>

992
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,619
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and you can use it</font>

995
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:03,740
the URL which from where that<font color="#E5E5E5"> applet is</font>

996
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,720
actually loaded you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that in the</font>

997
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,220
browser by<font color="#E5E5E5"> right clicking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their applet</font>

998
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,660
and clicking inspect so you can see

999
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,660
where it's actually communicating it and

1000
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,578
there's a one legit place where there's

1001
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,078
actually this applet is coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1002
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:16,880
then all the fake ones are of course

1003
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:18,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">vague so this can be used but of course</font>

1004
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,630
for for an average user this is a

1005
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:22,160
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's a lot of MIT fishing</font>

1006
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:28,069
going on the other thing that is a

1007
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:29,450
useful is to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of yeah you since I</font>

1008
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:31,130
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of phishing sites it's pretty</font>

1009
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,480
easy to identify them because of their

1010
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,730
there's some problem with that but I

1011
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,160
understand that it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that</font>

1012
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:38,839
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an average user but for us I</font>

1013
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,640
think we can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> check the URL where</font>

1014
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,359
the applet is being loaded from and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1015
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,359
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good enough</font>

1016
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,830
you
