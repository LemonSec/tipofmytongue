00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,268
for some of the bikes if you have keys

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,580
for the bike please hand them back down

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,320
at the info booth if there's no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,759
at the info booth go down to the bar and

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,529
give it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bartenders</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they will know</font>

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,510
where it is so if you borrowed a bike

9
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,619
please hand back the keys that is pretty

10
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,420
important we have to hand them back

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,939
pretty soon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are leaving</font>

tomorrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we have is cam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who is leading up our</font>

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,040
network team here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> upon hack for the</font>

15
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,190
first time and he will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit</font>

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,019
about the week off from his view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

17
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:43,440
network let's give clumsy a big hand

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:45,450
thank you so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the only one doing</font>

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,309
the network we have Peter Cobra who's

20
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,840
working at bone fiber we have some

21
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,209
people at global connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that power us a</font>

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,649
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of equipment we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roughly walking</font>

23
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,690
around doing a lot of stuff we have

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,690
eight dot that has helped a lot so we

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,849
are a larger group<font color="#CCCCCC"> than just me but I</font>

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the pleasure of doing the</font>

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,870
presentation so and you're welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

28
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the presentation afterwards there's</font>

29
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,340
also a reference to a Danish blog post

30
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,200
where I wrote a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about this</font>

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,140
network that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> building and what</font>

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,509
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we got here so the state</font>

33
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,220
of the network is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sniffing all</font>

34
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,549
collected all neural processes all

35
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,740
exploited all that is not our thing so

36
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,740
we have deliberately said that we would

37
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,990
not save any information you we would

38
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">not do netflow we would not do ideas we</font>

39
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,070
have two haven't on IPS we're not doing

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS censorship we are putting you</font>

41
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,169
directly on the internet and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

42
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,509
saving a thing from the network which is

43
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,790
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it made some</font>

44
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,220
debugging this week a bitty pretty hard

45
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,770
so next year we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would probably start</font>

46
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,729
doing a like a me report that we can

47
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,470
pull some traffic from if we need to but

48
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,380
the NOC has on purpose not been

49
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,600
collecting a lot of stuff we have a

50
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,729
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of information like the mac</font>

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,710
address of your wireless devices that is

52
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,719
saved in a unified controller which is

53
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,759
the wireless but that will get deleted

54
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:11,519
before we leave these premises that is

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,420
my particular promise to you so a normal

56

you're not doing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the network a</font>

59
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,050
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are on the network doing</font>

60
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,839
something but probably doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH</font>

61
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,480
probably downloading a little bit even

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">downloading a big one gigabyte file is</font>

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,200
not much on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this network because you</font>

64
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,480
have a gigabit connection so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

65
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peaks the green ones are</font>

downloading to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network perhaps it's</font>

67
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,458
just somebody running a speed test and

68
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,590
the blue purple stuff is you uploading

69
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,530
stuff to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so next year</font>

70
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,959
you're welcome to bring an extra pc put

71
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,060
it on a wire somewhere put on one or

72
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:55,060
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your favorite torrents I've been</font>

73
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,980
uploading from my laptop since kaylee

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:03,610
2016 2 was released in like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 36 hours ago</font>

75
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:06,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have been down uploading 130 gigabytes</font>

77
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,239
bring more devices next year and put

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,299
them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wired</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network we can use</font>

79
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,069
more bandwidth the preparations we did

80
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:17,799
before getting here was that we asked

81
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:19,570
the ripe NCC for temporary resources we

82
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,380
got an accepted ticket for an alias

83
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:25,720
number ipv6 and ipv4 because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we knew</font>

84
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,820
that we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run with public IPS</font>

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,209
for the participants we also wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

86
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,040
run ipv6 of course so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> August starting</font>

87
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,070
or start of all costs we got the actual

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,140
addresses and they were added to bone

89
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,209
fibers network so Peter Cobra was

90
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,828
announcing it to the world so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font>

91
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,290
make sure that it's reachable from the

92
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,230
world then we got all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way to</font>

93
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,959
thursday<font color="#CCCCCC"> i arrived with Fleming and</font>

94
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,850
offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you walk him on thursday at around</font>

95
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,519
two o'clock we brought<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of core</font>

96
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,590
devices network devices about six

97
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,720
switches were already here we brought

98
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,180
the fibers we brought some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet and</font>

99
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,760
so on and we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> missing a single cable</font>

100
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,989
was missing a single cable with these

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,850
connectors that are shown on the bottom

102
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't connect to the network</font>

103
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,049
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could set up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything and we</font>

104
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,000
could configure everything but we could

105
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,769
not connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet that was</font>

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,350
fixed on friday but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the first</font>

107
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,209
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we experienced on the network we</font>

108
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,700
also had another problem was which was

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the deliveries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a package for</font>

114

wanted to use about<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> euro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apiece</font>

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,230
hadn't arrived so the core network has

116
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,000
been this eagle nest of old cables that

117
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,370
we have used but luckily it seems that

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,620
they have all been<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but we could</font>

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have had some problems with that the</font>

127
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,620
but that's the best case with large

144
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,620
shit around the network but these

145
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,250
devices are pretty simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're not</font>

146
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to do a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of specific filtering</font>

147
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,290
do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP monitoring it would be</font>

148
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,539
much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have more advanced</font>

149
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,540
feature sets in these switches so that

150
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,790
people couldn't spoof DHCP and couldn't

151
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:13,950
actually run too many MAC addresses on a

152
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,750
single cable and so on but we were

153
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:18,300
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to borrow these because we</font>

154
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,910
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create a large network yo</font>

155
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,490
graphically even though we are very few

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">people on site we also have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used the</font>

157
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,720
wireless devices which are

158
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,349
enterprise-grade it's not the biggest

159
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:35,220
baddest it's just very simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> you purr</font>

160
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:39,330
kitty unify<font color="#CCCCCC"> you AP AC pro they have a</font>

161
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,960
speck of 122 meter coverage so that's

162
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,940
the most

163
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,068
were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the</font>

164
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,860
tent here and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the one of</font>

165
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:51,270
the huts over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can use the</font>

166
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:54,120
wireless at the sausage van so it's been

167
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:56,758
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been pretty few</font>

168
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,710
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so if we double or triple</font>

169
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,889
the number of attendees we will need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

170
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,388
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more professional wireless</font>

171
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,789
solution so if you know someone that

172
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,289
does wireless wants to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm guessing</font>

173
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,780
that we would use like two people

174
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:12,240
perhaps you you are next year and then

175
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,250
two people doing like wireless stuff to

176
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,770
people doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like core network stuff and</font>

177
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,229
one doing some kind of server stuff

178
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,940
because we also had a lot of problems

179
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:22,710
getting some service up and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

180
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,930
our management and monitoring purposes

181
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,590
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring for interfaces and</font>

182
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,419
errors and so on and it took us<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 24</font>

183
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,219
hours to get a running server from the

184
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">four that we have borrowed so they</font>

185
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,080
wouldn't start any of them and offer

186
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,479
switched memory and switched CPUs and so

187
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,568
on until<font color="#CCCCCC"> he got one working so that was</font>

188
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:45,330
a little bit bad we had about 900<font color="#E5E5E5"> meters</font>

189
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:47,400
of fiber some of them were 50 meters

190
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,469
some of them were 100 meters we were

191
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,690
using the 100 meters going<font color="#E5E5E5"> south from</font>

192
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,849
the core network the core network is in

193
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,860
the building over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and we had some</font>

194
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:59,400
50 meter which goes around in a circle

195
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,159
up here next to the speaker tent we also

196
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,349
i also got a delivery of some 50<font color="#E5E5E5"> meter</font>

197
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:07,169
ethernet cables which were used for

198
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:09,780
putting the power for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the access point</font>

199
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,240
in the boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then putting putting a</font>

200
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,270
50 meter cable out to the actual access

201
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,310
point which allows us to broaden out the

202
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,620
wireless coverage and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that will</font>

203
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,270
be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too if we can get</font>

204
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,130
some power or Ethernet devices that

205
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:27,060
makes it a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to power</font>

206
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,669
them we also got the uplink to bond

207
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,429
fiber we're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> border border</font>

208
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:37,380
gateway protocol bgp so we connect to

209
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:39,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP using two devices which I in a</font>

210
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,700
cluster and since we got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and</font>

211
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,730
running it has been running flawlessly

212
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,770
so the connection to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nearest active</font>

213
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,410
device across the fiber link to this

214
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,390
place has been very stable there has

215
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">been a little bit of problems out in</font>

216
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,720
their network but not not

217
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,370
not much a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit and there's a link</font>

218
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,120
at the bottom where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can actually go to</font>

219
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,610
stat ripe net and see how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

220
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,330
has been seen from the outside from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

221
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:11,090
internet we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this network</font>

222
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,450
drawing which is mine very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high</font>

223
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:17,150
skilled in the graphic design it's just

224
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,030
showing the various pops point of

225
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:23,420
presence and from the core you see that

226
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,520
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the south three two one which is</font>

227
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,370
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to the entrance so that was</font>

228
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,920
the hundred-meter cabling and we also

229
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,890
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one going over to the left which</font>

more participants we can of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course add</font>

more switches to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup if we need</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to and we have more switches we would</font>

236
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,729
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> also go ahead and buy like a</font>

237
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,500
250 meter 300-meter fiber cable so we

238
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,750
can do a rent to be done done path all

239
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,120
the way to the south entrance and

240
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,400
actually there has been people at the

241
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,170
south entrance because they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

242
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">living in the advance so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

243
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,420
bands that drove in to the field they

244
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,940
have been useless down there and I had

245
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,339
some D parking with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old son which is</font>

246
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,410
one of the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> living down there but</font>

247
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> south to pop actually it doesn't</font>

248
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,959
have seen much activity it's in the

249
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,180
nature area and I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be was</font>

250
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,830
a misunderstanding that somewhere it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

251
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,959
written<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there wouldn't be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wireless</font>

252
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,520
in the nature area but of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there</font>

253
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,380
will be wireless coverage in the nature

254
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,030
area just because you want to live in

255
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,900
the high grass you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get Wi-Fi</font>

256
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,910
we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the call a ring shown on</font>

257
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,790
this which is the West one and with 2

258
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> North one it was envisioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

259
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,380
we would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> an eating area up on the</font>

260
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,970
on where we have the power cars<font color="#E5E5E5"> parked</font>

261
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually there would be an eating area</font>

262
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,550
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are more people in a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

263
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,760
it might be needed but I think next year

264
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,729
we will just take a double link to the

265
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,950
hots the cabins and through the speak at

266
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,930
sent something like that and then pull

267
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,730
out some a piece more<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece on that</font>

268
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,899
area

269
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,490
yeah we had these great boxes from bond

270
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,889
hankou<font color="#CCCCCC"> Munna we were supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

271
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,470
some weather-resistant boxes rendered

272
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,750
but we didn't receive those so we were

273
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,000
lucky to get these boxes from<font color="#CCCCCC"> bond</font>

274
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">harmful moon and of course they need to</font>

275
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,260
be returned so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> early morning</font>

276
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,240
tomorrow i will start taking down the

277
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,949
network so if some of you want to help

278
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,839
moving these boxes when we have

279
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:30,910
disconnected them from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> south one and</font>

280
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,250
south to and south free the<font color="#E5E5E5"> south three</font>

281
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pup to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> removed i</font>

283
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,849
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be moved all the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 200</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meters</font>

284
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,079
up so if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help with that that</font>

285
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,180
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great and also i bought these</font>

286
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
50 meter cables hoping that we could

287
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,290
sell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the shop for the villages</font>

288
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,300
but we haven't seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> much big villages</font>

289
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,639
this year but next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year if you have a</font>

290
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,490
village if you have a tent please either

291
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,620
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 50 meter cable or buy one at the</font>

292
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:02,230
info desk so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could get fiber all the</font>

293
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">not fiber connection directly into your</font>

294
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,940
network with one gigabit that will also

295
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,579
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the Wi-Fi coverage so only</font>

296
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,029
Wi-Fi issues by tablets and phones and

297
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:14,739
so on the physical hardening was done by

298
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,589
these great boxes and we put on a

299
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,199
raincoat and we were lucky that eight

300
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:23,589
dot brought some omelets the colorful

301
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:25,269
ones which are near the pups and maybe

302
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:27,490
next year we would do the part where if

303
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:30,370
it's not connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network if the</font>

304
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:34,600
network is down it will change the it

305
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:36,550
will it will already<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh thank you so</font>

306
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,589
actually but we didn't say that because

307
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:40,120
it was arranged<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the last minute but</font>

308
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,190
if you bring them next year and

309
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,589
hopefully you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will then actually they</font>

310
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,660
will signal when this pop is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

311
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:48,639
network connectivity which is great way

312
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,089
to visually see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font>

313
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,360
network at that place the Wi-Fi

314
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:58,839
deployment was very very sparse it was

315
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,639
built by me and it was built<font color="#E5E5E5"> on devices</font>

316
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,850
that we bought more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less at the last</font>

317
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,730
minute and a wave<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOTS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to extra of the</font>

318
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:10,389
good Wi-Fi access points and I guess we

319
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,370
will either use those next year or we

320
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,290
will get another solution completely

321
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,600
another solution which<font color="#CCCCCC"> and can handle</font>

322
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all I think the maximum number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

323
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,510
uses for one of

324
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:22,360
these access points is probably like 30

325
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,090
40 there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been 36 users on some of</font>

326
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,520
them and how many kind of real access

327
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:46,480
point you how many users<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

328
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:48,579
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oh okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the most that</font>

329
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,690
have been in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tent have been like 36</font>

330
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,730
35 users at the same time also<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a</font>

331
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,800
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of problem with some rogue</font>

332
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,750
access points if people start their

333
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,020
access point on their phone or bring a

334
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:04,210
40 router it will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> up some of the</font>

335
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,980
frequencies and that will annoy the

336
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,630
network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font>

337
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,840
strict next year about telling people to

338
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,910
not run access points at all it has only

339
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:15,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">been mostly phones that people have been</font>

340
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,319
turning on I've been monitoring this

341

network with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unified controller</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

information we can see on the pie below

that there has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of clients on</font>

ipv6 only I have tried it and to get it

356
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,740
working really you you would add some

357
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,449
more stuff to it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually would</font>

358
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,850
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called translating from</font>

359
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:04,090
six to four so you would be able on the

360
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:06,640
ipv6 only to access ipv4 only stuff on

361
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,920
the internet but we didn't get around to

362
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,140
doing that and also another promise that

363
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,209
I made which I can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remake to</font>

364
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:15,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">trick is that next year we will do the</font>

365
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:19,600
EAP stuff we were talking about doing an

366
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:22,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">epa pete els with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> radius so you would be</font>

367
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use vpa in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surprise to get a</font>

368
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:27,069
unique key every user would get a unique

369
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:30,220
key and it would just accept any login

370
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,420
information like user and password but

371
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,210
that would actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> create a</font>

372
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:37,660
small VPN like encryption turn from your

373
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:39,250
laptop to the access point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

374
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,270
get that working and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry for that</font>

375
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:45,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">took I owe you one a problem I probably</font>

376
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:50,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bottle of absolut can can help a lot</font>

377
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:52,960
of that absolutely we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also see that</font>

378
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,000
the the witch access points has been the

379
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,770
most active and for a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

380
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boar nap too which is the one</font>

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:06,130
this is the by area bon app to is in the

383
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,080
sender i think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it on friday</font>

384
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,300
or was it saturday where you chase it

385
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,980
with your phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fleming that you could</font>

386
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually standing right next to it of</font>

387
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:18,310
course you could get 227 megabits

388
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:21,670
download and 165 make a bit of upload by

389
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:23,890
your phone so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like three times</font>

390
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,589
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I my home connection you could</font>

391
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:29,260
get at a bar<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle of the field</font>

392
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:36,580
with in trees and so on sitting drinking

393
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:38,500
and good beer cheers actually but I

394
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:41,590
think for our purposes with the number

395
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">of users we have this Wi-Fi deployment</font>

396
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:48,250
has worked nicely yeah and this access

397
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:53,620
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> crossed the 100 and gigabytes</font>

398
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:55,570
download it was on 31 of<font color="#CCCCCC"> August the</font>

399
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,520
Wi-Fi from control is also shown on this

400
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,700
one and the numbers are that we had a

401
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,430
maximum concurrent users of about 110

402
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:06,130
clients total and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in total we</font>

403
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:09,220
have seen 120 clients different mac

404
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses so most people have probably</font>

405
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,560
had like one or two two devices or maybe

406
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:19,360
three and been using them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the network</font>

407
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:22,300
the uplink totals on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Friday noon was</font>

408
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:26,649
that we have downloaded 710 gigabytes

409
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:29,409
yay and uploaded 328 gigabytes which is

410
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:33,160
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot but it is more than most</font>

411
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:36,910
people use in a weekend I guess also

412
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:40,690
this these graphs<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose some precision so</font>

413
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:42,880
some of the spikes will be flattened out

414
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,890
because it runs with and is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SNMP</font>

415
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">average over five minutes</font>

416
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:50,680
and also it loses some precision as time

417
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,530
goes by so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be the specific</font>

418
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,140
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot take these spikes as being</font>

419
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:59,770
the maximum in use at those times

420
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,570
usually when you download a big file it

421
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,180
will be finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly on this</font>

422
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,730

show all links in my network that has

456
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:54,760
it's a hugely helpful network management

457

unplugging a device makes it go offline

471
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:41,020
so that was a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem people just</font>

taking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power from it it was not</font>

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,209
shuffling around stuff and moving stuff

479
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,240
into these<font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moving cables and</font>

reusing the power strips inside the box

00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,930
instead of having the power pulled out

482
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,669
because we were adding more devices

483
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,500
through the box so it made more sense of

484
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,630
using the power strip inside the box and

485
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,120
we cannot move the cable so quickly that

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bug the switch was powered all the</font>

487
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,909
time so we had some small power outages

488
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:22,480
the first days we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen issues</font>

00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:26,200
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jo EPA sometimes people were</font>

492
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,590
they were getting horrible results but

499
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,770
actually we were getting results like

00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:56,680
850 megabits and nine around 850

501
00:21:53,770 --> 00:22:00,340
megabits both ways and actually because

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP the way it ramps up the short</font>

503
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,570
time of testing you could see that it

504
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,910
was rising all the time so that actually

505
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the testing finished before it reached</font>

the full<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 gigabit but i'm pretty sure</font>

507
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it would have reached the full</font>

509
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:18,549

00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:34,480
we also see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some around 2,300</font>

515
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:36,429
something on Wednesday there was perhaps

516
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,159
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of either small wireless</font>

518
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,500

519
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,510
investigate these outages because we

520
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,080
didn't do any net flow monitoring we

521
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:51,520
didn't do any packet capture so some of

522
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,279
these small outages cannot be

523
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,929
investigated more on Thursday there was

524
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:58,600
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of people reporting DHCP</font>

525
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,070
problems and we researched it using new

526
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,408
devices that have never been on the

527
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:06,010
network to see that we got DHCP

528
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:07,630
responses but I noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

529
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,179
device it actually said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it had</font>

530
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,340
dropped some DHCP packets because of bad

531
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:14,830
options so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody knows more about</font>

532
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that or have seen that before maybe we</font>

should investigate that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year or</font>

534
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,490
maybe which I should do some kind of

535
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:23,469
locking for the dhcp packets or maybe

536
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,649
detailed locking on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP server</font>

537
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,899
instead of running the HP on the SR exes

00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:33,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">I hope next year we will use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some open</font>

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,918
have also<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen some app traffic which is</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit annoying I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if</font>

542
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,630
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of our big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network it's</font>

543
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:46,779
quite a large network with thousand IPS

544
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:49,270
we have or it may be that somebody is

545
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:51,580
doing scanning it may be that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

546
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,080
doing scanning<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the outside so it's</font>

547
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,149
a little bit difficult to investigate

548
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,129
because I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this much</font>

549
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:59,620
opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like mirror the traffic</font>

550
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:03,399
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see which interface it comes in on</font>

551
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,770
and which interface it leaves on so next

552
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:08,529
year I hope we will have more isolation

553
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,600
between the functions so we can use more

554
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:13,059
time investigating stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> but just is</font>

555
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,750
strange so we can improve the network

556
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:20,379
and we will make the EAP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network work</font>

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,070
coverage this year has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

564
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,509
weak so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the info desk and</font>

565
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,509
suggesting a place where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put</font>

566
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:42,129
access points would have been good it's

567
00:24:40,509 --> 00:24:44,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably too late to start deploying a</font>

568
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:47,649
lot of wireless or changing it a lot but

569
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:51,639
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm already in my head starting</font>

570
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:53,498
to plan the next year's network so the

571
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:55,928
conclusion is that the camp used to

572
00:24:53,499 --> 00:25:00,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">little date data use more bandwidth next</font>

573
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:01,419
year make sure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring torrent</font>

574
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,119
seedboxes with your favorite

575
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:06,100
distributions make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you get</font>

576
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected to the Pops with network</font>

577
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,039
cables so next year perhaps bring a

578
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:14,169
switch or a small router small firewall

579
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:15,999
that is what we do when we visit the

580
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:18,100
bigger camps we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put up a</font>

581
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:20,200
firewall in our own tent so we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

582
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">a private network behind that where we</font>

583
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,999
can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a printer and so on overall I</font>

584
00:25:23,049 --> 00:25:28,179
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the callings have been stable and</font>

585
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:30,730
we've been pretty happy wife I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

586
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:34,149
but not great but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was what what I</font>

587
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:38,799
expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we are we're not that many</font>

588
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:40,629
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> so getting a huge complex really</font>

589
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">Enterprise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create Wi-Fi was out of the</font>

590
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:45,129
question at least so tell us your wishes

591
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:47,080
for next year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have some plans and</font>

592
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:49,119
want to do some more dashboarding so you

593
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,460
can see it live all of you because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

594
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the data already and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually had</font>

595
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:56,259
some templates for these live days

596
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,299
dashboards but since the server was

597
00:25:56,259 --> 00:26:03,009
delayed a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did never deployed them</font>

598
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:05,830
anywhere so that's it from us the

599
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:08,350
network team offer your<font color="#E5E5E5"> King Peter</font>

600
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:10,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Carson Peterson everybody doesn't</font>

601
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:14,908
surplus so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for coming and</font>

602
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:14,908
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network questions</font>

603
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:32,600
there's a there's no unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

604
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:35,449
have no knowledge about how many packets

605
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,250
is one protocol one is the other but i'm

606
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,279
pretty sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a lot of FBI</font>

607
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:44,870
pv6 there has been a lot of devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

608
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:47,210
just defaults to ipv6 we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able or</font>

609
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:50,029
you can test out if you do a ping to the

610
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,950
all notes multicast on the network you

611
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:54,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">will actually get a response so you can</font>

612
00:26:51,950 --> 00:27:17,450
estimate if it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably something</font>

613
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:29,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">like 30</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah I don't I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

614
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:33,289
any statistics we have to have more VPNs

615
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,850
with ipv6 i've been using<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 all week</font>

616
00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:36,830
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been great and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

617
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipv6 only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network there was only</font>

618
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:40,610
a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that didn't work for me</font>

619
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,279
which was something like I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> hipchat</font>

620
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,408
perhaps or and a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail account i</font>
