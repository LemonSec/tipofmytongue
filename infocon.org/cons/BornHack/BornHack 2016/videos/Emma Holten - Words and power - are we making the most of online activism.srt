1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,880
who is going to talk give her talk

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:14,940
that's called consent hello<font color="#CCCCCC"> and thank</font>

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you so much for having me my name is</font>

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,539
Emma Holton and I work mainly in the

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">area of revenge porn and consent</font>

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,600
violations online but that's not

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,119
specifically what we're going to talk

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,490
about today I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was more</font>

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,619
relevant in this context to talk about

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,140
what I do a lot which is to kind of

11
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,410
attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make regular people care</font>

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,120
about internet rights I guess this is an

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,718
area that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are engaged in</font>

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,019
and it is my experience that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,000
are having extreme difficulty getting

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,510
people who are not directly involved

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,539
with tech or IT to genuinely care and

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,089
understand why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important why</font>

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,949
stuff like surveillance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important or</font>

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,840
my stuff like consent violations is

21
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,420
important because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have a sense that</font>

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,309
it's somehow not relevant to them can

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,450
you hear me even though it's windy<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

24
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:09,240
great so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,340
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the because I'm a humanist I'm</font>

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,408
from the humanities and what I do is I

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,170
analyze so what we're going to talk

28
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,540
about today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the language and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,400
that we cast these issues the words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,200
we use to describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is that we</font>

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
work with and the words<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use to</font>

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe why it is that we find these</font>

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to be so important because in</font>

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:32,369
working with this I've had some<font color="#E5E5E5"> insights</font>

35
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,850
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> why people think that it's not</font>

36
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:41,610
relevant to them so this can what we're

37
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:44,729
going to talk about so I'm guessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

38
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,579
you probably all know this mask I didn't

39
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,170
bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was here already so I'm</font>

40
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,039
thinking that you all know this the

41
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">symbolism of what this means um you've</font>

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,450
seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a million times and I suppose</font>

43
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,048
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a lot of us this mask has come</font>

44
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,210
to kind of represent a lot of the things

45
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,430
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we as Internet activists are</font>

46
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,500
passionate about which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like</font>

47
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,569
the story<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the little guys standing up</font>

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,970
to the big corporations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and standing up</font>

49
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:13,920
to multinationals and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

50
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,209
using our ability to be

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,119
smarter than them and better than them

52
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,180
at what they do and to subvert their

53
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,989
power and the thing that this mask also

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">symbolizes is anonymity we have this</font>

55
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,950
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this movement that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font>

56
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">faceless right it doesn't it could be</font>

57
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,640
basically anyone wearing the mask it

58
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,200
could be a woman it could be a person of

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">color it could be a trans person could</font>

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,708
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a man whatever we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can all be</font>

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,330
anonymous that is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic</font>

62
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,069
premise<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the movement and it's the</font>

63
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,900
basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> premise of the WikiLeaks movement</font>

64
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:44,549
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the open-source</font>

65
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,700
movements have the anonymity thing as

66
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:52,440
well and this symbol<font color="#E5E5E5"> mask or whatever</font>

67
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,480
can kind of be attached<font color="#CCCCCC"> to any deed</font>

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,340
sometimes it's attached to fantastic

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,170
things and as we all know sometimes it's

70
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,299
attached the things that we don't

71
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:04,048
necessarily support as a movement or as

72
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,819
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> group or even as individuals but I can</font>

73
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:10,950
really understand why there is a certain

74
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:13,619
appeal to this that this like vigilante

75
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,720
activist who uses his brains to outsmart

76
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,250
people who are much richer than him much

77
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,730
bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> than him who have much more power</font>

78
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:22,709
and we're enthralled by this idea its a

79
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,709
david-and-goliath story right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

80
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:26,940
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy sitting in his basement and</font>

81
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,250
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really good at his computer</font>

82
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,579
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using his computer he can</font>

83
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:38,100
subvert these immense powers that

84
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:42,630
otherwise would try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to control us and I</font>

85
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we all observe especially</font>

86
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who are at things like this</font>

87
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,120
society around us that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying to</font>

88
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,400
subvert and attack our civil rights

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,079
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's through government</font>

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">surveillance or through market</font>

91
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,500
surveillance I think we're all kind of

92
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,298
observing a movement where we feel like

93
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a dis integration of our rights</font>

94
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,940
and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do is we do we</font>

95
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,640
make we have these anonymous movements

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,260
and we are kind of loosely attached to

97
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,819
them but we also kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of support them</font>

98
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,489
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we feel that they are the</font>

99
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,958
responsible giving to this violence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

100
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">is being done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> against us and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

101
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,139
that'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> add that analysis is true and I</font>

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> every one of us who spent</font>

103
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,789
like even five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes on the internet</font>

104
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,600
will know that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the democratic</font>

105
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:29,210
place that it was once heralded to be

106
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,610
it's very dawn it is has not become this

107
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,109
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> democratic revolutionary</font>

108
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,940
place it is a place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

109
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,520
silenced people are committed violence

110
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,950
against entire movements are silenced

111
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,840
Palestine<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being removed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from google</font>

112
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,510
maps there are all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,210
all sorts of instances where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see</font>

114
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,940
traditional forms of power being

115
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,039
reproduced online the internet did not

116
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,650
become this place where the smartest guy

117
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,900
always wins sometimes money wins and

118
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,349
sometimes power that exists in the real

119
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,599
world also<font color="#CCCCCC"> wins online logic doesn't win</font>

120
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,030
the right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong doesn't win sometime</font>

121
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,600
wrong wins I think we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

122
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:10,729
aware of that so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's that</font>

123
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,220
odd that we need something to rally

124
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,380
around we're observing and injustice and

125
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:18,320
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do better we're trying</font>

126
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,300
to attempt to criticize it to attack it

127
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,930
from different<font color="#CCCCCC"> places we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it with</font>

128
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,640
words we do it with technology and we

129
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,790
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel mobilized by something I</font>

130
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:30,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's a pretty basic human need to</font>

131
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,510
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in a movement you see</font>

132
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,030
injustice and you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

133
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">who share the observation of this</font>

134
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,419
injustice and you want to work with them

135
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn from each other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and understand</font>

136
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,500
what can we do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this not happen</font>

137
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,390
and we want this and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

138
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">very important in terms of the anonymous</font>

139
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:52,580
clause or the anonymous ideal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

140
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">want our movement to be leaderless in</font>

141
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,539
the internet movement or what you want

142
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,120
to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the free internet movement</font>

143
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,370
there is this extreme hatred of

144
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,980
hierarchy there is this extreme hatred

145
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,960
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact the fact that some person</font>

146
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,700
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the face of something or some</font>

147
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,500
person should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be their leader or that</font>

148
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,250
there should be this specific ideology

149
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,680
connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do but what that</font>

150
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that what we end up doing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

151
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,520
need to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear agreement on</font>

152
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,680
what is right and what is wrong because

153
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,690
when you don't have a leader you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

154
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,540
have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of moral compass</font>

155
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:30,920
otherwise it's just everything goes to

156
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,750
Shambala it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in the movement and we</font>

157
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,700
want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a movement that's kind of</font>

158
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,010
everywhere we want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you</font>

159
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,020
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really grasp it it can be anywhere</font>

160
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,430
it could be anyone it could be me it

161
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,969
could be any<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

162
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:47,060
and this is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> central tenets of</font>

163
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,800
it we have pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong demands as soon</font>

164
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,060
as someone becomes a face of something

165
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,820
we kind of lose interest in it right

166
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,200
we're like fuck you you don't decide you

167
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,270
don't decide well how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think or what</font>

168
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,920
we do so<font color="#CCCCCC"> every time a person rises up</font>

169
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,460
and becomes a symbol of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is that</font>

170
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,020
we care about we tend to take some

171
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,330
distance from them which i think is

172
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,010
healthy but it also has consequences for

173
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,570
how we organize ourselves on how we

174
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:14,060
think so yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of what we're</font>

175
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:17,659
working towards I think at least

176
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,850
visually so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm standing</font>

177
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,260
here is that and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that I care</font>

178
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,320
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">victim of revenge porn in 2011 I don't</font>

180
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,240
know if I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to introduce the concept</font>

181
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:30,800
but prime material was stolen from me

182
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,160
and published online without my consent

183
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,020
for me it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was my email but it it happens</font>

184
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,240
on computers it happens on hard drives

185
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,780
it happens on mobile phones any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

186
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,410
a place where you can have material

187
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,659
things can be stolen from and this was

188
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:50,180
then compiled into a torrent along with

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's very difficult to</font>

explain what this feels like to a person

<font color="#E5E5E5">who hasn't experienced it but it</font>

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,720
definitely doesn't feel like being

198
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,030
anonymous anymore what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

199
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,160
it creates this extreme focus on your

200
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,549
person and every element of your person

201
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,740
and it is an extremely violent

202
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,320
experience that you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really escape</font>

203
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,090
the thing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is that as</font>

204
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,440
we know you can't escape<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's</font>

205
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,209
everywhere you're carrying your

206
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,440
violation around in your pocket with you

207
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:39,170
every single day and this was in

208
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">violation of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Danish law but as we all</font>

209
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,579
know lawmakers and politicians aren't

210
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,530
that interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in things that happens</font>

211
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:49,550
on that happen online so nothing really

212
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:52,589
came of the of the issue there is a huge

213
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know digital ignorance</font>

214
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,010
and to me I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was most</font>

215
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,180
surprising about this and how this is

216
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,630
relevant to what we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

217
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,390
today is that I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very surprised at</font>

218
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:06,720
how gendered it was what had happened to

219
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">me it was very specifically gendered the</font>

220
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,040
violence that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> faced was very specific</font>

221
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,109
to my gender I<font color="#E5E5E5"> very quickly realized</font>

222
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this type of violation is very</font>

223
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:20,880
heavily skewed towards one gender and it

224
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,160
felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though it happened to me</font>

225
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,320
it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> only about me it was also</font>

226
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,420
about people who had a general hatred

227
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,070
for people who look like me are people

228
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:34,140
who carried the same gender identity as

229
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:36,480
me and this felt because I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> been I've</font>

230
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,910
been aware of sexism online I logged on

231
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,290
to IRC when I was maybe 11 years old for

232
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,740
the first time I know that there are

233
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,959
people online who hate women but but

234
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,730
witnessing this having people come to

235
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,760
your home<font color="#CCCCCC"> and throw stones at your</font>

236
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,410
window and having people send material

237
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,680
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they stole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from you to your boss</font>

238
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:58,260
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your family it gives you a very</font>

239
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,359
acute awareness that there is such a

240
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:03,090
thing as violence on the internet and

241
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,100
that it has very very severe effects on

242
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:08,070
your mental<font color="#CCCCCC"> health on your pub on the</font>

243
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibility to gain employment on your</font>

244
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:18,030
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> circle on pretty much every</font>

245
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:21,480
aspect of your life but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I was very</font>

246
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:23,939
and I maybe naively surprised at the

247
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,310
extreme joy that some people find in

248
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,660
destroying other people's lives this was

249
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:35,099
not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> hateful so much as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

250
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,959
was entertainment my destruction was a

251
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,160
form of entertainment people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind</font>

252
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,650
of you know went on 4chan and just asked

253
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,089
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a few hours and you know sent</font>

254
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,890
some day<font color="#CCCCCC"> ploetz to me and then they</font>

255
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,420
logged off and did something else it was

256
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a way part of the way that they</font>

257
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:56,310
were online some guy even bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emma</font>

258
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:58,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">holton com2 can optimize SEO for the</font>

259
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,000
pictures so they would come out on top

260
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,530
for sure because he was noticing that I

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,060
was kind of kind of trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

262
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,510
pictures away so yet they want they

263
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,760
wanted

264
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:14,160
be bad let's put it like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

265
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,620
took about three years of living<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

266
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,510
this to understand that this was not a

267
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,160
personal attack that had anything to do

268
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,950
with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this was a much more</font>

269
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,110
structural issue that had to do with who

270
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,540
has the power to be anonymous who has

271
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,670
the power to not be and what happens

272
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">after that power has been taken away and</font>

273
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:37,439
especially I<font color="#E5E5E5"> came to realize as I said</font>

274
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:40,020
before that this was a very gendered

275
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,140
type of violence that it definitely was

276
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:46,770
not unimportant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a young woman</font>

277
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">in these pictures my age mattered the</font>

278
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:55,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">nature of the picture mattered my gender</font>

279
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:57,570
definitely mattered and what I came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

280
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:00,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand also was that my abuse was</font>

281
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,430
being sold as a product<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it was</font>

282
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely very profitable to do these</font>

283
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have sites that made</font>

284
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,960
this possible so for me criticizing

285
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,699
capitalism also came became a very

286
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,700
integral part of understanding what

revenge porn is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> outlawing revenge</font>

293
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:36,480
basic rights so I bet I started working

294
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,430
as an activist on this issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't</font>

Chani there's this guy sitting with a

teacup saying eat shit and then there's

really crude

and like i said it's very for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Channing</font>

313
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:26,369
is that as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you're anonymous</font>

314
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:29,128
online you're a man I know this very

315
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:30,689
very well people get very surprised once

316
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:32,399
they find to find out you're a woman you

317
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:35,009
could hang out in chat rooms or in

318

boards for years and years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

319
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,249
suddenly they realize you're a woman and

320
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,079
it's like your<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole demeanor changes</font>

321
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:42,029
everything you've ever said just means

322
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,339
something completely different and<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

323

<font color="#E5E5E5">from a completely different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place and I</font>

324
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,269
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's important when we discuss</font>

325
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,709
what it is that the anonymous movements

who is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that we're talking about when</font>

we're talking about the user who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is who</font>

is this person and who is the person

we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're talking</font>

332
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:14,639
about who's behind this um and it made

333
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">me feel like that in the internet</font>

334
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,980
movement in general there was really not

335
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:22,379
a space for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the</font>

gendered experience of having an

experience of internet harassment and to

341
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,870
it was me and it was me as a young woman

342
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,160
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was me living in Copenhagen it was me</font>

having all these types of experiences

344
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,719
but it was also me having the extreme

345
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,149
privilege of having a college<font color="#E5E5E5"> education</font>

346
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,970
or having the means to do activism on

347
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:51,209
this issue I was not just any person and

348
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,069
that kind of and that kind of open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

349
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:57,300
some issues to mean how it is that we

350
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:59,248
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about this because we have this</font>

351
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,559
idea that the faceless person is the

352
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:05,160
brave person right that if you that if

353
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:07,469
you need to be public with your identity

354
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,540
or your person is because your hacking

355
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,189
skills or your skills<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coding can</font>

356
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,219
aren't enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to speak for themselves</font>

357
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:17,248
like why would you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be a</font>

358
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">person because I I like I can be moot</font>

359
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,879
all day long and I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

360
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">person everyone knows me anyway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

361
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,559
i'm just so important and that just

362
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,079
wasn't a privilege that was given to me

363
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">i was very specifically gendered and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

364
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,380
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> gendered for the rest of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

365
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,780
life and I think that I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> left</font>

366
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,939
with a sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have an issue</font>

367
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,520
dealing with what happened to me in this

368
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,530
community because it is so specifically

369
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,069
gendered and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so heavily geared towards a</font>

370
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:48,360
specific group in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the population because</font>

371
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:51,180
this faceless vigilante ideal erases a

372
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,280
lot of difference and it erases a lot of

373
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:56,250
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> vulnerabilities in society</font>

374
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,230
another example is how poor people

375
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:01,290
especially our victims of surveillance

376
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:04,290
much more so than rich people are and I

377
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:06,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also an issue that is</font>

378
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,969
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> not talked about so much that</font>

379
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,880
some people are hip specifically much

380
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:14,220
much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than others by internet</font>

381
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,230
violence and by cyber crime or by

382
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:21,420
general violations of their civil rights

383
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:23,970
and I feel that also when I want to talk

384
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,800
about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always in this</font>

385
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:28,500
movement forced to kind of make it

386
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">relevant to everybody I'm forced to kind</font>

387
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,670
of translated into how it would look at

388
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:35,610
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for if it were to happen to a man and</font>

389
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:38,099
I can understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

390
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,520
relevant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make general points but</font>

391
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,020
also maybe it's just is more relevant to

392
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,430
women to talk about this specific issue

393
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,410
and that should not make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it less</font>

394
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,430
relevant to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> movement as a whole and</font>

395
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:52,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have met extreme</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a resistance to this</font>

396
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,089
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thinking to Wed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way of</font>

397
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,589
introducing identity politics into the

00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet movement has been very very</font>

399
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult and it continues to be</font>

400
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult because we have this ideal of</font>

everyone being the same and of all of

right and wrong being the same to

403
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,920
everybody and what's important and

404
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,589
what's not important should be the same

<font color="#E5E5E5">for everybody and I think when we have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet rights I think we're shooting</font>

is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ourselves in the foot we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making a</font>

409
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,459
huge mistake because what we're racing

410
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:23,819
is why privacy important<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy is</font>

411
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,550
important and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

412

the same we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need privacy if</font>

413
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,320
everyone was the same if everyone looked

414
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,080
like this it wouldn't matter but they

415
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,750
don't the reason people need privacy is

416
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,179
because we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same bodies matter</font>

417
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,010
your life<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters your experience</font>

00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,559
matters what had happened to you matters

419
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,600
your socioeconomic status matters

420
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,730
your income matters your gender matters

421
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,120
your sexuality<font color="#CCCCCC"> majors if you're a trans</font>

422

private information what information can

424
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,779
be found about you online and what can't

425
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:02,940
it's basically do will<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get her ass</font>

426
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:04,950
or not another example is LGBTQ young

427
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,679
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada recent survey showed</font>

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,809
that LGBTQ people are victims of four

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,629
times as much harassment online than

430
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:15,509
their heterosexual peers which shows

431
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:18,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">that identity does matter we're not this</font>

432
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:21,149
anonymous movement of like Barbie and

433
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:27,720
Ken body's fighting together it matters

434
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:29,668
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we care about yeah so while I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

435
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,769
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be anonymous sometimes and I do</font>

436
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:35,129
I have anonymous accounts on many many

437
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:37,679
platforms none of us are all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

438
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:39,299
time and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we have neglected in in</font>

439
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">this movement to talk about the times</font>

440
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not anonymous the times when</font>

441
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,580
we were very specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> are us and I</font>

442
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:49,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that communicating this it is that</font>

443
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,559
moment when we very specifically become

444
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:55,649
us that we start needing privacy for

445
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,539
real that when we really start noticing

446
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:59,820
how we are different from<font color="#E5E5E5"> others and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

447
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:08,669
other people view us that is when

448
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:10,499
privacy actually matters and sorry and I

449
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:12,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of at the crux</font>

450
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:14,549
of why we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> having such difficulty</font>

451
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,070
communing communicating these people

452
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:18,629
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not reminding them of what</font>

453
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,460
makes them different we're reminding

454
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:22,769
them that we're all the same we're

455
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,539
always reminding them that everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

456
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:26,190
that that there's there is such a thing

457
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,320
as right and wrong and there is such a

458
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,179
thing as evil and good and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

459
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,850
relevant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody and that means the</font>

460
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to everybody and while I think that</font>

461
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:39,149
anonymous and the anonymous ideal the

462
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,850
movement ideal the non-hierarchical

463
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:44,158
thinking all these ideals that we have

464
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:47,248
are extremely noble and very very

465
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,499
important I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's also time that we</font>

466
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:51,629
start kind of critically engaging with

467
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:53,580
what are the actual consequences of our

468
00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:55,539
activism when we think about what it

469
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:00,158
means to be a human being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

470
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:01,869
in that way because what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that what</font>

471
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,850
is what happens when people start

472
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,678
wearing this mask or when they you know

473
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,439
when their head is a question mark is

474
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,889
that a question mark doesn't have

475
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,809
privacy a question mark can't consent to

476
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:16,090
what they think is embarrassing or what

477
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:18,908
they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is shameful or what they want</font>

478
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep private it's dehumanizing and</font>

479
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:24,549
what consent is and what I realized was

480
00:20:21,999 --> 00:20:27,669
that what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was very</font>

481
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:29,470
specifically a human violation it might

482
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:31,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">have happened through technology and it</font>

483
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,549
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been aided by technology</font>

484
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:36,249
proves very very human what happened to

485
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:40,059
me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was very violent because it</font>

486
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:42,009
violated me as a human being<font color="#E5E5E5"> and while</font>

487
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:44,710
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people might think that having</font>

488
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:47,649
pictures leaked is not so bad I did I

489
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:50,049
really did and I couldn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> over it</font>

490
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:52,508
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get over today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

491
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">just who I am and we can't make a</font>

492
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:57,970
general rule about how bad it is that

493
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,649
pictures leaked the only thing we can do

494
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,470
is engage with the individual and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

495
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:05,469
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what what is private to you</font>

496
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:09,220
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've put an extreme</font>

497
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:11,169
distance between how we talk about these

498
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">things we talk about the general</font>

499
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:15,940
humanity and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people experience their</font>

500
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,629
own lives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how people experience what</font>

501
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:22,149
privacy means to them because what I've

502
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:24,459
found out when I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to regular people</font>

503
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:27,070
who don't talk that much about<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest</font>

504
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,529
internet rights in general is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

505
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:33,158
private information doesn't mean

506
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:36,489
anything it's a it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> stupid concept</font>

507
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:40,659
because there is no such no general<font color="#E5E5E5"> rule</font>

508
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:42,220
for what private information is what's

509
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:44,950
important is that we realize that

510
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,590
private information is different for

511
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,509
everybody and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think in the way that we</font>

512
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate this we have kind of given</font>

513
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:55,119
people the impression that there is a

514
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,269
general agreement of what private

515
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,249
information is and when governments or

516
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:01,419
multinationals take this private

517
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:04,149
information they know what they're doing

518
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:05,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

519
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:07,030
bad and

520
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:10,270
and that we can criticize them for that

521
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,700
but what I'm observing has happened is

522
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:16,060
much more that what private information

523
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,880
means has changed it has no meaning

524
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore I think what people what many</font>

525
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,290
people would consider private

526
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:25,030
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen years ago coca-cola</font>

527
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,490
doesn't consider private information at

528
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,230
all where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are at any point given</font>

529
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,850
point in time what you buy at every

530
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,900
given point in time all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you</font>

531
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:37,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">know but if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we continue to use the</font>

532
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:41,650
concept private information we kind of

533
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:44,680
convey the fact that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a standard</font>

534
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:46,990
global normative agreement about what

535
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,760
private information is and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

536
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,090
conception of private information has

537
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,320
the same consequence as the mask it

538
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,169
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> us sound as if we're all the same</font>

539
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,270
that it's the same things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were</font>

540
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,070
ashamed of that it's the same things we

541
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,750
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep secret that it's the same</font>

542
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,139
things we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep to ourselves and</font>

543
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,660
it's not it's extremely extremely

544
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:09,520
different some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you all know</font>

545
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,200
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i'm guessing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that some</font>

546

people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your friend group think that</font>

me there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no one thing important about</font>

554
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,720
me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if the Internet has shown</font>

555
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,990
as anything is that it is extremely

556
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,030
different how we can consider privacy

557
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,890
what we consider private and why we

558
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,660
think these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are important we're</font>

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,800
not all the same we're not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font>

say no you all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the same</font>

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:15,010
where all the time even in the debates

572
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,400
we're trying to set these limits that is

573
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,700
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to everybody and the</font>

574
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,800
is that those limits don't exist I have

575
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,260
nude pictures on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> email so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> email</font>

576
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,780
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> off-limits for me if someone only</font>

577
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses their email for stupid work stuff</font>

578
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,440
maybe the email doesn't matter that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

579
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:33,780
to them but it matters to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

580
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,480
use it differently and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're</font>

581
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:41,399
losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concept and for me obviously</font>

582
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you can see cut the concept is</font>

583
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,410
consent is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the individual right to</font>

584
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:48,389
consent in every instance and I think

585
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that is what has been so</font>

586
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,940
drastically removed in the past 10 or 15

587
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:57,000
years is that so many things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just</font>

588
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,950
kind of the baby just thrown up out with

589
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bathwater right that if you want to</font>

590
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,810
be a citizen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Denmark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to give</font>

591
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,790
up so many things so many are so many

592
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:07,889
privacy rights you don't have a right to

593
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,470
individually consent to everything and

594
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,660
when we attempt to make this normative

595
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:15,810
ideal what happens of course is that

596
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's vulnerable people who are the most</font>

597
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:21,240
hit its people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have something to</font>

598
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,520
hide who are the most hit by making

599
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,500
normative standards for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is private</font>

600
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:33,270
and what is not but maybe the world will

601
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:35,280
go under so it won't matter and and

602
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:37,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what I'm observing right now is</font>

603
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,750
that what is missing in these movement

604
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,149
and movements and what is missing I mean

605
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,890
our conversations are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who are</font>

606
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,570
made very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable because</font>

607
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,520
they're told that if you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

608
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">about your identity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're making</font>

609
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,480
yourself less important if you can't be

610
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,220
under the anonymous umbrella if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

611
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,110
to talk specifically about poverty and

612
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,340
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience of poverty or you want</font>

613
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk specifically about your</font>

614
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,730
experiences with racism or if you want

615
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk specifically about your gendered</font>

616
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:06,120
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> you kind of excluded a little</font>

617
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,710
its kind of made less relevant<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

618
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of made as if it doesn't matter to</font>

619
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:12,510
everyone and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't matter to</font>

620
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,580
everyone a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel that it</font>

621
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,740
doesn't matter to anyone and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

622
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and a lot of people working in tech</font>

623
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,840
will maybe feel that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

624
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:23,970
humanistic but it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

625
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,669
talk it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the words that we use</font>

626
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:30,080
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we meet the critiques</font>

627
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,080
and how we meet the

628
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,090
the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people do and the</font>

629
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:36,520
experience that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have and I think</font>

630
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so afraid of</font>

631
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:41,050
introducing identity politics into our

632
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,730
movement because we need intersections

633
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,430
of race in class we need intersections

634
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:48,580
of gender if we truly want to understand

635
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:50,230
how surveillance is hitting us and what

636
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,250
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to our communities</font>

637
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:56,800
and the anonymous movement is fantastic

638
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,450
I really love it I think there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

639
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,820
many noble things so many important

640
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,430
things in it but so many experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

641
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,950
being erased because they can't because

642
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:13,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">so much of it happens under doesn't</font>

643
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:15,070
happen under a mask<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think sorry I'm</font>

644
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,620
a little quicker than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought is that</font>

645
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:21,250
ok because i want to speak I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

646
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak to you instead so what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think is</font>

647
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:29,950
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a an idea to what we could do</font>

648
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:32,020
is instead is to kind of have as the

649
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,880
basic premise that all information is

650
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,340
private until you've decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

651
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,800
isn't I think right now we have a

652
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,600
dialogue that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is every information is</font>

653
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,020
public until you say I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want this</font>

654
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,580
public and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that if we recast the</font>

655
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,560
conversation in that light I think

656
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,110
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have a much easier time</font>

657
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,540
understanding in because right now it is

658
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,370
my impression when I speak to people who

659
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,310
are not regularly engaged in this is

660
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,570
that they have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that that there</font>

661
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,850
is such a thing as private information

662
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,010
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to prepare</font>

663
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,570
to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

664
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:06,940
having them speak to each other about

665
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:09,159
private information it very quickly

666
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,440
becomes obvious that they don't agree on

667
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that means and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in itself</font>

668
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,100
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be someone something for us as</font>

669
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,260
activists and people working in this

670
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,149
area to kind of grab hold on and say you

671
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,800
know what that guy doesn't think it's

672
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,320
okay with medical journals but you do

673
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:25,540
don't you see that's an issue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

674
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,860
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that shows that</font>

675
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:29,560
the system as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right now is</font>

676
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,479
obviously not very and that some people

677
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,790
are getting heavily violated while some

678
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,650
people aren't and for some reason as it

679
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,450
always is it seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

680
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful don't get violated</font>

681
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,920
while people who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any powers</font>

682
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,750
seem to get violated a whole lot and I

683
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,850
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could take this mantle</font>

684
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:48,430
honest and continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this kind of</font>

685
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,050
David and Goliath ideal and say we still

686
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,030
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight for people who are</font>

687
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:54,040
victimized we still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight for</font>

688
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,110
people who are oppressed we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

689
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,210
to be the voice of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little guy or the</font>

690
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:02,229
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> girl or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the little on binary</font>

691
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:04,690
person and say we fight for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we</font>

692
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,810
realize your victimization in the system

693
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,730
we realize how you are wrongly and

694
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,129
skewered<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee oppressed in this system</font>

695
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,870
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and we're</font>

we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you with our knowledge</font>

698
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,130
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this area and understanding that you</font>

699
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:31,000
are much more heavily hit than the

700
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:34,810
regular person because all in all I

701
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,460
think that the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

702
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,960
challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason</font>

703
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,380
that I'm speaking on this subject today

704
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,840
is that once people hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

705
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,750
happening and once they kind of truly

706
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:50,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">grasp it and understand it they are</font>

707
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:55,420
worried they understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

708
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:57,580
issue but the scope of the issue and the

709
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:00,370
technical knowledge it takes to

710
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:05,020
understand this issue is so vast and so

711
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:07,510
complex that we need to talk in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font>

712
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,100
that relates to how people<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

713
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:14,470
themselves as different from each other

714
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:16,300
that is my general experience so when we

715
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,310
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about privacy you remind people how</font>

716
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're different not how they're alike</font>

717
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:23,320
I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think about</font>

718
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,810
about pride when I think about privacy I

719
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,300
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the things I do that not</font>

720
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:30,730
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people do and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

721
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:38,620
is important and I think that we've been

722
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:41,220
too bad at that sorry I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of losing</font>

723
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,219
track here

724
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:56,649
so like I said the reason I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need consent</font>

725
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:58,330
is because what's private to me is a lot

726
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:00,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what is private to a lot of</font>

727
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,770
other people because my situation is she

728
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,570
has shifted now now I'm a public person

729
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:06,760
and I'm a FEMINIST and I'm all these

730
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,490
things I'm working with issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

731
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:12,460
a little too much for her to handle for

732
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:16,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">some people and that has even changed</font>

733
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,400
how I view privacy now suddenly some

734
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:21,820
things that I didn't consider private at

735
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,370
all just a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago is tremendously</font>

736
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,070
important to me such as how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it look</font>

737
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,409
inside my house or what are the names of

738
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:31,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">my family members or where does my</font>

739
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:33,670
boyfriend live stuff like that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

740
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:38,679
didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I think</font>

741
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:43,840
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an area just to close off</font>

742
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:48,280
that we will as movement tremendously a

743
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:52,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">gain by understanding and employing the</font>

744
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:54,370
concept of privileged privileged is a

745
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,770
concept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very help that is used</font>

746
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:58,600
in feminism and the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about</font>

747
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:00,550
privilege is that you don't notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

748
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have it but once you lose it you</font>

749
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:05,530
notice very very quickly and privilege

750
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:09,639
is also what it feels like to feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

751
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:11,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have privacy I spoke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a person a</font>

752
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,840
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weeks ago who is on content</font>

753
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">gel which is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the basic income</font>

754
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,000
you get from the state in Denmark if

755
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,189
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> unemployed or very mentally or</font>

756
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,930
physically ill it kind of helps you

757
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:27,820
survive if you can't work and I was

758
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,590
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this person and she said to</font>

759
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">me that what had mattered to her was</font>

760
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:35,830
that I had talked about what the state

761
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,140
knows about our income because she had

762
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:41,110
been completely shocked when she found

763
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:43,690
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that not only does the state check</font>

764
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:46,719
her you know her income from the state

765
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,970
or her pet or her salary they also check

766
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,790
her in cat her account her entire

767
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,899
account they legally gained access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

768
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:57,509
her entire bank account every

769
00:32:54,899 --> 00:33:02,099
transaction like every Snickers every

770
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:03,570
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she said to me that a</font>

771
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:06,570
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I wouldn't have</font>

772
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:08,908
found it violating but now I do now I

773
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,408
feel tremendously violated by the fact

774
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:13,679
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have access to this</font>

775
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:15,389
for me to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> my money and I think it's</font>

776
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of this emotion we need to mobilize</font>

777
00:33:15,389 --> 00:33:20,189
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> people feel why this matters</font>

778
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:22,199
that if you have privacy it's a

779
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:25,440
privilege it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you lose</font>

780
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's right that you lose privacy as it</font>

781
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,830
is right now is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a right it's a</font>

782
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:31,169
privilege and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different</font>

783
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,939
concept because people feel that rights

784
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:34,919
is something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't lose in a</font>

785
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,599
civilized<font color="#E5E5E5"> society but privilege is</font>

786
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,029
something that you most<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely lose</font>

787
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,830
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we kind of need to</font>

788
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:43,679
employ this wording if we want people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

789
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:46,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that privacy isn't a right</font>

790
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,839
anymore it stopped being a right a long

791
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:50,700
time ago and stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a ride to me it</font>

792
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:53,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">started stop being a right to that woman</font>

793
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,099
it was a privilege to us and we lost it

794
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:58,200
and that put us in a drastically

795
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:02,939
different position than we was when we

796
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:08,010
were before so it's kind of something's

797
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:11,520
up we're not all alike we're not

798
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:13,289
anonymous we're not a faceless movement

799
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,149
we're a movement of very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

800
00:34:13,289 --> 00:34:16,770
individuals with very different limits

801
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:19,739
with very different impressions of what

802
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:21,839
is private<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what is not and instead</font>

803
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">of seeing this as a weakness that will</font>

804
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,058
split us up we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should see it as a</font>

805
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:33,629
strength in communicating why what we do

806
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:35,819
is important and I think if we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

807
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:37,500
there are a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> left to be</font>

808
00:34:35,819 --> 00:34:39,210
mobilized in this there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font>

809
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,899
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> left who could care about this</font>

810
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,789
who would understand why the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is</font>

811
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:48,750
a democratic issue and not a tech issue

812
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:50,159
and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm slowly getting to a</font>

813
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,319
point where I can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people about</font>

814
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:56,039
this in a way that seems every day and

815
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:57,420
mundane and I think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of us are</font>

816
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:58,950
experiencing that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font>

817
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,809
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> a direction where people are going</font>

818
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,700
to care<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this because it</font>

819
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:05,339
is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more attention and if</font>

820
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,078
we talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little different if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

821
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,930
remind people how they're different and

822
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:11,140
what pride

823
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:14,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">see doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean we're going to go a</font>

824
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">long way thank you</font>

825
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,210
so I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some like discussion questions</font>

826
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:54,800
but I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anyone has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

827
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:58,040
question either way yeah I think I think

828
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,140
the question is privacy is important but

829
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,140
doesn't privacy and anonymity I guess

830
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,370
you also mean enable some of the

831
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:09,350
violence that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have been a victim too</font>

832
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:11,569
yes I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like maybe one</font>

833
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:18,319
of the biggest taboos in the anonymous

834
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:22,190
movement is that there is a basic

835
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:27,680
paradox in the issue of revenge porn as

836
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:30,500
such there is the obvious issue that

837
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,230
anonymous and the movements that are

838
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:36,740
kind of sprung out of anonymous in<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

839
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a has this openness ideal that has</font>

840
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,370
this you know lay everything on the

841
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:43,070
table and it will set you free right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

842
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:45,920
guess a lot of you will not be surprised

843
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,590
that that is not my opinion about how I

844
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,630
feel personally but there is also the

845
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:52,130
other thing which is that I have to be

846
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,420
honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the people who</font>

847
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,550
did what they did to me did it

848
00:36:53,420 --> 00:37:00,740
anonymously and did it through tor

849
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:06,530
browsers and did it on the Deep Web and

850
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:08,600
we have yet to to me at least have an

851
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,820
honest discussion about how we're going

852
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,250
to talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who use the</font>

853
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:18,080
tools that we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> democratic liberation</font>

854
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:21,380
to violate others I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

855
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:23,240
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> taboo for some reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can</font>

856
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,140
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> why because it kind of opens</font>

857
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,459
up Pandora's box and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

858
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,129
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you I don't have a</font>

859
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,890
solution for it I wish I<font color="#CCCCCC"> did but I don't</font>

860
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,870
I think it's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

861
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,710
really important conversations that we

862
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:41,529
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

863
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:44,170
if we accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the premise that there is</font>

864
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,540
such a thing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a violence online if we</font>

865
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:48,730
accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the premise that it has severe</font>

866
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:53,200
consequences for freedom of speech for

867
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:57,430
people for for democracy then should we

868
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:00,580
protect legally and culturally the

869
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:05,230
people who violate others by using tools

870
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:07,150
that we gave them I don't know what do

871
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:10,089
you think I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's difficult</font>

872
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:12,160
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is so much value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

873
00:38:10,089 --> 00:38:16,690
anonymity I think it's so important I

874
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:19,450
think it has that letting people talk

875
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,760
privately has had like the Arab Spring

876
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the way that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was used is just</font>

877
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,540
one example in the feminist<font color="#CCCCCC"> movement we</font>

878
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:29,290
use anonymity all the time because so

879
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:33,130
many of us are targeted but once you

880
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">start using that anonymity for bad and</font>

881
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:40,930
who decides what's bad do we do this

882
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,598
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy like and that's a paradox</font>

883
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:48,759
and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been very scared to talk</font>

884
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:52,089
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because it needs to kind of</font>

885
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,420
intersect with an issue that we have in

886
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:57,730
society in general which is what is

887
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:03,670
freedom of speech and should it be

888
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:11,339
limited and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you an</font>

889
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:11,339
answer to that yeah down there

890
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:25,830
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's difficult to sum that</font>

891
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:27,839
up did you hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> it okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great I think</font>

892
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:30,900
first of all we kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

893
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,490
challenge the dichotomy of either it's a

894
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,890
democratic issue other it's a technical

895
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue i think tech is the infrastructure</font>

896
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:39,750
so when we talk about tech we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

897
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,359
you know how does a voting booth work

898
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:45,360
how does you know how do we talk how do

899
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">we like tech is democracy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's how</font>

900
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:52,110
we engage with each other and I think

901
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:56,640
that I remember I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was talking to a guy</font>

902
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:58,890
at Google who who was kind of it was

903
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,450
very odd because it had like it reminds

904
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:02,640
me of this because it was very obvious

905
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:05,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> he was in denial about algorithms</font>

906
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,890
being political that he was like

907
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:10,740
completely a denial of that fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

908
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:12,839
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him but you know what we all</font>

909
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:14,609
know you know like the best thing in the

910
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,560
world sex drugs and rock and roll right

911
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:20,640
you do SEO about what people are

912
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:23,370
interested in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have these you</font>

913
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,170
know what is it 52 algorithms that are

914
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">secret that you don't want people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

915
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:30,150
but I'm guessing it's about giving

916
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,009
people what they want right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and well for</font>

917
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:35,460
three years what people wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> about me</font>

918
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:37,230
was violation it was violence it was

919
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,170
harassment it was private information

920
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:42,720
that they stole<font color="#E5E5E5"> from me and you gave it</font>

921
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:45,330
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to them right there</font>

922
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,339
as the first hit because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you made an</font>

923
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:49,140
algorithm that made that possible and

924
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:51,690
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that algorithm is</font>

925
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,250
necessarily wrong I'm saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

926
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the fact that that</font>

927
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:57,780
is the consequence of the way that your

928
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:01,680
algorithm is made and that that has

929
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:04,350
political consequences for me as a

930
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,419
person as a person in the real world as

931
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:10,500
a person using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet you did that</font>

932
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you helped people do that and it seemed</font>

933
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me that he kind of was in the</font>

934
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:20,640
algorithms are objective rational things

935
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:22,500
camp and I think that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

936
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily think that I'm advocating a</font>

937
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,640
position where we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about these</font>

938
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,560
things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what I'm advocating is a</font>

939
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:35,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">position where</font>

940
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:37,570
where we could I say we all the time I

941
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,410
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you see yourself as a wee</font>

942
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:43,990
but i guess some somewhat as a we could

943
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,609
gain much more power if we stop talking

944
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:47,890
about as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet as something that</font>

945
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:49,690
is separate from real life as something

946
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,589
that is separate from society or

947
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,960
something that is separate from

948
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,210
democracy but rather something that is

949
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,760
heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrated already in real life</font>

950
00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:00,370
like being a victim of revenge porn is

951
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,990
fucking real man like to me it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font>

952
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,880
anything I could close my computer or

953
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:06,250
anything like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

954
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,180
also gain much more power speaking that

955
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:13,780
way because people still don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

956
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:17,080
like that so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk about tech vs</font>

957
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:18,940
democracy unlike tech is democracy the

958
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:21,250
way we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> online and the</font>

959
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">infrastructure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the net has is</font>

960
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:27,820
democracy and that dichotomy is

961
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:32,440
different to get rid of but I'm trying

962
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:33,400
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if it was an answer</font>

963
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,790
but I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you had a question</font>

964
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,790
either

965
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,950
but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk about democracy i'm not</font>

966
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:29,550
talking about politics politicians are

967
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:33,240
useless sorry I've just I'm sorry I just

968
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:41,220
I have no time talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them I'm busy</font>

969
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:43,109
because because when i talk about

970
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,580
democracy<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm talking about every single</font>

971
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,350
one of us i'm talking about the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

972
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,140
we organize our lives in the way that we

973
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:53,069
organize our everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from are you</font>

974
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,600
know home pages to our whatever and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

975
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that that is where the internet</font>

976
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:58,259
actually has some revolutionary

977
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:00,690
potential still despite it being

978
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:04,220
colonized by capitalism with violence

979
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,220
yeah

980
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:33,169
I think it's much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more useful I think it</font>

981
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:37,700
has a much more direct consequence on

982
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:40,369
the lived experience for victims like I

983
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,720
don't maybe necessarily want to start up

984
00:46:40,369 --> 00:46:43,579
that discussion now even though that

985
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,609
discussion is interesting but a law like

986
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:48,619
the EU right to be forgotten law if I

987
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:50,930
had if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had existed when this</font>

988
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:53,660
happened to me I would not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have needed</font>

989
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:56,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stand up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here I could have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone on</font>

990
00:46:53,660 --> 00:47:00,470
living my life pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much as before</font>

991
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,868
could because it would have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

992
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:07,160
difficult to to find ways to violate me

993
00:47:02,869 --> 00:47:09,140
and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing here condoning that</font>

994
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,750
law in the way that it looks now I just

995
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:18,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to view to be clear on that but I</font>

996
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:20,329
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> introducing ways online to protect</font>

997
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,880
individuals in the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are now</font>

998
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:27,530
protecting corporations is a good step

999
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:30,799
like for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably know this</font>

1000
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:35,750
but on youtube if you attempt to upload

1001
00:47:30,799 --> 00:47:38,630
a video that has a copyrighted a sound

1002
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:41,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">bite on it like any bites like 10</font>

1003
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:43,970
seconds of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> drake song you can't upload</font>

1004
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,369
it it scans the material before you

1005
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:49,040
upload it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm having extreme</font>

1006
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:50,809
difficulty understanding why we can't

1007
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,210
apply technology like this to things

1008
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:55,670
that have been confirmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as revenge or</font>

1009
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:58,549
child pornography<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have extreme</font>

1010
00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:01,099
difficulty understanding why this is and

1011
00:47:58,549 --> 00:48:03,259
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of about</font>

1012
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:05,089
breaking the taboo and saying that some

1013
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:08,089
things maybe don't belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the public</font>

1014
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:10,308
sphere that some things after they've

1015
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:12,290
been leaked maybe we should attempt to

1016
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:18,109
look at how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use our tech brains</font>

1017
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:21,920
to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> people from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and the</font>

1018
00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:25,160
thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymity and the is that it</font>

1019
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,990
we have a difficulty talking about what

1020
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,299
happens when that anonymity is taken

1021
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:31,819
away from you and what happens then it

1022
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:33,920
is as<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we kind of live leave people in</font>

1023
00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:35,299
the dust after that has happened and if

1024
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,329
you didn't manage to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

1025
00:48:35,299 --> 00:48:39,170
anonymity bath too bad for you man we

1026
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:40,849
never removed

1027
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:43,339
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet sometimes we even</font>

1028
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:45,410
revel in the fact that things can't be

1029
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:48,078
removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the internet with pride and</font>

1030
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,970
joy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that as a person who cares about</font>

1031
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:55,309
internet rights can be pretty painful to

1032
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:56,959
see and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to have to say I'm</font>

1033
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:58,670
much more optimistic about tech

1034
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,430
solutions than I am about political

1035
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:09,530
solutions I'm pretty very hesitant about

1036
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:13,609
legal steps in this area I think making

1037
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:15,890
making it heavily a league like having

1038
00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:18,859
really strict laws about revenge porn

1039
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:21,558
for example tends to often hit things

1040
00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:23,660
that it shouldn't as does all lawmaking

1041
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,880
that tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that something through</font>

1042
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:29,720
something good online tends to be

1043
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:33,349
incredibly shoddily made tends to not

1044
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:36,890
understand basic facts about how the

1045
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:38,599
internet works so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not but that is</font>

1046
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:41,990
why I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are not</font>

1047
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:45,440
politicians to help me as to help me

1048
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:47,419
solve this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there is a</font>

1049
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,309
problem and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem river bench</font>

1050
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,170
Porter is similar to the problem with

1051
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:53,030
harassment the problem with hate speech

1052
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:54,589
is that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a discussion</font>

1053
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:57,920
about what are we going to do because

1054
00:49:54,589 --> 00:50:00,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working as is do we let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1055
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,670
people speak do we block them do we

1056
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:07,069
throw them out do we like and we or do

1057
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:08,510
we work it out culturally like that's

1058
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:10,400
also one of the things I do is that I

1059
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:12,500
talk about feminism I talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> women's</font>

1060
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,119
rights and I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know maybe</font>

1061
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,160
revenge porn wouldn't happen if more

1062
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:21,290
people it is not so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people hated</font>

1063
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:24,410
women but they do so now what so yeah I

1064
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:27,500
think I think the blocking tool is

1065
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:29,990
important and i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the blocking</font>

1066
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,579
to limits free speech like for me the

1067
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,899
blocking tool is like me saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

1068
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:38,480
want to talk to you you're an asshole

1069
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:41,660
and that is extremely<font color="#E5E5E5"> important because</font>

1070
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:45,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">i have like people you know sending me</font>

1071
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:47,509
threats all day long like using my inbox

1072
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:49,670
for the vilest things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need to have a</font>

1073
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:52,349
tool for them to not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact</font>

1074
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:55,200
me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of</font>

1075
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:59,759
why the block is as principal

1076
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:02,189
problematic but as for how I'm living my

1077
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:03,989
life right now I would not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

1078
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:06,569
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do in the</font>

1079
00:51:03,989 --> 00:51:12,930
places<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I do if I weren't able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1080
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:15,180
block people and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font>

1081
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:17,339
also a consequence of the fact that we

1082
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,859
have a very leaderless ideology less

1083
00:51:17,339 --> 00:51:23,519
movement is that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be extremely</font>

1084
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:25,170
strong on principle right is that we

1085
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,538
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have these really really strong</font>

1086
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:28,619
principles and suddenly if someone

1087
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:30,359
starts saying you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1088
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,279
principle is kind of getting away<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1089
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:36,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">within the way of my human rights we</font>

1090
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:38,339
have to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of them because we don't</font>

1091
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:40,229
really have a full-fledged

1092
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:41,999
well-functioning discussion about what

1093
00:51:40,229 --> 00:51:44,038
happens when these problems arises

1094
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:48,029
because we're afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the movement</font>

1095
00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:50,309
will disintegrate and I think that that

1096
00:51:48,029 --> 00:51:53,339
that is mostly the challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I feel</font>

1097
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:56,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I'm working in is that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1098
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:59,219
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been posed as Stan</font>

1099
00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:01,950
really hard principles has been also

1100
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:06,900
like you said a very strong part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

1101
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:10,019
has made this so difficult and and

1102
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:12,329
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge but it's it's not an</font>

1103
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:16,410
overcomer<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bowl but it is if we're afraid</font>

1104
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:19,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about it and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when I like</font>

1105
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:22,170
I'm not obsessed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anita sarkeesian</font>

1106
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:24,239
for example in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways that a lot</font>

1107
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">of other feminists are but you have to</font>

1108
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:29,519
be honest that has some valid points

1109
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:31,649
about you have to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

1110
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:35,968
youtube video without getting death

1111
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:38,099
threats and living underground and the

1112
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:39,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been part of this and we</font>

1113
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:40,650
have to have a discussion about what

1114
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:44,160
we're going to do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and and</font>

1115
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:46,589
especially especially if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this</font>

1116
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,779
self image of being the people who fight

1117
00:52:46,589 --> 00:52:50,640
for the powerless and being the people

1118
00:52:48,779 --> 00:52:52,349
who fight for those who have little<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1119
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:56,578
the face of those who have a lot and no

1120
00:52:52,349 --> 00:53:01,259
fighting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those who don't decide</font>

1121
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:03,180
everything in life we should also take

1122
00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:04,940
the side of people who suffer harassment

1123
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:07,940
even though they're women

1124
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:13,099
although I'm i understand it might be

1125
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:16,280
painful to some one last question<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

1126
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:18,760
someone who hasn't asked a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1127
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah</font>

1128
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:51,160
shorter terms and agreements letters I

1129
00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:54,460
think it can be made easier I think

1130
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are ways of of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

1131
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:58,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">very difficult to say you know for every</font>

1132
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,640
disease you know people notice again

1133
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:03,250
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that but I think like for</font>

1134
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,440
example we have in Denmark consent forms

1135
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:08,859
for what organs do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to donate</font>

1136
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,079
when you die I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that making forms</font>

1137
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:13,720
like that informing people in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1138
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:16,359
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> them able to even answer such a</font>

1139
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:21,848
form is could be a big step forward I

1140
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:24,430
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in terms of if I have to use</font>

1141
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:27,130
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Danish state we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

1142
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:29,680
have a huge internet systems portico

1143
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:32,799
which basically has all of our

1144
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:35,740
information on it and I think making a

1145
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:37,599
clicker for all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information like</font>

1146
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:40,450
living information health information

1147
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:42,339
stuff like that clicking and saying do I

1148
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:45,848
want people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in huge databases to have</font>

1149
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:49,630
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this yes yes no yes yes no no</font>

1150
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:51,819
no no no no no yes I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

1151
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be a way to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like basically</font>

1152
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:59,200
and while this of course like a more you

1153
00:54:54,910 --> 00:55:00,910
know logistical issue I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font>

1154
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,730
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be made easier that way</font>

1155
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:09,609
like for example yesterday I was called

1156
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:11,559
up or I called to ask from my friends

1157
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:14,109
cell phone and my friend is pregnant and

1158
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:17,079
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person on the other line from a</font>

civil court civil coo coo moon

1161
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:26,380
municipality they asked me how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1162
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:28,509
pregnancy because she was sitting with a

1163
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,880
screen with her phone number on it and

1164
00:55:28,509 --> 00:55:33,460
they had her entire history and they

1165
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,890
said how's your pregnancy and I was like

1166
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:38,140
what yeah I can see here that you're

1167
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:40,690
like four months pregnant<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like who are</font>

1168
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:41,920
you how do you know these things I'm

1169
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:46,569
asking you a completely different thing

1170
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,770
and I think stuff like that is stuff

1171
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:49,990
that we could talk about

1172
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:55,810
and that could pretty easily be redeemed

1173
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:58,330
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah remind people why they need</font>

1174
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:59,980
privacy in the first place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not</font>

1175
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look like Guy Fawkes I</font>

1176
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:06,780
think we're done<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know do we have</font>
