during the week and

40
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,560
all kinds of things other than that

41
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,560
information can be found on our website

42
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,199
we have a a pretty comprehensive info

43
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,040
page with

44
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,959

stuff like that so without further ado

49
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,880
let's uh let's get going

50
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,920
we have for a while not been quite sure

51
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,160
whether

52
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,079
whether born hack would happen at all so

53
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,399
uh it is uh pleasing to have a fifth

54
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,319
anniversary although it is

55
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,839
smaller than we would have hoped then

56
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
then you're all here to celebrate it

57
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,040
with us

58
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,000
and that is fantastic if you were here

59
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,040
during build up

60
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,519
thank you immensely for your help it is

61
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,959
we know it takes some some time out of

62
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,000
the calendar and maybe some extra

63
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,239
holidays and stuff

64
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,760
and it's a lot of hard work and it has

65
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,079
been pretty

66
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,920
sunny and hot to carry around

67
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,279
tables and chairs and building tents and

68
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,880
all that

69
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:56,240
it it helps tremendously and makes

70
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,600
makes the organizing team

71
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,519
full of energy and and desire to

72
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,880
to keep doing this because we we get so

73
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,600
much help from all your wonderful

74
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,279
build-up people um we still have a lot

75
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,680
of stuff that needs doing

76
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,360
most most of the big stuff works like we

77
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,959
have power all over the venue we have

78
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,800
internet and stuff like that but there's

79
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,479
a ton of little things and if you notice

80
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,639
anything

81
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
you can report it in different ways

82
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,000
we'll get to that but

83
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,760
but for now the things we do know need

84
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
fixing but we just haven't gotten around

85
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
to

86
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,279
or we just need more hands or fresh

87
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,279
hands

88
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,279
people who haven't been working for four

89
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,800
or five days in the sun

90
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,160
it doesn't have to be a big job but

91
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,560
sometimes when you've been working for a

92
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,040
while

93
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,000
it can be a big task just to do a

94
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
15-minute

95
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,920
job that takes two people so we have a

96
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,279
whiteboard by the info desk

97
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,479
please go there check it has a a list of

98
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
job that needs doing

99
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,519
how many people to uh to you need to do

100
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,399
it

101
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,399
how long time to expect to do it and a

102
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,079
contact person and it's a

103
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,320
stuff like distribute soap to the sinks

104
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,079
and stuff like carry some pallets from a

105
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,519
to b or some soda to the

106
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,199
bar area all kinds of little weird tasks

107
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
so if you want to help out that is an

108
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,760
excellent way to to get started

109
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,360
expect the venue to evolve during the

110
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,279
week we

111
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,360
sometimes intentionally sometimes

112
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,959
unintentionally

113
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,320
don't have everything finished by now

114
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,920
the name of the bar is the work in

115
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,800
progress bar because that

116
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,920
is constantly evolving and and the venue

117
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,479
is as well so

118
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,120
so don't expect everything to stay as is

119
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,040
right now

120
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,000
we we may surprise

121
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,719
so let's get um let's get this one out

122
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,959
of the way

123
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,560
i'm sure you're all just about tired of

124
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,079
hearing about this but um

125
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,920
we're gonna go over it carefully

126
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,560
and i'm sure we can all have a nice

127
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,279
event

128
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,399
without uh any unacceptable risks

129
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,439
we we are having this in spite of

130
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,760
of larger events being being cancelled

131
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,360
and

132
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,760
of course 20 000 people event would

133
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
might well probably would be a bad idea

134
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
right now but we at a size

135
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,199
where we feel and at a venue that has a

136
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
size where we feel that we can

137
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,839
actually maintain proper distance and

138
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,320
we've taken a bunch of

139
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,880
precautions apart from reduced

140
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,720
participation

141
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,000
of course as you know you were all lucky

142
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,199
enough to get a ticket

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,040
but not everybody was we have

144
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,399
much more room between people in the

145
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,719
speaker's tent so if you want to bring

146
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,480
three or four laptops now you can

147
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,720
and sit there with the whole setup

148
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,160
we're getting more cleaning from outside

149
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,639
people

150
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,560
partly because none of us are

151
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,120
particularly interested in cleaning the

152
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,279
toilets

153
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,199
and uh partly because they do a proper

154
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,880
job and they don't

155
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,479
they get a good night's sleep and they

156
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,160
don't hang in the bar until 2 a.m and

157
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,519
have to get up and do it and stuff so

158
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,959
we want to make sure this gets done

159
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,600
right so they they clean all the

160
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,839
surfaces

161
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,279
in the in the food area and the workshop

162
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,880
rooms and of course all the showers and

163
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,040
toilets and that's done twice daily

164
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,480
in the camping areas we have plenty of

165
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,519
room this year we are not that many

166
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,800
people so

167
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,199
please spread out there's no no reason

168
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
to

169
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,160
limit yourselves if you want to build a

170
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,599
village where you have some room between

171
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,040
the tents go right ahead we have

172
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,040
plenty of space this year

173
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,120
please remember the distancing you've

174
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,600
heard this a million times

175
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
make this a million and one then keep

176
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,720
your distance

177
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
especially in the bar and we're gonna

178
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,160
we're gonna be

179
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,560
throughout the week reiterating this

180
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,839
because the bar is a place where people

181
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,880
tend to uh maybe sometimes forget the

182
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,920
the good habits of the good covet 19

183
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
habits

184
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,160
so um so we're going to be pretty strict

185
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,239
about it at the bar all the seeding is

186
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,839
is done with a proper distance between

187
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,519
so you can you can

188
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,279
sit somewhere and talk and people can

189
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,240
still pass without rubbing against each

190
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,600
other and stuff

191
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,040
do not crowd the bar do not hang out uh

192
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,880
like like you sometimes would at a bar

193
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,480
the bar is for going to pick up drinks

194
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,639
and then they're going off to sit

195
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,199
somewhere

196
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,680
right and the same goes in the food area

197
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,319
uh

198
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,880
you you should keep your distance you

199
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,279
should

200
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,399
of course everybody wash your hands that

201
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,000
always goes

202
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,759
when you're dealing with food but in

203
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,600
particular now we have

204
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,480
loads of sinks there's a hand soap

205
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:29,920
everywhere we have loads of those

206
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:32,079
huge what's it called disinfectant

207
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,719
pump containers and you don't need a

208
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,000
full i mean you'll get a proper handful

209
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,120
they are a bit so just a tiny squeeze

210
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,519
will get you

211
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,519
properly

212
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,800
clean right

213
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,079
and wear a mask if you feel it's

214
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,279
appropriate we don't have a mask

215
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,359
requirement

216
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,639
we feel that if people are good enough

217
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,720
at this thing uh they

218
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,800
will leave it up to two people but

219
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,480
especially if you leave the venue or if

220
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,519
you're going to maybe a workshop or

221
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,199
you're gonna be

222
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,199
i don't know soldering and looking at

223
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,600
each other's

224
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,439
whatever then maybe consider wearing a

225
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,918
mask we sell them at the info desk or

226
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,000
you can

227
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,319
buy them yourselves we have disposable

228
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,319
masks for 10 kroners that are

229
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,119
from a danish pharmacy so they are they

230
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,280
are approved and proper disposable masks

231
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,319
and they should be good for i think

232
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,839
three to five hours

233
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,399
use or something like that and it's for

234
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,559
10 hecks oh 10 kronas

235
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,120
or hex please follow these guidelines we

236
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,240
have an

237
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,479
extremely low tolerance level for for

238
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,320
you know like of course there's no

239
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,200
corona deniers here but but we

240
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,200
we we really expect we know we we love

241
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,000
all you anarchists like we put in a news

242
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,559
post lately

243
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,360
but but these rules you actually have to

244
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,918
follow

245
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,320
we we have no tolerance bullshit in this

246
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,320
regard

247
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,840
and if you have any ideas how we can

248
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,159
improve this

249
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,678
we are not health professionals we've

250
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,720
followed all the guidelines we've gotten

251
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,880
from the government we've done

252
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,120
everything we can but if you see

253
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,240
an obvious room for improvement and it's

254
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,159
within

255
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
it's feasible to do and within budget

256
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,640
and so if we try to get a test truck

257
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,880
here from the

258
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
from the health authorities but they

259
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,640
said we were a few

260
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,280
too few people and i don't um yeah i

261
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
don't

262
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,678
i don't understand that but that we any

263
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,918
any ideas uh

264
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,080
sure bring bring them up by all means

265
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,480
let's get that hacker ingenuity going

266
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,918
i know people have been 3d printing

267
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,480
stuff we will have a talk about that

268
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,679
from

269
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,960
from jenny later in the week i think

270
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,039
yeah and and we think that's

271
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
that's exciting so if we can do anything

272
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,440
then that would be a nice legacy to have

273
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,080
for this

274
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,080
year's event

275
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,799
okay those of you who have been here

276
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,760
before and

277
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,000
and especially new people be aware we

278
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,160
have

279
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
a code of conduct we've had the same

280
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,960
code of conduct since we began

281
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,000
we haven't made any major modifications

282
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,640
to it so please read it it will be

283
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,600
posted around the venue and we have it

284
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,600
on our website

285
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,879
and it is important that you read

286
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,918
understand and

287
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,039
always follow it again we have no

288
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,600
tolerance for

289
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,559
for harassment and and stuff like that

290
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,360
the things

291
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,799
that i mentioned in the code of conduct

292
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,678
basic human decency

293
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,400
and we expect everybody to absolutely

294
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,400
adhere to it

295
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,880
i think that was all the serious stuff

296
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,360
let's go that's good to get out of the

297
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
way right

298
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,000
okay so volunteers i've already thanked

299
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,400
the the build-up crew

300
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,440
and uh and we are very happy about that

301
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,000
but as the week

302
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
progresses we still have uh lots of

303
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,559
stuff to do

304
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,240
and if you haven't joined the team um

305
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,080
maybe consider going to the website and

306
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,200
looking over the teams that need

307
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,760
help we have a bunch of them i'll have a

308
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,760
list

309
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,280
later with the ones that need the most

310
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,520
help but

311
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,799
it's a great way to meet meet other

312
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,360
hackers and

313
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,879
and a great way to help the event and

314
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,520
offload some of the work from the

315
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,520
organizers

316
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,918
so we like everybody have been hit

317
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,600
a bit financially by the by the kobe 19

318
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,159
situation we've had to cut

319
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,678
maybe uh three quarters of the tickets

320
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,320
we would have normally sold

321
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,000
this year or a bit a bit less but still

322
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,840
and a lot of our expenses are not

323
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,919
variable with the number of participants

324
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,799
like venues and stuff so

325
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,280
so this year we are especially dependent

326
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:45,520
on our sponsors

327
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,039
many of these are repeat sponsors

328
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,410
most of them have been here since the

329
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,520
beginning actually and um

330
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,919
[Music]

331
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,039
it says a lot that the the the sponsors

332
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,799
that have been with here

333
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,120
with us since the beginning are also the

334
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,520
sponsors that uh that turn out to

335
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,158
to still want to work with us during

336
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,240
this

337
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,640
i mean every almost every company has

338
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,799
been hit financially by this and

339
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,640
so we are immensely grateful uh please

340
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,840
send them my happy thoughts uh send them

341
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,039
some business if you can

342
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,639
uh just uh if you see

343
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,520
visitors from a sponsor here give them a

344
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,720
uh a sanitary live long and prosper

345
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,400
instead of a hug but

346
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,159
but still buy them a beer or do

347
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,400
something they've

348
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,760
absolutely made this event possible we

349
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,440
would not be able to uh

350
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,960
to to rent the venue and all that

351
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,480
without some help from these

352
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,960
organizations

353
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,600
it is also worth mentioning that as a

354
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,760
sponsor at bonheck you don't get any

355
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,600
you cannot buy a speaker slot you don't

356
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
get any influence over the event

357
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,879
in any shape or form you get the

358
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
exposure and you get your name

359
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,559
associated with the

360
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,760
event but you don't get any influence if

361
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,520
a sponsor

362
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,520
has a talk here it's because the the

363
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,600
talk has been weighed against the other

364
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,280
content and found to be

365
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,280
worth having regardless of the

366
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,678
sponsorship there's absolutely

367
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,799
no injection between those two

368
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,240
teams in that regard but that being said

369
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,840
let's give a huge round of applause to

370
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,840
the spencers

371
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:20,140
[Applause]

372
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,320
uh okay

373
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,959
so um we have a new venue map on the

374
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,678
website

375
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,559
uh and it will be evolving as we get

376
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,840
more stuff

377
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,039
put onto it it is it is uh yeah we

378
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,360
haven't had it for that long so we're

379
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,480
still

380
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,760
getting used to using it mostly you can

381
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,799
go see where we have

382
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,440
stuff like toilets and showers and power

383
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,600
outlets

384
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,960
and network if you need your network

385
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,639
cable plugged in and

386
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,159
the markers on the map have various

387
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,360
colors and various information you can

388
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,360
see it all on the website

389
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,799
first things first this whole area is

390
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,399
protected in some extreme degree that i

391
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,158
don't even know the name of

392
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,559
so we have to be very careful with the

393
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,960
venue and in particular

394
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,840
there's something called uh rich furrow

395
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,840
farming

396
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,039
about 10 000 years ago where they dug

397
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,039
these

398
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,480
trenches and you can still see them in

399
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,440
the landscape especially up by the

400
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,440
cabins and

401
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,640
especially if you go to the to the map

402
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,039
and turn on the uh

403
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,679
the altitude map then you can clearly

404
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,039
see

405
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,799
those uh those ridges dark and

406
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,640
they are very protected so they are

407
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,200
extremely sensitive about digging here

408
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,880
so

409
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,919
if you brought a shovel please put it in

410
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,080
your car and do not dig anywhere

411
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,320
because they they take that very

412
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,879
seriously

413
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,158
and and also of course no littering and

414
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,400
generally

415
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,600
take care of this absolutely beautiful

416
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,799
forest that we

417
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,918
we are guests in nature and everybody is

418
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,279
expected to act

419
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:02,480
as such we have three

420
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,080
main camping areas this year we've had

421
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,159
to scale down a bit because of the

422
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,678
financial situation so

423
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,360
some of the stuff you saw last year and

424
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,960
some of the stuff that we will

425
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,959
have next year if we're operating at

426
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,080
full capacity we simply couldn't afford

427
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,120
this year

428
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,520
so the the the areas we have are the the

429
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,199
big

430
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,360
general camping area that's by the info

431
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,240
desk the the

432
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,678
biggest camping area here it's called

433
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,039
general camping because it's just

434
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,559
there's nothing uh

435
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,520
nothing no particular requirements or

436
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,360
anything to to

437
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,120
you can just put up your tent and have a

438
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,240
nice time there

439
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,639
and down by the behind the food area is

440
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,840
the

441
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,600
noisy area and if you like to combine

442
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,639
camping with the loudspeakers and

443
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,639
especially

444
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,720
if you like to turning them up loud then

445
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,080
that's the place for you

446
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,840
you are allowed to make noise in the

447
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,720
noisy area it is conveniently down

448
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,039
between two

449
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,480
two hills so most of the noise don't go

450
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,840
to the neighbors but

451
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,760
keep it still within a reasonable level

452
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,279
we don't want to bother neighbours even

453
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
though they are far away from the noisy

454
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,240
area

455
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,640
noise still travels especially at night

456
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,559
and we don't want angry neighbors

457
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,559
so party away play all the music you

458
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:18,080
want but

459
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:20,399
within uh you know not in the same level

460
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,399
please

461
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,840
where we had the family and the the

462
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,760
quiet area last year we have

463
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,439
not been able to to find it in the

464
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,520
budget to get infrastructure down there

465
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,480
so there's no power and there's no wi-fi

466
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,080
there's still running water but but no

467
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,120
power and wi-fi and you're very welcome

468
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,199
to camp there but

469
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,719
but expect no coverage but if you're

470
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,480
only looking for a place to sleep and

471
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,400
that'll probably be

472
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,400
the quietest place on the venue

473
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,120
the parking area if you have a parking

474
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,559
ticket it's

475
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,559
on the left when you drove into the

476
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,000
venue it's hard to miss there's a bunch

477
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,600
of cars there and there's a sign

478
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,120
pointing to it you need a parking ticket

479
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,320
it's a hundred cronus

480
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:04,799
and please park

481
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
in a sensible way down there and not so

482
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,720
we don't have to

483
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,719
have people move around

484
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,719
we have a bunch of fireplaces on the

485
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,480
venue it is uh

486
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,080
permitted to build a fire there you

487
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,000
don't need a you don't need to ask

488
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,080
anybody you go right ahead we love

489
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,480
bonfires but we absolutely want to keep

490
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,639
them

491
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,240
in the designated fireplaces they are

492
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,559
the orange markers on the map

493
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,320
there's four of them here and a couple

494
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,360
of them are really big and the other two

495
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,678
are not so big but

496
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,199
they are they are there for the use and

497
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,960
we would love to see some

498
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,600
some bonfires around the venue

499
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,640
finally by behind the info desk is the

500
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,840
orga village

501
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,679
it is a where we have all our stuff

502
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,520
where we drive around with the

503
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,039
electric car and do stuff and we have

504
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,320
meetings and it's also where the organ

505
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,120
people live

506
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,799
and we're not just organ we're also here

507
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,479
to enjoy ourselves and we we

508
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,320
also need a bit of privacy from now and

509
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,360

523
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,399
team has done an amazing job

524
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,320
this year getting everything ready he

525
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,840
truly is a one-man army so

526
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,039
he's worthy of getting many beers and

527
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,000
hails

528
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,120
when the nightfalls go around and watch

529
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,279
it and while i remember

530
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,719
there is a mercedes media shower this

531
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,240
evening and if it's

532
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,159
there's no clouds you should be able to

533
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,279
see a lot of shooting stars

534
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:52,559
so it's if you want

535
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,720
that sort of thing right

536

oh we haven't done all the boring stuff

537

uh there is the

538
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,879
the little nasty black creatures cortex

539
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,919

543
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,559

544
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,480
of caring that the chick-bone and

545
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,678

police and

644
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,639

697
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,399
this year getting the

698
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,320
fiber from a global connect uh point of

699
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,279
presence about 500 meters from here

700
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,480
across

701
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,840
a big road up a flagpole over the road

702
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,440
down another flagpole

703
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,199
and then in through a garden and in

704
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,399
through a forest over a hill and up

705
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,559
through the nature area

706

to the little building by the food area

709
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,279
where our network core is

710
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,880
they've distributed network access

711
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,320
points all over the venue if you want

712
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,000
ethernet you can just leave your cable

713
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,960
and it'll be plugged in

714
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,960
and if you

715
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,080
if you want wi-fi there's a few

716
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,840
different ssids

717
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,679
and i've been encouraged to ask you to

718
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,960
use small bandwidth because we're not

719
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,918
using all the the bandwidth we have so

720
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,240
please knock yourselves out go right

721
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,239
ahead

722
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,879
i don't want to know what you're using

723
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,079
it for at all

724
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,598
um the uplink is uh sponsored by

725
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,079
uh bonfire and it goes

726
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,720
through a global connect the the fiber

727
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,359
itself

728
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,480
the physical link it is terminated at

729
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,399
bone fiber

730
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,639
in household stop and it is routed

731
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,520
through the internet via cdc

732
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,040
we have a permanent ipv6 allocation and

733
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,480
we have a

734
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,960
borrowed or ipv4 allocation

735
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,679
from from ripe both are routed through

736
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,359
our own

737
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,520
as number it is all lovely on the on the

738
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,040
public wi-fi you get a public ip there's

739
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,400
no firewall or anything so make sure you

740
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,279
have that but you should have that

741
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,880
anyway

742
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,400
regardless of which network you connect

743
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,440
to uh the other 802.1x has uh the fancy

744
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,599
auth where you get the

745
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,119
individual uh encryption for your

746
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,320
instead of wpa

747
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,520
or clear text and the bonheck

748
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,480
net is for like tablets and stuff

749
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,880
where you would like to have uh the kind

750
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,480
of

751
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,079
protection you get from a normal net

752
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,560
router at home where there's no ports

753
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,760
open

754
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,320
inbound so you can uh lock your

755
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,400
tablet or phone on the wi-fi without

756
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,040
risking too much

757
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,880
right and then our team would of course

758
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,920
love to to hear about problems i'll help

759
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,320
you if you have

760
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,320
questions

761
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,920
okay so we have we of course generate

762
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,599
a lot of garbage and we consume a lot of

763
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,280
liquids in the heat and that generates

764
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,720
some empty bottles and cans

765
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,920
and we are trying hard to label our

766
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,640
trash cans so we

767
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,079
get it soldered properly there's a trans

768
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,839
bins for regular trash

769
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,520
and then there's one for plastic bottles

770
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,200
and cans they go in one

771
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,880
and it's only if they have the danish

772
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,640
vat logo and it says

773
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,000
it has the logo on the trashcan so if

774
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,118
you don't see that little

775
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,040
circular arrow with the uh

776
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,400
you can see the logo easily then please

777
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,119
don't put it in because we will have to

778
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,839
stand

779
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,920
by hand and sold this after so and that

780
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:25,599
it was a it was a big toll on a couple

781
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,040
of the organizers last year

782
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,079
we've tried to label it more carefully

783
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,800
this year when we say cans we mean

784
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,280
cans with the vet logo not a tomato can

785
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,040
or

786
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:39,359
stuff like that i realize this can be

787
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,160
i mean not all countries have the same

788
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,200
vat and

789
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,040
return system but we this is what we

790
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,640
we have in denmark and we try to use it

791
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,920
as much if we can

792
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,240
then there's another bin for glass

793
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,240
bottles with that they go to different

794
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,799
containers back to our vat processing

795
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,359
company

796
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,800
so please don't mix them and then a

797
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,279
couple of pins for regular trash

798
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,040
if you see a full pin please beep the qr

799
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,720
code and select this is full or needs

800
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,759
emptying or whatever the option is

801
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,439
or inform the info desk if you don't see

802
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,280
a qr code or can't be bothered

803
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,880
doing it electronically we want to know

804
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,560
anyway but we would love to get all the

805
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,440
feedback standardized on this system so

806
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,759
we can easily

807
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,320
manage it and have some stats on it and

808
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,320
stuff like that

809
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,560

846
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,078
they can be used at the info desk to buy

847
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,400
stuff or at the food vendor

848
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,760
singular we only have one this year but

849
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
he is promising to be

850
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,599
very nice i went there twice today and

851
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,200
i'm very happy

852
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,200
and of course in the bar

853
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,920
they look yeah you've probably seen them

854
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,680
or you will see them very soon they are

855
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,839
brightly colored plastic tokens and they

856
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,720
correspond to two danish chronos so if

857
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,119
something is

858
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,000
is 25 hex in the bar it would be 25

859
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,000
kroners

860
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,760
if we didn't have the hex system

861
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,599
and if you're wondering why then have

862
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,440
the system then

863
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,440
i can explain it some other time

864
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,799
okay as promised a few teams

865
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,680
still need help the info team like i

866
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,440
said they

867
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,118
they have been hit hard by some missing

868
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,000
organizers they would love for some

869
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,440
people to uh

870
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,960
to be able to to uh

871
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,200
to help them so they can leave the info

872
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,119
desk once in a while

873
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,799
and the the video team is uh

874
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,359
particularly important this year because

875
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,359
we have

876
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,200
low capacity in the speaker's tent so

877
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,078
it's important that all the talks

878
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,919
all speakers who want to get recorded

879
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,640
can get recorded and that requires some

880
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,400
people

881
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,240
to join the video team so they don't

882
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,119
have to sit up here all day every day

883
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,560
the the members they do have so it is uh

884
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,520
pretty easy you get a

885
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,880
thorough introduction and and as a bonus

886
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,720
you get to see a lot of talks

887
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,000
so if you intend to see talks anyway why

888
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,919
not sit behind the camera

889
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,400
and help your fellow hackers that

890
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,640
couldn't fit in the speaker's tent

891
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,160
i'm told that it's a it's an easy intro

892
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,920
and that it's

893
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,799
it's absolutely manageable work great

894
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,480
okay the bad team still needs a few

895
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,760
people so if you uh

896
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,480
know how to attend ba in a especially in

897
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,760
a

898
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,000
in a hygienic way in these times then

899
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,560
sarah would love to hear from you i

900
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
think they need two people still

901
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,920
uh the food area team i think they are

902
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,119
finishing up down there but they have

903
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,280
uh they have they have needed

904
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,560
some help during the day so if if you go

905
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,040
there and see people working

906
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,920
maybe offer your help to get it to get

907
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,319
it finished up

908
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,359
and or the last will be done tomorrow

909
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,880
but

910
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,560
but the food area for if you haven't

911
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,000
been here before is uh

912
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,599
is where you can cook your own food and

913
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
it's also where the food vendor is we

914
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:06,160
have

915
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,680
fridges available there's still a lot of

916
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,000
fridge shelves free so you can

917
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,200
rent one on the website you can go buy

918
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,640
groceries put your

919
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,720
food in the fridge and light up a

920
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,839
barbecue or a gas

921
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,200
powered stove to cook your food and do

922
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,560
the dishes when you're done like you

923
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:23,919
would at home but

924
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,920
in a group of hackers maybe

925
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,359
it's a way to to we know you have

926
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,680
varying diets

927
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,799
and and some people just like to to cook

928
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,200
and like to

929
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,000
to hack food and and we of course want

930
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,480
to uh to

931
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
support all we can we even have a fridge

932
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,800
down there for food sharing and some

933
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,160
shelves

934
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,079
so if you have something you know you're

935
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,720
not going to use then put it in the free

936
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,319
shelf

937
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,560
in the free fridge on the shelves and

938
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:49,440
and also use the food we we want to

939
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,078
minimize food

940
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,800
waste as much as possible and and not

941
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,359
all people

942
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,920
come here with the same budget so have

943
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,000
some

944
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,599
rice or whatever leftover put it on the

945
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,200
shelves i'm sure somebody will

946
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,599
will love to eat it

947
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,560
the sanitation team colloquy

948
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,200

called team shit also needs help they

950
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,040
don't actually deal with

951
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,720
with shit that much it's mainly emptying

952
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,000
the garbage bags

953
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,160
but it is i mean it is taking shit

954
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,040

955
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,200
uh

956
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,720
it has the added bonus of uh riding

957
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,680
around in the electric

958
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,399

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,399
replace garbage bags with the

962
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,319
full with empty and uh and drive around

963
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,560
in a vest

964
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,520
playing they see me rolling in the

965
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,680

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,560
you know a reason reasonable number of

1015
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,400
years ago

1016
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,920
then then please we could use your help

1017
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,760
you'll get a shift and you'll have

1018
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,640
maybe eight hours where you have a radio

1019
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,520
and a bike and a vest and you'll just

1020
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,960
be ready to respond if anything happens

1021
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,160
it is a

1022
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,200
very low stress job with occasional

1023
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,960
uh high stress peaks but uh but

1024
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,040
mostly and especially with this low

1025
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,119
number of people there won't be

1026
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,920
an insane amount of work it will be

1027
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,960
ticks and splinters mostly

1028
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,040
um so noon towards 12 30 tomorrow in the

1029
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,880
workshop rooms if you're interested in

1030
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,119
helping out the third team and helping

1031
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:08,400
out your fellow hackers feel safe

1032
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,119
okay the photo team they will also wear

1033
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,240
orange vests to uh to distinguish

1034
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,760
themselves from

1035
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,078
from the from the organizers they

1036
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,040
respect the code of conduct which says

1037
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,200
among other things

1038
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,440
to not take pictures without everybody

1039
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,279
in the picture

1040
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,040
uh previously having agreed for the

1041
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,800
picture to be taken which means

1042
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:31,520
basically no crowd pictures because it's

1043
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,560
just there's too much logistics in

1044
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,319
asking everybody so i mean we all want

1045
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,078
to document our wonderful experiences

1046
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:40,000
and we all want to share

1047
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,440
stuff with people at home but if you

1048
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,640
take pictures make sure there's no

1049
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,640
people on them or

1050
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,759
you've asked the people on the pictures

1051
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,680
beforehand

1052
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,839
and that of course also goes for our

1053
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,680
photo team we of course would love to

1054
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,440
have some awesome pictures put to put on

1055
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,319
our website and in our

1056
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,200
materials and flyers and stuff and the

1057
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,880
photo team has

1058
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,200
of course been briefed about this and

1059
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,079
they will ask everybody in a picture

1060
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,000
unless they

1061
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,359
know beforehand i mean if they've asked

1062
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,079
before and they know everybody in the

1063
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:09,119
picture

1064
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,680
is okay with it then they won't but but

1065
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,800
they will

1066
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,160
follow these rules if you have questions

1067
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,240
you're welcome to ask the

1068
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,279
the photo team people and see their

1069
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,598
pictures if you

1070
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,560
are not sure if you were included in it

1071
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,720
we we

1072
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,759
fully respect people's privacy and and

1073
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,279
also are not

1074
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,800
crazy ourselves about having our

1075
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,480
pictures taken without

1076
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,680
without our consent or permit so

1077
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,920
so yes of course we will respect this

1078
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,598
but that being said if you don't mind

1079
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,119
then please allow the photo team to to

1080
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,960
take pictures of you because there's so

1081
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,560
many cool situations in an event like

1082
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,319
this and people doing cool stuff

1083
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,319
and it is so hard to document without

1084
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:49,359
getting people's faces

1085
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,160
so if you don't really mind then please

1086
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,880
allow them to

1087
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,879
to take pictures

1088
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,759
okay we there was a deadline for

1089
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,480
ordering merchandise uh

1090
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,680
some days back uh and if you missed it

1091
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,240
there is still a little bit

1092
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,799
uh available in the web shop not many

1093
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,919
pieces

1094
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,520
of each size but a few and uh and if you

1095
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,880
hurry you can get it and if not when

1096
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:13,280
it's sold out it's sold out we're not

1097
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,960
going to get any more

1098
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,760
delivered or anything like that there's

1099
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,520
no late late order or second badge

1100
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,240
and and there's no mailing merchandise

1101
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,800
to people because it's too much work

1102
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,279
so we have some in the wake shop if you

1103
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,280
haven't

1104
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,160
ordered what you want then i suggest you

1105
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,720
go do it immediately after this

1106
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,839
it will be available uh from friday

1107
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,399
afternoon

1108
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,520
is the goal right now and the the people

1109
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,559
producing it might

1110
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:42,400
adjust that later but uh but friday is a

1111
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,520
good bet

1112
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,559
badges should be available tomorrow from

1113
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,720
10 in the the info desk we

1114
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,240
are still not entirely clear if they are

1115
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,319
going to be free this year because we

1116
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,078
haven't found a bad sponsor and we are

1117
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,720
pretty pressed financially so they might

1118
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,480
cost

1119
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,078
50 or 100 kroners or hex but we actually

1120
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,680
don't quite know yet but they will be

1121
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,760
available tomorrow

1122
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,279
from from noon whatever the price but

1123
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,880
hopefully they will be free like they've

1124
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,960
been the other years and we will

1125
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,800
sort out the financial stuff later um

1126
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,480
that's my hope but i honestly don't know

1127
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,240
and i'm the person who should know

1128
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,720
uh i just haven't had time to actually

1129
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,439
sit down and take a good long look at

1130
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,640
the

1131
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,720
at the finances so

1132
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,240
remember to attend the the batch talk

1133
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,000
tomorrow it's at one

1134
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:32,000
to two and it is uh usually lots of fun

1135
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
to hear how our bases are produced and

1136
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,599
what kind of hacking options it has i

1137
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,680
hear this

1138
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,680
i hear many interesting things about it

1139
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,879
this year and i'm very excited about it

1140
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,799
but i will let

1141
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,079
the batch team have been doing an

1142
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,079
immense amount of work

1143
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,599
to get everything working especially

1144
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,520
working around corona

1145
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,280
delivery restrictions and deadlines and

1146
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,559
stuff getting stuff in from

1147
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,800
various countries and china in

1148
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,680
particular is uh is tricky to say the

1149
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,680
least

1150
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,118
and um and they have gotten them

1151
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,598
produced and they are working and they

1152
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,119
are

1153
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,960
looking awesome and the feature set

1154
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:06,160
seems awesome but i'll let them

1155
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,839
uh won't bother the surprises so uh show

1156
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,319
up tomorrow or stream it

1157
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,920
and if you if you don't have really feel

1158
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,880
strong feelings for a talk consider

1159
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,119
staying

1160
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,720
at home in your attend with a laptop and

1161
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,760
then having your fellow uh

1162
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,480
leaving the space for your fellow

1163
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,839
hackers we have 60 seats here and 150

1164
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,160
people in the venue

1165
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:24,880
and there will of course always be a few

1166
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,279
people uh

1167
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,480
who can't go so so think twice before

1168
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,520
you go up here we want to see

1169
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,720
a full send of course but we we you know

1170
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,440
what i mean

1171
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,598
consider consider leaving a space

1172
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,440
sometimes

1173
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:42,079
and remember the batch talk tomorrow

1174
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,079
it's that one

1175
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,680
right i got to the end of my slides

1176
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,680
i uh have a couple of things that i

1177
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:52,160
didn't have time to put in them

1178
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,919
because we were we i got here pretty

1179
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,040
late uh before this

1180
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:59,440
so um bear with me they are not in any

1181
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,040
particular order and i also need to

1182
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,040
pass my own riding so

1183
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,799
right the power team like i said we

1184
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,839
haven't had

1185
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,839
the the budget to to stretch the power

1186
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:14,558
installations all the way to the to what

1187
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,400
is now the nature area

1188
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,160
this also means that we have some long

1189
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,839
stretches of cable and this means that

1190
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,759
there will be voltage drops around the

1191
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,000
venue particularly if anybody's powering

1192
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,440
up anything uh particularly power hungry

1193
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,920
at the moment

1194
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,040
we've heard reports of as low as 180

1195
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,359
volts which is

1196
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,359
fine

1197
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,000
we know it's not perfect but for normal

1198
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,680
i mean for your laptops and stuff it

1199
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,520
doesn't matter at all a few things will

1200
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,078
have problems but most devices will not

1201
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,400
have a problem

1202
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,000
at all and i mean it is what it is it is

1203
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,800
what we could afford so i'm sure we will

1204
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,319
make it work

1205
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,160
if you have something important that

1206
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:50,079
doesn't work then

1207
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,279
go to the cabin and plug it in power

1208
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,800
should be fine there but

1209
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,240
i mean you can charge your laptops and

1210
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,119
your phones and you can get light in

1211
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,040
your tents and

1212
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,720
and stuff and that is with the budget

1213
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,880
the power team has had this year it is

1214
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,040
nothing short of a fucking miracle what

1215
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:09,839
they've done so they deserve a huge

1216
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,839
round of applause

1217
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,240
so yeah a low voltage here and there

1218
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,640
that is absolutely excused

1219
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:22,078
um and jumping straight into something

1220
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,960
completely different like i said

1221
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,040
uh when you take a cup from the bar

1222
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,720
please bring it back

1223
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,160
i know it's a kind of random to say on

1224
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,160
the first day but but we

1225
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,359
they already kind of detected a pattern

1226
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,440
so if you do

1227
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:37,200
get a get a draft beer and walk off with

1228
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:38,800
it you're welcome to do that but

1229
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,160
the classes need to find their way back

1230
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,680
because we don't have an unlimited

1231
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,078
supply even with this amount of

1232
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:49,279
participants we still have room for

1233
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,040
lightning talks so if anybody

1234
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,800
maybe hasn't done a talk before that's a

1235
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,960
great way to get started

1236
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,880
if you have a bit of stage right it's

1237
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,960
only five minutes you can do it about

1238
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,640
anything at all it literally doesn't

1239
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,160
matter it just has to be something

1240
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,720
you are passionate about and it's a

1241
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,640
great way to get started on a stage is

1242
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,359
how i and i think most people

1243
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,799
started out with a small oh i'm gonna go

1244
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:13,119
say something because i really

1245
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,480
need to get this off my chest and talk

1246
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,160
about a project or

1247
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,720
something i discovered while debugging

1248
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,799
something or whatever it might be

1249
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:22,959
and and before you know it you will be

1250
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,720
doing uh

1251
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,720
regular talks you might also have a

1252
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,879
regular talk or not but

1253
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,640
you just have something that that isn't

1254
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,920
a big enough subject for a regular talk

1255
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,118
that's a perfect candidate for a

1256
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,400
lightning talk

1257
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,800
so they can be submitted on the website

1258
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,400
through the regular channels and i'm

1259
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,599
told that the lightning talks have been

1260
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,960
scheduled

1261
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:48,240
later i don't know what day

1262
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,520
or what time but later in the week

1263
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,359
um right then i have the the media

1264
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:55,280
shower but i already mentioned that

1265
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:56,720
remember to to look up if i don't know

1266
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,319
if there's a cloud cover but

1267
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,319
the the rest of the evenings have had

1268
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:03,759
beautiful beautiful

1269
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:05,200
cloudless starry skies so

1270
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,839
let's hope it's like that again this

1271
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,919
year and i also mentioned

1272
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,440
the speaker's tent don't crowd up

1273
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,920
outside if you don't have

1274
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,280
room to get in and get a seat then

1275
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,000
please go back down and turn on the

1276
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,520
stream

1277
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,520
on your laptop or go to one of the

1278
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,880
places maybe we'll get some streaming up

1279
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:23,119
in the bar if you want to

1280
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,160
take that job and and put up a screen

1281
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,119
and some stream

1282
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,558
streaming stuff please do so like i said

1283
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:29,680
if you see a room for improvement and

1284
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,400
you feel like you're able to do

1285
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,399
something

1286
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,599
go to the info desk and or just catch

1287
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,960
your vest and

1288
