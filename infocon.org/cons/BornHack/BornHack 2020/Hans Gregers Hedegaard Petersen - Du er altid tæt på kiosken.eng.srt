1
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,520
okay

2
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,198
so uh yes i'm greg

3
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,280
and i'm here to tell you that you are

4
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,680
always near a shop

5
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,320
uh and uh it's a

6
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,199
it's a it's a talk in in two parts the

7
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,560
first part

8
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:32,320
is about the free danish

9
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,840
basic data and uh bear with me while we

10
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,960
walk through these

11
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,599
uh different types of of of data you

12
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,919
have here

13
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,479
i promise you after you walk out of this

14
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,639
tent you are able to make

15
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,560
or visualize spoken geography better

16
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:52,720
than than i am

17
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:55,840
at least that's the point here

18
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
and if i could just

19
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,318
i'm switching slides here but not there

20
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,280
so for the first part it's about basic

21
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
data program

22
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,479
in in denmark and which kind of data

23
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,199
are free and what we can do now

24
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,599
this starts to smell a bit but what we

25
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,600
could

26
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,120
do since 2013 but

27
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,960
which is more and more enabled now and

28
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
part two is about geography in life and

29
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,919
law

30
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,360
and i'm very scared to see that rasmus

31
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
is here so you can correct me about the

32
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
law but i'll talk about

33
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,280
my understanding of how we we have been

34
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,039
speaking about geography

35
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,679
and the last part is bringing words to

36
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,960
the map and part two is

37
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,160
generally about my little example of

38
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,719
illustrating

39
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,160
[Music]

40
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,599
how easy it is to say let's surveil

41
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,919
anything up to 200 meters from from any

42
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,680
danish company and how this turns out to

43
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,520
be it's only 200 meters

44
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,240
it turns into whoa this is all of

45
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,440
denmark actually

46
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,840
yes and from a company called the septum

47
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,840
we're

48
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,679
small we started out with the three

49
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,880
basic data we

50
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
are 20 employees now we started out

51
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
seven

52
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,280
guys in in 2013.

53
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:22,400
my daytime job is helping the government

54
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,679
pull taxes out of all of you by

55
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,479
by making these data and some more into

56
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,800
evaluations

57
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,840
or evaluations of property in denmark

58
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
amongst other

59
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,080
so what is this basic data of course

60
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,719
it's a program because everything

61
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,318
in government is is part of a program

62
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,280
it's just a project it's not big enough

63
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:50,400
so this is a big program

64
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:53,599
and the first thing was agreeing

65
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,120
what is basic data actually so we have

66
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,840
various core information about

67
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,800
individuals about your property

68
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,239
about your business about your address

69
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,759
anything really

70
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,520
and all this is the foundation of our

71
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,599
society that's why we call it basic data

72
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,120
but nothing makes the wheel turn around

73
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,159
like money so we had to

74
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,039
or they had to find out in 2012

75
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,319
that the basic data is also financing

76
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,599
because before

77
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,800
the first of january 2013 most of

78
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,719
these datasets were paid for by

79
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,479
one student so one one entity of the

80
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,200
danish government paying another stool

81
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,440
to

82
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,800
to to make these data so a third student

83
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
could collect the data and the fourth

84
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,519
students who could interpret it

85
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,239
so it's they found out hey let's save

86
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
about

87
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,680
two and a half billion uh kroners a year

88
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,240
by not

89
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,040
uh invoicing each other so it's also

90
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,040
about financing

91
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,920
and this sounds crazy to anyone in in

92
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,920
within data modeling but they found out

93
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,360
it's important to link data

94
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,760
or being able to link data so when you

95
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,040
tell let's say the one one one two

96
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,800
operator

97
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,640
in in copenhagen if you live in

98
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,560
copenhagen you call the 112 operator the

99
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,040
first thing he sees is

100
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
is a map and we then help them find out

101
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,319
where you are

102
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,519
and then you say i'm at this and this

103
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,519
address

104
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,920
and until about 20 years ago he would

105
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,399
sit

106
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
with uh with a cox court well if all

107
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,040
danes know this

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:35,519
and say okay you're in 117

109
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,880
a2 but but now we can link actually the

110
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,240
addresses to the roads that might seem

111
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,240
like a big deal you don't seem impressed

112
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,240
but now they can link the addresses to

113
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,560
roads and they know how to drive

114
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,279
and this is also how we link real

115
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,959
property to to addresses to roads and to

116
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,560
to other stuff so it's linkability

117
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,399
then uh some of you might know the the

118
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,839
the idea that it was also about

119
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,279
distribution

120
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,279
i was a consultant on a big consulting

121
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,920
architect actually on the gu

122
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,040
part of a big big data distribution

123
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,160
platform

124
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,399
which became a huge success

125
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,760
delivered on time or maybe not

126
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,240
of after the eighth revision or so

127
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,439
so if you go to data for daily deco then

128
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,720
you should be able to see

129
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,440
at least yeah at least

130
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,800
some of these data the idea was that we

131
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
should be able to distribute it for free

132
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,479
to the to the people also

133
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,839
but most in my experience most

134
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,120
importantly this is

135
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,440
also about coordination um

136
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,120
it is to ensure efficient effective and

137
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,279
coordinate development

138
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,120
so we are we are actually doing some of

139
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,640
the same stuff so we can work together

140
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,680
and all of this is um important for

141
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,839
us as as users to be able to make what

142
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,599
you will see later

143
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,160
but let's switch to which data was

144
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
actually free

145
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,239
yeah so this is

146
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,560
king christian iv he's throwing out

147
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,000
money to the people to make them happy

148
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,959
and you can at least that's my

149
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,320
image of the the government back in 2012

150
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,199
or the whole of the parliament of

151
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
denmark

152
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,360
actually agreeing on something that the

153
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,480
free basic data was a good idea it's the

154
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
government throwing

155
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,120
money out or data out at the people and

156
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,518
you see me

157
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,720
trying to grab some of it from for

158
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,880
myself

159
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
and and our company and then you have

160
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,000
different people from poor to rich

161
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,319
who grab out for the money

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,200
what what did they throw on the street

163
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,160
they threw the data i had

164
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,480
been in love with for half a decade back

165
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,639
then

166
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,399
the most of this data i had produced in

167
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,240
another company

168
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,480
for a very lousy salary and had good

169
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,200
ideas of how to exploit them but every

170
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,240
time

171
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,120
i tried to i had a nasty

172
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,440
dream about the paying the the 12

173
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,600
million to to start up a project

174
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,480
so they shared geodata it was the

175
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,880
biggest amount

176
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,399
of data released was was the geodata

177
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,560
part so it's

178
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,800
basically anything within geo that's not

179
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,920
in defense

180
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,079
oh and the cmaps because maps of

181
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,680
the sea are used by big danish

182
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,279
shipping companies and it would be bad

183
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,719
for business but for danish business if

184
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,480
we shared them with anyone

185
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,399
everyone so it's geodata

186
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,399
it's technical maps it's hard models

187
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,120
it's hydro improved height models and so

188
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
forth that's all

189
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,920
the stuff we work with then it's company

190
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,920
data

191
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,200
so it's which companies do we have in

192
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,479
denmark and where do they produce

193
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:56,480
stuff and where are the main entities

194
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,350
where the sub entities whose owners

195
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,800
and so forth and then it's

196
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,519
[Music]

197
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,519
address data

198
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,560
um though they were already free

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:21,839
sorry it's the it's my daycare who's i

200
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,839
just have to

201
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,040
they'll call her mom

202
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,360
it's address data though they were

203
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,320
already

204
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,680
free and being distributed so it's it's

205
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,199
where are the the different addresses

206
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,120
when we say flexberger and hidden where

207
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,199
is that

208
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
and now from this year it's also weather

209
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,839
data

210
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,199
and actually this is a real conversation

211
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,160
between one of the partners in in our

212
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,800
company and me

213
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,719
said how can we exploit that lightning

214
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,479
observations are now free

215
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
so if you want to look at lightning then

216
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,399
it's uh the amount of lightning

217
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,839
and when it strikes and where it strikes

218
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
is now free

219
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,880
so all this turned into what can we do

220
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,920
now

221
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,720
well this is collection of the

222
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,560
industries men

223
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,000
now we can do private business and

224
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
everyone can start up

225
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
what they want in their basement if they

226
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,320
want you don't need to produce 12

227
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,040
million crowners to be able to read the

228
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,839
geodata

229
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,839
that your tax is already paid for

230
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,160
you can enrich your own data sets

231
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,639
this is me calculating where water flows

232
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,439
for an

233
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,120
insurance company and for myself when i

234
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,399
was buying a house

235
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,160
i don't want to live where the water

236
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,160
goes preferably where it goes from

237
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,680
and you can combine several different

238
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,399
data sources

239
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,880
this is if a gasoline truck turns over

240
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
this

241
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,639
is what we sell to the to the one one

242
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,160
two for instance when a gasoline truck

243
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,320
uh topples over

244
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,240
in the middle of a of a town where

245
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,760
should you protect water

246
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,680
so it's for environmental protection and

247
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,800
if it's gasoline probably also for

248
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,479
property protection and

249
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,880
since there's a lot of data you can also

250
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,880
do this

251
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,759
i put it in quotations because as a

252
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:39,279
former statistician i hate big data

253
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:42,079
it's it's not a word it's not a thing

254
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,480
it's simply a big amount but you can do

255
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,880
real big data

256
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,240
we turn around uh when we do a

257
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,000
calculation on the danish height model

258
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,079
we turn around

259
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,360
10 to 15 terabytes of data when we do

260
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,359
one run of denmark

261
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,360
so it's it's really big data

262
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,639
then we should almost have had was a lot

263
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,120
here

264
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,759
now the private initiative can actually

265
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,079
try

266
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,040
to to to take the risk and doing stuff

267
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,880
without

268
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,480
being thought of by some public admin

269
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
guy saying

270
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,480
i want something and that's why i could

271
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,920
make this stuff you'll see later

272
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,360
and then actually what's what's

273
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,719
happening right now is we test a lot of

274
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,360
ideas

275
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,920
and we create and sell as a company we

276
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,920
create and sell the added value

277
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,680
but before anything you had to do you

278
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,399
had to get permission either either

279
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,560
go with the money 12 to 13 million uh

280
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,920
cronus to to

281
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,839
to the government pay for they say all

282
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,399
come with a good idea and they hopefully

283
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,759
wouldn't steal it for themselves but try

284
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,480
to to finance you

285
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,759
and then we get beta data i shouldn't be

286
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,440
a surprise for you but this

287
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:02,639
uh when people work together

288
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,240
usually people actually behave

289
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,880
rather well they help each other and

290
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,480
there's a quite a good story about the

291
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
danish address data being shit

292
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,000
but open street members uh

293
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,119
helping with with heightening that the

294
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,400
quality to

295
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,559
around 99.9 good addresses instead of

296
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,079
95 because the rest there wasn't any

297
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,359
economy in

298
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,359
in making the rest better

299
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,039
then you get then this is the the slide

300
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,080
that probably

301
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,400
uh will uh

302
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,559
infuriate some of the public admin guys

303
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,760
then the people will get better insight

304
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,440
i don't know if you can see it but it's

305
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,000
from the from the quest for the holy

306
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,799
grail and this communist peasant

307
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,360
questioning if the king is right and now

308
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,918
we're

309
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,678
moving towards the main part of the

310
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,840
of the talk today because it is the

311
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,240
right of the people to question

312
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,639
if the king is right but before you had

313
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
to pay

314
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,280
let's say if it's it's my case i use

315
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,280
both

316
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,559
i use data for around 45 million chronos

317
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,000
pre 1st of january 2013 it wouldn't

318
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,399
i wouldn't be able to make what i've

319
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,919
made with with the surveillance

320
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,600
camera oversight without paying upfront

321
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,799
40 million

322
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,719
and i can promise you i wouldn't have

323
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,639
done it if i were to pay

324
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,280
40 million so the people get better

325
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,960
insight

326
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,960
and that leads us to the next slide

327
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,799
we see this a lot we gave them so much

328
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,240
and now they're angry

329
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,320
because it's specialist data

330
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,880
you need to interpret it you need to be

331
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,480
able to understand that something

332
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,400
some things are wrong even in our

333
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,559
most holy data sets such as the the

334
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,760
danish matrix who owns what

335
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,879
things will be wrong and previously we

336
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,879
were protected by

337
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,919
uh either lawyers or chartered surveyors

338
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,360
who were able to

339
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,280
interpret the data and say oh this is

340
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,760
clearly wrong so let's make it right

341
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,480
whenever a problem came but now when you

342
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,000
go to

343
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,520
let's say boliga or one of the other

344
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,400
real estate sites and you see something

345
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,559
is wrong then you

346
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,559
start shitting your pens and

347
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,000
the sellers are angry and the buyers are

348
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,639
angry and actually it took me

349
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,440
around three months of of negotiation

350
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,799
with the

351
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,600
the buyer of our previous flats attorney

352
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,160
to to agree that my flat was to the

353
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,000
right

354
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,520
even though one of three

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,760
official registers said it was to the

356
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,760
left

357
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,280
and people will become angry when they

358
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,879
get inside that's kind of the idea

359
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,399
but it causes a lot of frustration out

360
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,440
there and and one needs to know that

361
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,240
when

362
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,600
when calling someone and saying this is

363
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,039
wrong

364
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,840
and he'll just sigh and say i know

365
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,840
please kill me

366
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,879
then to the most interesting part for

367
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,840
today

368
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,480
now you had an overflight of the danish

369
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,760
basic

370
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,240
data and we'll go to geography in life

371
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,240
and law

372
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,400
because we all walk around using

373
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,039
geography

374
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:37,600
every day but vocally

375
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,840
so if none of you had the address here

376
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,678
my guess is you would have quite a hard

377
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,360
time getting here

378
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,000
so we have to agree on where are we

379
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,199
and we use vocal descriptions for that

380
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,360
sometimes we write them down but

381
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,799
basically is vocal descriptions

382
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,320
so some of the earliest would be

383
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,480
or the most general would be it's an

384
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,960
hour to the east and then people say

385
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,559
whoa

386
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,919
okay if you're from the extreme northern

387
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,360
part of jutland like me then you know

388
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,520
it's about 60 kilometers to the east

389
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,600
but if you're in copenhagen you're going

390
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,320
to walk the distance because an hour to

391
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,399
the east and

392
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,399
that's four or five kilometers at most

393
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,799
so it's uh interpretable

394
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,120
when you use a vocal description you

395
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,720
might say my property ends at the fence

396
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,039
then you're lucky if no one moves the

397
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,039
fence

398
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,919
and basically the danish property

399
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,919
real property is

400
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,120
in denmark defined as the natural

401
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,520
seeings in in nature so if the maps are

402
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,039
wrong

403
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,720
that's the previous errors then the

404
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,559
charters aware would go out and say but

405
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,360
but it says that your property ends

406
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,840
by the stream thus it ends by the stream

407
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,918
and we'll measure it now and it's most

408
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,039
probably within a few centimeters

409
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,600
correct

410
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,080
but it's still we still have parts of

411
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,799
the

412
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,678
the property register that's that are uh

413
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,000
predates

414
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,000
today by a couple of hundred if not

415
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,760
three or four hundred years

416
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,240
and it's it's quite a problem trying to

417
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,679
digitize these things

418
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,280
because when you digitize then you have

419
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,720
to

420
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,879
or you don't have to but if you don't

421
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,720
want to spend gazillions of cronus then

422
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,880
you have to make some decisions on who

423
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,240
is going to cry and who is going to

424
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,640
laugh

425
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,000
so um my property ends at the fence

426
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,440
and then you have to walk an hour to the

427
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,440
east or maybe ride who knows

428
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,880
then there's another problem with uh

429
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,640
with how we

430
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,760
do do

431
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:46,400
descriptions of geography this is an old

432
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,760
map of my home parish a parish map

433
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,400
and to avoid having a one-to-one size

434
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,799
map

435
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,120
we usually draw maps a bit smaller than

436
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,799
the real scaled world

437
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,600
and hence when you have a pencil that is

438
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:04,879
half a millimeter wide it suddenly

439
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,280
becomes several meters in nature

440
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,960
so here we see a part of who owns what

441
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,399
in in syndal

442
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,320
and the the beautiful things about the

443
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,760
old maps is that you can go and see how

444
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,039
things have changed

445
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,158
so for instance at some point

446
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,080
someone dared to build a railroad in the

447
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,480
southeastern corner

448
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,520
so the whole of the town was moved down

449
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,960
there

450
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,720
and suddenly i don't know if you can see

451
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,559
it but there is a road

452
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:39,120
drawn afterwards here

453
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,760
which the king stole from the people and

454
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,959
said now there is a road

455
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:50,559
and who knows if this road truly is

456
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,279
20 meters wide as it is on this drawing

457
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,158
i my guess is it's not and i've i've

458
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,440
been there

459
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,000
so but but the whole idea about how wide

460
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,600
is a pen

461
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
is that suddenly you get the brown

462
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,120
scripture in the right that's the change

463
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,840
of parish to another parish

464
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,320
if you live on the brown line where the

465
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,039
heck are you supposed to be

466
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,240
to the right to the left south or north

467
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,000
it no one

468
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,080
disagrees that this is the line between

469
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,960
parishes

470
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,520
and in modern politics you might even

471
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,720
see

472
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,039
uh see a a pdf scan of of a

473
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,559
of an ordinary pen drawn this is the

474
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,760
area want to

475
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,039
do something too and then

476
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,799
the the poor poor guy sitting in the

477
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,559
technical milieu office has to tell the

478
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,720
mayor but you have circled

479
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,200
an area of two square kilometers and the

480
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,640
pen you've used to circulate with

481
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,559
has marked an area of two square

482
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,880
kilometers what do you want to to

483
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:49,120
how much it's going to be with this

484
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,159
within this

485
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,199
so it's that's another thing and since

486
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,360
we draw to scale

487
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,360
everything will have kind of of a

488
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,840
of a width on the map

489
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,440
the biggest

490
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,080
problem is perhaps that words are

491
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,760
interpretable

492
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,840
so here we have a monk

493
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,679
writing down his drunk version of the

494
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,918
bible and then he decides to

495
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,720
suddenly put in on the 27th day he

496
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:26,320
created the experts

497
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,840
and going through seven or eight uh

498
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,918
10 of these types of monks then it's

499
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,480
suddenly changed to to this is what the

500
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,480
bible says

501
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,400
and every time you hear a word then you

502
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,400
interpret it in your own mind

503
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,159
so for example i heard that the the new

504
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,320
law states that you have to wear

505
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,600
your face mask in near the station

506
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,120
and then everyone says that's a good

507
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,639
idea of course it's a good idea but what

508
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,559
is near the station

509
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,320
then i have some juniors writing me greg

510
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,000
does the matrix the partial register of

511
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,600
denmark is that in 3d or will

512
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,679
any road passing under a station

513
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,399
actually be on the station

514
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,200
and i'd had to to sadly say to him yes

515
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,720
any

516
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,360
road or any path crossing a parcel in

517
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
denmark

518
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,120
which is owned by the the banister also

519
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,320
dsp is probably

520
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,600
at least geographically uh

521
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,639
near the station actually you're

522
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,399
probably on the station

523
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,880
and in those parts i come from where we

524
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,039
don't

525
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,000
develop that much we mostly remove

526
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,919
buildings

527
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,159
probably most of the town of cindel will

528
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,799
be honest an area owned by

529
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,799
by dsb

530
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,559
so words are interpretable and that's

531
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,600
just an example so it's easy

532
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,720
to say some things that sounds logical

533
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,799
when you say them but which become

534
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,720
quite interesting once you try to

535
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,720
visualize what what it actually is

536
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,640
and words are free

537
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,279
so when coming to the next part when

538
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
when nick says it's only 30 meters from

539
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,760
businesses

540
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,520
that can't be much then he's right if

541
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,000
you're standing outside the kiosk then

542
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,320
30 meters is 30 meters you can see

543
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,200
if you have an office where i i have

544
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,080
installed

545
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,120
in in denmark then you can see shops all

546
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,720
the way down soil

547
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,719
so it's 30 meters from everywhere

548
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,559
and then you can walk a bit out of the

549
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,080
town

550
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,559
and then it's still 30 meters because

551
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,639
it's not shops it seems to be businesses

552
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,799
they just have to have deliveries in and

553
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,799
out

554
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,880
and then you might say oh that that

555
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
really

556
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,840
greg that's not what he meant no that's

557
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,439
not what he meant but that's what he

558
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,959
wrote

559
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,880
and that's what we will come to for my

560
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,120
little visualization example here in

561
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,919
in the in the last part of my talk

562
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,719
so when uh nick says or any other that's

563
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,440
just because

564
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,279
uh i was uh punked by some friends to

565
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,279
say how much is this

566
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,399
after i've i've did it in in private

567
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,440
then some of the partners in the

568
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,719
community say you have to put this

569
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,679
online so people can see

570
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,240
because we fight with this every day

571
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,760
then

572
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,679
we'll go to the last part it's bringing

573
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,000
words to the map

574
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,000
so actually visualizing what you say

575
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,719
and when nick says 30 meters that's not

576
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,919
much then

577
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,279
greg says hmm 30 meters from all

578
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,080
businesses

579
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,440
and 30 meters from what is it the

580
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,480
address

581
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,559
is it the the parcel

582
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,919
is it the property and if it's the

583
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,120
property which types

584
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,640
of properties does this uh

585
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,080
actually uh are we actually going to

586
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,720
interpret this from because in denmark

587
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,918
we have

588
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,360
at least i was surprised the uh before

589
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,480
the the summer holidays that we have at

590
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,399
least

591
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,080
i knew we had at least three types of

592
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,600
properties in denmark or three

593
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,918
three different uh registers but

594
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,039
apparently we have

595
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,480
quite a bit more than three depending on

596
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,760
who you talk to if this

597
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,880
municipality the tax property evaluators

598
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,480
or

599
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,799
or who you're talking to but we'll get

600
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,760
back to that later but how much is this

601
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,760
actually and then

602
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:16,559
these slides are for your convenience

603
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,240
i took the danish businesses and the

604
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,760
location i'll just

605
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:25,200
if i may take this i took the danish

606
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,679
businesses and the location they're free

607
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,440
i managed to grab a hold of all the

608
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,919
three danish registers

609
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:38,799
of addresses and building parcels

610
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,720
and i loaded those into a huge

611
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,320
database cluster that we have or that's

612
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
not true we had it already on on the

613
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,039
cluster but let's let's say i collected

614
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,080
all these to see

615
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,279
is is nick right about

616
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,520
not being far from or that

617
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,880
the data coverage is far from all of

618
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,720
denmark

619
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,159
and that's how we we think when when we

620
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,240
do these kinds of analysis

621
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,360
if we're paid or if we're not if we

622
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,600
aren't it's uh

623
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,120
it's about trying to make the words uh

624
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:12,240
into something visual or into numbers

625
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,239
uh yeah

626
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,000
then there's a lot of open source

627
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,039
software that we use and that are used

628
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,840
for this

629
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,919
it's uh it's a postgres with the postgis

630
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,959
extension that is the most powerful if

631
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,640
you manage to write

632
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,440
sql that's the most powerful combination

633
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,640
you can do if you want to

634
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,840
to make anything with geography it's so

635
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,559
fast and it's

636
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,959
planner the sql planner in postgres are

637
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,960
is so

638
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,158
powerful that even if you manage to

639
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,440
write just a bit of sql then then you'll

640
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:51,360
see a result at some point

641
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,320
then i've used the free also qgi qgis

642
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,158
desktop gis system that's a geographical

643
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,559
information system

644
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,360
and later i i coupled it with the map

645
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:01,519
server for

646
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,519
for serving it and for that i used the

647
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,000
gta ogr extension

648
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,360
but this is the software you just

649
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,600
downloaded and make something smarter

650
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,279
than me

651
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:16,080
and then as we always do

652
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,760
we take on the actual words when someone

653
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,120
says can't we do this and how much is

654
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,799
that

655
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,799
so it took all danish companies

656
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,240
and they have a text address so i have

657
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,720
an algorithm that

658
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,960
converts the text addresses into a real

659
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,720
address so a uu id

660
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,200
to the address register

661
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,159
and then i coupled those i i even forgot

662
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,559
to to

663
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,600
to write that then i joined those so i

664
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,480
had the point of

665
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,080
of where companies are registered

666
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,600
and one could say going to the

667
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,918
illustrations later that this is where

668
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,080
the

669
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,840
the company lives and usually you'll see

670
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,519
these kinds of illustrations this is the

671
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,600
dot

672
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,880
and here greg and his wife and his

673
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,360
little daughter lives and they don't

674
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,360
move

675
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,199
outside this dot with no area because

676
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,000
this is their address

677
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,840
so that's that's the first illustration

678
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,159
one could make 30 meters from that

679
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,799
where the company is registered they're

680
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,399
allowed to film

681
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,158
but of course that's not what we mean

682
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,518
everyone knows that that's not

683
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,200
near the station that you're near the

684
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,000
address of the station

685
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,440
so we i did a special join to the

686
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,440
parcels in the danish matrix

687
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,399
so i coobled all the points and

688
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:35,519
specially said if you lay inside

689
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,239
a parcel then you the parcel becomes the

690
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,240
the company

691
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,679
and then i got all the buildings on the

692
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,279
parcels

693
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,440
because suddenly we needed those

694
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,080
also you'll see that later and when when

695
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,840
i pressed f5 as you do in the

696
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,840
editor i use and wait for calculations

697
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
then

698
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,159
i had to walk home and come back

699
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,799
and drink a cough some coffee and do my

700
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,120
real daytime job make some money

701
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,639
then go home come back and after about

702
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,639
three days everything was joined

703
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:22,399
and now we could see for the island of

704
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,519
of enhold we could see

705
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:29,279
how much is covered by

706
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,720
by an absolute wet dream of 30 meters

707
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,919
actually this is a little joke because i

708
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,720
i put a map on twitter saying

709
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
because people were wondering how far is

710
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,840
this how many it's

711
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,279
easy to say so how much is actually

712
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,158
going to be covered and i put a map of

713
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,760
denmark that was

714
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,000
all yellow like in all yellow

715
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,600
the three parts that wasn't covered was

716
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,440
the island of enhand

717
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,600
where i come from in in vincesel where

718
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,080
nobody lives

719
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,080
and some

720
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,960
natura 2000 area into

721
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,640
where only cows walk around

722
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,839
but the rest of denmark was basically

723
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,560
covered in the first version of the map

724
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,560
and then um

725
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:20,560
of course i did some different types of

726
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,239
visualizations as as

727
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,480
nick started correcting himself with

728
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,839
with distances

729
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,119
and we'll go back to this later because

730
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,719
we'll see in in a minute because

731
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,320
let's take all the the talk and then

732
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,239
we'll see the solution uh

733
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,599
in the end by popular demand this turned

734
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,918
into a

735
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,599
website because every time someone said

736
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,078
couldn't you just visualize this also

737
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,040
how about

738
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,320
my area i want to zoom in then i had to

739
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,279
wait

740
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,320
around three hours for for my stupid

741
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,599
one-time solution

742
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,720
rendering another zoom level so i

743
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,680
took what what we do at our place i took

744
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,200
map server

745
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,799
and uh i put in a docker container just

746
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,640
eating up chunks of data from the

747
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,599
database and made a slow version of

748
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,240
camera techniques

749
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,240
test system medical and then

750
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,320
i was pumped some more so i

751
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,560
tried to make it a bit faster by

752
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,160
pre-generating all the data

753
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,078
that make it did actually make it a bit

754
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,560
faster but when you wanted to see the

755
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,240
middle of copenhagen and

756
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,960
i had more than two visitors at the same

757
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,200
time then everything broke

758
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,880
so i split it again and that's a little

759
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,040
trick in geography

760
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,320
uh actually i think i've used most of

761
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,279
the tricks in the book here i split it

762
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,599
into smaller areas and tiled those

763
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,640
and then it's actually quick enough at

764
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,079
least

765
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,799
to show so what is the actually

766
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,160
what i what i made let's uh let's have a

767
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,640
look and uh

768
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,920
i'll just talk you over what we can see

769
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,920
because it's nothing special

770
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:04,480
it's

771
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,480
it's my eyes shook my mouse disappeared

772
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,480
i have two mice now one on each screen

773
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,839
so can i say that

774
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,520
that's it okay so let's see

775
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,520
this is

776
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,240
i can't even read my own words

777
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,839
i'll just have a look

778
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,839
from here

779
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,560
just a sec

780
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,839
as we just talked about you need to be

781
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,839
yeah something

782
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,839
needs to go wrong it's not the version

783
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,839
of the slides i uploaded to our server

784
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,599
this morning so

785
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:19,200
i had that last two you have to

786
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:23,680
bear with me keep changes

787
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:27,919
so now we see the same

788
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:31,040
nice so basically before

789
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:35,359
actually you had the right to film

790
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:39,680
15 minute meters from from a facade

791
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:43,359
and this is all the buildings in the

792
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,240
in denmark loaded and then 15 meters

793
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,240
from the facades

794
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,879
are drawn with the yellow and if you

795
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:54,319
zoom out you can see

796
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:54,320
this is today not much

797
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,000
we can zoom down to funen

798
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,040
so actually today with 15 meters and

799
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,560
then

800
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,880
this is these are the areas that are

801
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,880
covered

802
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,520
and then we can switch to which areas

803
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,400
are now

804
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,400
covered by the new law

805
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,560
and then hopefully it will

806
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,920
update

807
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,839
so if we zoom in

808
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,320
you will funnily enough see two types of

809
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,440
shades

810
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,720
new areas and all

811
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,119
areas so we can try to remove before

812
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,359
and this this these on pure new rides

813
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,359
now

814
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,079
scattered all over a small provincial

815
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:58,240
town in denmark

816
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,839
sorry to anyone from no we know where

817
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,839
this is

818
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,320
these are new areas so

819
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,599
these are only areas that are extended

820
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,040
but who has got

821
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,520
new rights so any anyone who had

822
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,160
were allowed to film 15 minutes meters

823
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,640
before but

824
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:21,118
are now allowed to peak just a bit more

825
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,920
in your private life

826
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:25,200
how much is that and that is of course

827
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,200
more

828
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,598
than the new areas but new areas were

829
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,480
not cctv before

830
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,800
so now this is someone private getting

831
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,960
access to

832
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:43,359
film view so these are the 15 meters

833
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:47,200
subtracted plus 15 minutes meters

834
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,520
so this guy down here is now allowed

835
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,839
just this part more into the into the

836
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,839
street

837
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,119
and if i turn to to the technical map

838
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,040
then you can see that i actually took

839
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,200
the buildings you can see the form

840
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,880
of the area uh covered by by

841
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,319
surveillance you can see that it forms

842
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,520
like the building because this is only

843
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:15,279
from the facade

844
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,560
i took the buildings on each parcel

845
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,480
or actually on each real property

846
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,400
and extended those with 30 meters

847
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,839
and then subtracted the 15 meters that

848
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,599
they were supposedly already

849
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,720
allowed to film and then uh

850
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,680
these are the extra areas and

851
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,839
and uh i had a talk with with uh

852
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,839
anascaros about this and he said

853
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,880
where should i go if i don't want to be

854
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,879
filmed and then i

855
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,640
finally said well go somewhere in the

856
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,480
park

857
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,480
and then i caught myself thinking oh no

858
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,119
but the municipality is actually allowed

859
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,000
to film

860
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,720
if it owns the park so please go to a

861
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,359
park where

862
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,078
someone private owns it and you're

863
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,040
allowed

864
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,280
well wait a minute so there there aren't

865
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,920
many places in denmark that's that's my

866
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,520
my point about this there aren't many

867
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,640
places in denmark where you are not near

868
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,480
the shop

869
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:18,078
you are always near some kind of shop

870
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,480
and it's uh you need we need guys like

871
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,359
you

872
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,359
trying to to

873
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,640
when people say this well it's only 30

874
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,920
meters when we need someone saying well

875
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,920
how much is it in total

876
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,598
because it always ends up in examples

877
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,520
and saying

878
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:37,520
30 meters from a facade isn't that much

879
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,799
and if you live where i live where where

880
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,280
every fourth or fifth house

881
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,500
has a liberal company private company

882
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,520
then receiving and delivering

883
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,160
[Music]

884
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,839
parcels would make them able to to film

885
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,240
their own property plus

886
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:00,720
a good part of the the public area

887
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,720
around it

888
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,960
so it's not only in straw in copenhagen

889
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,400
that you're filmed

890
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,400
it is it's basically

891
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,279
where people live

892
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,240
and i need to add all of these so you

893
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,800
can see this is the total

894
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,759
now situation with the new so where

895
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,040
people live you are

896
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,920
able to to be filmed some of you might

897
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,839
have seen

898
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,680
the first version of my map the one

899
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:30,720
where denmark was all yellow

900
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,399
but that was because someone maybe a

901
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,799
minister of law

902
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,200
accidentally said he thought maybe a

903
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,720
couple of hundred meters would be

904
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,000
appropriate and at least that didn't go

905
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,959
into into the final text because then we

906
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,520
would have been

907
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,640
i'll just find it here then we would

908
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,680
have been

909
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,160
a completely other place we would have

910
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,160
been here

911
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,839
with uh

912
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,680
with this image

913
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,119
so

914
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,040
this was the first it would make sense

915
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:16,160
about 200 meters

916
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,759
illustration that's a bit to think about

917
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,920
because i i totally agree

918
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,920
stuff you don't uh you can't uh

919
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,000
visualize yourself then then it seems

920
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,359
reasonable 200 beats that that's not far

921
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,599
but in total it seems

922
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:32,880
like quite a lot if you if you ask me

923
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,880
let's uh jump to

924
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,040
somewhere else uh

925
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,960
like this

926
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,880
most of the danes know this image it's

927
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,520
the king he's been shot in the eye so in

928
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,720
conclusion

929
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,759
the the sometimes you need to help when

930
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,919
he's blinded to help him see

931
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,800
but it's not over yet and probably

932
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,280
should

933
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:04,079
carry on and i think that was

934
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,079
all for me today oh and we're hiring

935
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,839
thank you

936
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,839
30 meters from buildings

937
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,240
but the field is a private property yeah

938
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,440
so it's 30 meters from buildings

939
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,720
onto public property a maximum of 30

940
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,440
meters a private property is your

941
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,439
private property

942
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,560
no but you can fill me a private

943
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:51,119
property as far as i'm

944
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:53,119
aware basically everything owned by

945
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,800
either a municipality

946
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,280
a private person or the government is

947
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,280
all yellow

948
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,079
that's a philosophical question yeah

949
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,078
embassies no yeah well

950
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,440
they're owned by someone too who maybe

951
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,000
don't care about the rules but yeah

952
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,319
basically that's that's the point

953
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,319
so it's how far uh you're allowed to

954
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,400
film on someone else's

955
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,920
territory you're never allowed to film

956
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,280
into private property for instance

957
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,800
you're not allowed to film people that

958
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,760
are naked in their

959
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,760
garden and so forth

960
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,800
but the first uh all yellow map is

961
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,920
basically if you count out

962
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,040
anything municipality municipal anything

963
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,760
private anything uh

964
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,720
yeah governmental then you don't have

965
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,480
much of denmark

966
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:44,480
actually i don't know of places in

967
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,920
denmark that

968
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,400
that aren't owned by those three

969
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,319
entities i think it's quite a base

970
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,480
in law that anything newly discovered is

971
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:54,079
owned by the king so

972
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,359
if you find some new spot then it would

973
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,640
probably be the government's

974
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:01,839
responsibility to film you there

975
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,839
when needed

976
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,520
i'm sure that anas told me i have to

977
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,799
register my cameras because i have

978
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,759
cameras myself

979
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,280
so i think the list is is held privately

980
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,680
by the police

981
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,319
but you can make your own donation by

982
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,919
telling

983
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,520
isn't that true you can go register

984
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,560
yourself if you're a business

985
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,599
yeah donate your fine

986
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:34,560
cameras to the police by

987
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,760
volunteering on the list or actually i

988
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,759
think you're supposed to do it now

989
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:45,040
but i don't i i wouldn't

990
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,160
deem it plausible that you would

991
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,160
be able to get the list

992
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,000
they liked the list

993
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
yes

994
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,839
yes

995
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,839
yeah yeah we do actually the the

996
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,359
metrological institute of denmark only

997
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,119
recently opened that data and it's

998
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:34,319
in small steps uh because

999
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:35,040
the fear is that the public api will

1000
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:39,119
break down

1001
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,880
and critical infrastructure will be

1002
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:44,319
harmed if if we don't know so uh

1003
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,400
so if anything breaks down so they're

1004
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,240
building a free free version of it now

1005
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,240
and apparently lightnings are now free

1006
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,640
so if it was lightnings you were looking

1007
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,720
for

1008
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:55,759
they should have been publicized or

1009
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,759
published last week

1010
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,160
yeah it's it's they're opening small

1011
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:03,280
parts it's it's really you have to

1012
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,598
also some sometimes uh really really

1013
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,720

1014
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,240

the public admin guys i work with are

1016
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,720
very interested in people using the data

1017
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,119

1018
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,160
trying with baby steps and seeing

1019
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,359
learning

1020
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:21,440
when things break and when they don't

1021
