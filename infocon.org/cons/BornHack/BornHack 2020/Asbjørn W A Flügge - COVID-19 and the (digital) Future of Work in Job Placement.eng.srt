1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,039
yeah thank you

2
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,198
my name is ashby and i'm a phd student

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,439
at the university of copenhagen

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,400
and today i'm going to talk about kovite

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,439
19 and

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,278
the possible digital future of work

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:35,440
more concretely in job placements

8
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,960
just to give you a brief agenda um

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,199
we kind of had this idea that

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,120
covet 19 could perhaps provide us with a

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,640
glimpse into the future i don't know if

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,320
any of you had had this discussion with

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,559
your friends or your colleagues like

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
what can we learn from kovit 19 what are

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,399
the the changes we're going to see

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,160
now how are they going to affect our

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,399
future and that was kind of the

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,879
motivation for the talk i'm giving today

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,600
um i'm going to give a short

20
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,839
introduction

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,159
to a study i've conducted together with

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,000
my supervisor niah holdenville

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,040
in danish job centers and i'm going to

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,159
give you a short experience following a

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,200
peter uh effective job consultant

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
working in

27
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,280
in a danish municipality and then i'm

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,280
gonna come into the discussion of some

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,640
challenges for the digital future of

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,159
work yes but we kind of had this

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
assumption that we were perhaps looking

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,920
into a covet 19 crystal ball

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,240
and we saw three tendencies someone

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,280
started before kobe 19 and some have

35
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,158
started

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,079
recently due to kobe 19 and first of all

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,720
is rising unemployment we see

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,399
unemployment unemployment numbers

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,399
skyrocketing all over the world that

40
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,640
includes denmark

41
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,920
we because of these huge numbers of

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,920
unemployed citizens

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,159
we also see an increased call for

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,840
efficiency within job placement

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,600
job centers needs to be more effective

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,719
getting jobs for people

47
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,439
and following a longer trend we see

48
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,119
accelerating digitization working

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,679
digital and remotely

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,560
became the new normal during covet 19

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,040
and

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,959
is following a 20-year long trend of

53
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,079
digitization especially in public

54
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,000
administration

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
and we presume that this trend is has

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,560
only been strengthened due to kobit 19.

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,760
so what we were looking at is how does

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,319
the future of

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,359
job centers or work in job centers and

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,640
job placement

61
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,319
look like and that was what we

62
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,599
investigated and this is the story i'm

63
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,040
going to talk with you about

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,238
today a very brief uh

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,560
bio before going into academia i used to

66
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,840
work at the local government denmark

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,920
kl where i worked with digitization i

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,720
have also been working at monday morning

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,200
mandamon a danish think tank and i'm

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,680
also

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,679
a former mp candidate for the party

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,239
alternative in denmark

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,920
and today i'm a phd fellow at the

74
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,640
department of computer science

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,640
at ku

76
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,760
and investigating

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,599
job centers or job placements and how

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,518
they use

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,200
to how the digital job center looks like

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,440
was kind of interesting because

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,640
what my phd is actually about is how the

82
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,519
public administration

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,399
implement algorithms and ai for decision

84
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,760
support

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,319
and what i'm going to talk with you

86
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,640
about today is not how new technologies

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,238
emerge in this digital job center but

88
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,359
probably how

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,799
older more known technologies actually

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,959
played a crucial role

91
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,959
in work in the digital job center

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,640
just briefly about method and data

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,720
collection

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,119
um i conducted weekly interviews with

95
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,040
three

96
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,799
job consultants from three danish

97
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,720
municipalities

98
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,920
in total i conducted more than 60

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,120
interviews and

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,319
the study was from the 20th of april on

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,640
to the 26th of

102
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,839
june and this is the study i will talk

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
with you about today

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,519
the study continues and i'm starting the

105
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,439
interviews with the job

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,560
same job consultants again after the the

107
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,120
summer vacation

108
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,959
to experience how is it going back from

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,320
having working remotely to again

110
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
in working physically so just to say

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,199
that we have like

112
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:23,440
a pretty dense and heavy

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,520
data positive data collection from how

114
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,320
it is for job consultants or employment

115
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
consultants

116
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,680
to work in job centers or working from

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,000
home

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,280
due to doing a the corona lockdown

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,400
and then i all wanted to meet peter

120
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,119
peter is a effective person

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,479
he is a job consultant working in a

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
danish

123
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,280
job center and i'm gonna tell you his

124
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,359
story today

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,039
peter is of course not real he is a

126
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,720
mixture of the six job consultants i

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,520
followed for 10 weeks

128
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
and the quotes and different points i'm

129
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,039
going to bring forward today

130
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,080
are from these different job consultants

131
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,400
all presented by

132
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,400
peter

133
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,400
usually peer works in a

134
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,880
physical job center and that means that

135
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,080
yes as you can see in the picture he

136
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,800
will meet his

137
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,840
citizens physically face to face being

138
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,120
co-located

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,198
his main tasks are to categorize

140
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,520
citizens are they

141
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,639
are they going to receive cash benefits

142
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
contented

143
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,759
or are they receiving some other public

144
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,240
support for example

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,280
dao peng or are they entitled to maybe

146
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,880
other

147
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,280
public services than that and

148
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,320
usually he is physically located at the

149
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,000
job center and

150
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,759
when he have has a complex case he will

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,960
discuss the case with the cult with

152
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,039
with his colleagues and he will use

153
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
those official documentation for example

154
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
a medical documentation

155
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,199
to assess the case of a citizen and you

156
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,199
also use

157
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
the human experience of meeting

158
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,560
face-to-face with another person in

159
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,280
assessing the case of a citizen

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
but peter also told me that well

161
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,280
something happens when the citizen

162
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,440
steps through the door of the job center

163
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,080
which doesn't happen over the phone

164
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,360
and when you step through the doors of

165
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,919
the job center it became

166
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,919
very clearly that you are an unemployed

167
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:27,599
and perhaps vulnerable individual

168
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,960
facing the public authority which have

169
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,759
power over you to decide your case and

170
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,400
perhaps some

171
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,680
pretty significant parts of your life

172
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,719
and this is what he says

173
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,520
well this doesn't happen over the phone

174
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
but this is peter working physically

175
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,280
placed

176
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,560
at the job center as you all know

177
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,559
we were denmark was closed down due to

178
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,199
corona and

179
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,400
many of us working with the knowledge

180
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,120
worker that includes

181
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,080
job consultants are working from home

182
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,759
and

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,280
when peter was working from home and the

184
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
other job consulted working from home

185
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,440
we saw this as the emerging of the

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,799
digital job center whether you're

187
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,319
all working from home you're working

188
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,280
through your computer and technologies

189
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,639
well that

190
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,880
creates a digital job center and

191
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,319
simultaneously the legislation on the

192
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,039
area called

193
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,759
active disciplines insights meaning that

194
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,840
unemployed individuals need to

195
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,800
send out two upperclass applications

196
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,758
each week for example or they need to

197
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,120
be at specific points in time at the job

198
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
center or else they will be

199
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,080
cut in public benefits was suspended

200
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,319
and this created a significant change

201
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,318
for peter because he says

202
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,319
he still needed to call a lot of newly

203
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,400
unemployed individuals to see

204
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,160
what public benefits are they entitled

205
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
to but

206
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
calling them doing corona he said well

207
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,080
the job seekers are happy that we call

208
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,599
them

209
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,440
it's different than before when they had

210
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,960
to come at the job center they're happy

211
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,319
that they're not forgotten

212
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,080
that someone cares about them

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
a week later he said well we actually

214
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,840
call it care interviews

215
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,759
or service interviews because the job

216
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,719
center job seekers

217
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,000
can just say no to talking with us it's

218
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,599
completely voluntarily

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,360
but of course they don't do that the

220
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,360
difference between the interviews is

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,479
that at a regular under normal

222
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
circumstances

223
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,000
we would have to activate and offer for

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,479
example an internship

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
that is obligations and rights called in

226
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,520
danish

227
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,840
data these things were suspended

228
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,359
so before working at the physical job

229
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,838
center peter had

230
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,599
three up to three months to categorize

231
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,399
uh unemployed individuals for example

232
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,039
are you

233
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,839
ready to take a job or are you not ready

234
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,838
to take a job

235
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,480
during corona he only instead of three

236
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,480
months he was making this categorization

237
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,000
in one phone call but what became more

238
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
important for peter was

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,440
that they made this categorization in

240
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
one phone call because they had a lot of

241
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
newly unemployed people

242
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,399
coming in when they needed to call and

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
also

244
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,000
he felt the need to ensure that people

245
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,120
got what they were eligible of so

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,080
instead of

247
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,720
prolonging the process to say okay we

248
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,320
need

249
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,480
all this type of documentation to say

250
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
that you're actually eligible for that

251
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,800
type of public benefit and of this type

252
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,320
he made the categorization a decision in

253
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
one phone call saying well people need

254
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,360
to get

255
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,160
what they're entitled and then we will

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,640
afterwards

257
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,439
reassure or see if this was the right

258
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
decision

259
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,480
do you have a question just a quick

260
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,480
question yeah so

261
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
uh

262
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,000
in denmark yesterday the unemployment

263
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,440
also rose

264
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,360
not as drastically as in the u.s

265
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,720
from the three different municipalities

266
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,680
i looked at

267
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,600
the unemployment rose between 30 and 200

268
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,599
percent

269
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
but there are huge local differences in

270
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
the municipalities

271
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,240
the municipality would have the highest

272
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,200
increase

273
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,640
was a municipality who relied a lot on

274
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
tourism for example

275
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,959
so even in a small country as denmark

276
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,719
corona affected

277
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,640
the different municipalities differently

278
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,160
i talked with another municipality who

279
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,640
are about the same size

280
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,079
and they were haven't had the the same

281
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,079
increase of unemployment numbers

282
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,600
yes the the absolute employment is still

283
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,719
low but it was still rising drastically

284
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,720
but compared to countries like the u.s

285
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,720
we are we're doing very good i would say

286
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
yes

287
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,640
uh yeah the question was if the the job

288
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,560
centers

289
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,480
experienced increase in number of job

290
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,439
seekers and if that stressed the the job

291
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,720
consultants

292
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,640
and a beginning in the beginning it did

293
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,160
because they had a lot of

294
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,920
a lot of phone calls they need to make

295
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,160
we need to get in contact with

296
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,599
all these new unemployed individuals

297
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,519
and the unemployed individuals not

298
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,399
necessarily registered unemployed

299
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,640
correctly

300
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
for example if you are receiving cash

301
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
benefits

302
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,680
contented well then it's not enough just

303
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,239
to say that you are unemployed on job

304
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,239
net

305
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,279
but if you are receiving doubting that

306
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,760
will be sufficient

307
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,720
so people kind of registered wrong and

308
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,880
to ensure that you are receiving the

309
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,800
cash benefits you are entitled to the

310
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,640
job consultants needed to get in contact

311
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,160
you to say okay well you have

312
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,480
you're not ready to take a job right now

313
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,079
okay well then your public benefit will

314
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,440
be higher than if you're ready to take a

315
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,920
job now

316
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,120
so the job peter or the other job

317
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,319
consultant i talked with

318
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,000
had for example list of 175 names who

319
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,600
they just needed to call

320
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,760
and figure out you're newly unemployed

321
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,079
why are you unemployed what are the

322
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,959
reasons do you have other obstacles than

323
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,719
just being fired from corona what cash

324
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,160
benefits can you receive so

325
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,760
they had a huge task um and i will i'll

326
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,279
get back to that also but about an

327
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,480
another question

328
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,240
um but to put it um

329
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,560
to put it quite bluntly

330
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,279
they were not caring more for citizens

331
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,279
now when the

332
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,560
legislation was suspended and they were

333
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,279
working from home but

334
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,800
care caring for the citizens just took

335
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,600
up more of their time when they talked

336
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,680
to the citizens

337
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,200
for example they were not they don't

338
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,040
have they didn't have to talk about

339
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,800
rights and obligations they were more

340
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
interested in for example

341
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,120
identifying unemployed individuals who

342
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,360
might have the risk of becoming

343
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,399
lonely or suffer from depression due to

344
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,839
probate 19.

345
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,519
so there were other measures that the

346
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,120
job consultants focused on

347
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:59,920
now than usually

348
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,639
and quite interesting working digitally

349
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,519
often meant

350
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,519
by telephone

351
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,160
the calling the main contact between the

352
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,319
job center and the

353
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,160
job consoles and the citizens was by

354
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,399
telephone so

355
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,600
we were at least discussing me and my

356
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,279
supervisor that

357
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
perhaps the digital job center is not

358
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,120
that digital maybe the digital job

359
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,079
center is

360
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,360
is just using old technologies as a

361
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,199
telephone which is

362
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,959
quite paradoxically for us because i am

363
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,920
investigating the use

364
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,800
of intelligent technologies as ai and

365
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,360
algorithms

366
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,120
in job placement but when you see during

367
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
a crisis well then it's the old

368
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,480
technologies that will

369
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,638
survive and make everything come

370
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,000
together and not these new technologies

371
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,440
which was quite interesting for us

372
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,360
but yeah this this more or increased

373
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,000
focus on care

374
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,480
change due to during this period because

375
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,959
when we're in june

376
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,320
the legislation is is back again so

377
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,719
people need to have

378
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,560
the active employment effort are back so

379
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
people need to be available for the job

380
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,920
center

381
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,440
and peter said well now it's about

382
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,599
rights and obligations

383
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,639
rather clicked when it's about these

384
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,560
things it's a

385
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,079
it's about going through the rights and

386
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,239
obligation both to ensure

387
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,079
their legal rights and also making it

388
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,720
possible for us to sanction them

389
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,599
is our only line of action so yes the

390
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,519
interviews have changed

391
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,639
and this happened when the old

392
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,560
legislation

393
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,440
came forward but the the job consultants

394
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,279
were still

395
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,480
working from home so now they face the

396
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,720
challenge of

397
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,480
saying some very sensitive things for

398
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,160
example saying well you cannot receive

399
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,399
your public benefits because you missed

400
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,000
this and this and this meeting by saying

401
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,680
it over the phone

402
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
perhaps actually saying well because you

403
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,638
didn't pick up your phone

404
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,480
on our scheduled meeting we're going to

405
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,680
cut your benefits

406
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,680
that was how it was supposed to be like

407
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,439
following the law in our experience the

408
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,519
job consultants

409
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,880
were quite flexible about that because

410
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,399
disabled is a very very special

411
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,279
situation so we're not gonna sanction

412
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,199
people for just

413
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,320
for not picking up the phone as if they

414
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,639
have had missed

415
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:16,560
uh the same the same meeting physically

416
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,000
um and during the corona the rules of

417
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,279
unemployment change quite

418
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:24,320
drastically um in march

419
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,639
unemployment was the this employment

420
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,560
effort was suspended and then

421
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,560
in may 15 during the myth of our study

422
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,959
the employment was reactivated so in

423
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,758
this period people

424
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,880
the it was the period of care meetings

425
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,519
with the citizens

426
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,480
and in the other period was when they

427
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,440
were

428
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,440
have to tell unemployed individuals

429
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,120
about their rights and obligations

430
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,480
which was a challenge for the

431
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
unemployment consultant

432
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,839
and which i think will continue to be a

433
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,199
challenge when you're dealing with

434
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,360
sensitive

435
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,199
topics as sanctioning people for doing

436
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,120
it over the phone

437
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,040
and from june 15th the first job

438
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,560
consultant started to get

439
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,759
back into the office and

440
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,439
my study continues and right now all the

441
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,639
job consultants are working

442
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,399
back at their offices full time and

443
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,639
how that is going i will get back to

444
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,639
that

445
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,040
peter is of course not alone when he

446
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,040
meets the the citizens he

447
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,120
has colleagues and in the beginning

448
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,719
under the the lockdown he said well it's

449
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,680
first of all it's difficult to separate

450
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
work time

451
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,040
work time from lay time i came to think

452
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
about how much

453
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,560
i usually work around and go around and

454
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,199
get things done

455
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,199
over the table you know chit chatting

456
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
over the coffee machine or oh i have a

457
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,959
complex case with this

458
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,120
type of legislation i'm just gonna walk

459
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,040
down to the expert sitting

460
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
at the other office to to get help on my

461
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,959
case

462
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,920
this was very difficult for them working

463
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,920
at home working remotely

464
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,839
in may a month later he says well i

465
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,279
don't receive as many phone calls as i

466
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,600
did in march or april

467
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,319
my time on the phone has decreased

468
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,520
people use

469
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,438
email instead or don't we're more sure

470
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,879
on what to do and one trust with the job

471
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,880
you're carrying out

472
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,280
meaning you don't need to ping-pong that

473
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,559
much so what they emphasized

474
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,760
in the beginning in april was i really

475
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,520
miss my colleagues

476
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,919
and they were trying all these new ways

477
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,039
to experiment keeping

478
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,440
online coffee meetings or online

479
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,879
walk and talk to to keep in social

480
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,679
contact with each other and they really

481
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,360
missed this

482
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,440
collegial contact but in may

483
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,559
it kind of found another level and they

484
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
didn't

485
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,639
emphasize the need to talk that much to

486
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,000
their colleagues as they did in april

487
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,000
and when we're going to june

488
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,960
there they said well i don't have that

489
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,799
that much contact to my colleagues now

490
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,400
maybe we call each other a little more

491
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,799
but the need for talking with them

492
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,640
has decreased it's actually going just

493
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,480
fine without all that contact

494
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,400
it's actually thought-provoking that you

495
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,000
don't miss your colleagues that much

496
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,320
people are better off with the situation

497
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,600
now and everybody is actually okay

498
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,039
working from home

499
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,280
maybe we're good at good at adapting

500
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,080
and this was quite striking for me

501
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,678
because i have

502
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,600
these weekly interviews with the job

503
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,760
consultants and in june

504
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,520
it occurred to me that they entirely

505
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,520
stopped talking about their colleagues

506
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,039
and they just said like what's going on

507
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,639
how is the your contact with your

508
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,440
colleagues and then they said that

509
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,280
said this we don't actually need each

510
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,679
other that much anymore we kind of have

511
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,160
found

512
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,039
a new way to work probably also because

513
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,400
they have

514
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,559
had more experience to work from home

515
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,320
and they have experienced the benefits

516
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,600
of working from home

517
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,799
for example the ability to decide when

518
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,000
they will

519
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,400
call citizens or the silence

520
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,520
working in your own house and not in an

521
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
open office as

522
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,240
many of them do

523
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
and then there's the the paradox of the

524
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,840
digital meeting and i think that this

525
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,160
point is especially important not only

526
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,120
for

527
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,919
job placement but from for the entire

528
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,678
field of

529
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,000
public services where you have public

530
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,880
officials meeting with

531
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,760
citizens so not only job placement but

532
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,960
it can also be

533
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,039
social services for example and

534
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,000
the paradox is that the digital job

535
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,039
center

536
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,640
is at the same time more intrusive

537
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,280
and less intrusive for both parts

538
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,480
let's start with the less interesting

539
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,559
when you

540
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
as i said in the beginning peter said

541
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,440
well when you walk through the door as

542
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,879
an unemployed individual it's pretty

543
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,039
clear that you're facing

544
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,039
an authority this doesn't happen over

545
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,840
the phone you are more on

546
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,559
an equal level also because you're

547
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,039
probably both

548
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,918
calling from home you're in safe

549
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,559
surroundings

550
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
it's comfortable and as i said in the

551
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,918
beginning

552
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,360
when a job consultant assesses the case

553
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,880
of the citizen trying to figure out

554
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,158
what's the best way for them

555
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,000
he not only uses the all the documents

556
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,159
he can assess but also the

557
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,760
feeling the the contact the emotional

558
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,400
contact you get from the other person

559
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,919
and this is decrease over the telephone

560
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
so it is

561
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,120
but this is the decrease but kind of

562
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,559
increases

563
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,559
the autonomy of the citizen it is easier

564
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,399
as a citizen when you only talk with the

565
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,200
job consultant over the phone

566
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,120
to disguise if you for example have been

567
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,520
drinking a lot of alcohol or haven't

568
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,158
gotten a lot of sleep

569
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,600
so in this way the digital meeting is

570
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,039
less intrusive it is more

571
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,559
private for the citizens you're meeting

572
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,000
the job center online you don't have to

573
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,760
walk through the doors

574
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,520
but when the job center can call you

575
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,960
they can reach you anywhere they can

576
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,559
reach you in the supermarket

577
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
they can reach you when you're picking

578
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,240
up your kids they can even reach you at

579
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,120
home

580
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,480
so you don't even you can't even limit

581
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,879
the meeting with the job center to

582
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
actually

583
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,320
going to not neutral ground but the

584
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,520
ground of the jobs and now the job

585
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,439
center can

586
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,960
put his hand into your home and reach

587
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,440
you there

588
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,120
and the same goes for the job consultant

589
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
i talked with a job consultant about

590
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,959
this

591
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,799
yesterday and told her this

592
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,320
this paradox and he said well yes it

593
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,000
goes the other way around because

594
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,678
it's not all you want to show the living

595
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,280
room for example to

596
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,919
as an individual as an unemployed

597
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,520
individual to a job consultant

598
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,960
and it's not all job consultants who

599
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,360
want to show the living room to an

600
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,760
unemployed individual there's this

601
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,799
mixture of private private and

602
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,039
professional space

603
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:42,879
that is kind of getting mixed up in this

604
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,400
so my point is that the digital job

605
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,120
center

606
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,320
is more and less intrusive at the same

607
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,399
time

608
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,480
and another challenge for this is which

609
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,559
is also a surprise for me

610
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,919
but not for the job consultants was that

611
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,320
there are still persons

612
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,200
unemployed people with who don't have a

613
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,559
phone

614
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,559
or who don't have a computer or who

615
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,000
believe that if they open up a computer

616
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,080
with a webcam on that well then

617
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,520
everybody can spy on them

618
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,158
and these are legit concerns and legit

619
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,240
and real

620
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,240
challenges that we need to take into

621
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,000
consideration when we discuss

622
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,480
how are we gonna uh how is the future

623
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,360
for

624
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,039
digital or work placement how is it

625
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,840
gonna look like how will we continue to

626
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,840
meet our citizens

627
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,679
and that brings me to to to the next

628
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,760
slide some important

629
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,280
challenges and decisions for the future

630
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,799
of work

631
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,360
and as a doc consultant said in in june

632
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,520
well

633
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,760
there are a lot of meetings right now

634
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,799
and both numbers and contents needs to

635
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
be the same

636
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,120
that is the the legal content rights and

637
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,600
applications

638
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,520
but we but we have to do it on the phone

639
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,959
and in the beginning we try to allocate

640
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,720
20 minutes per meeting

641
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,600
but after one day we need to change it

642
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,840
back we change it back to 30 minutes

643
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,280
so right now or at least before the song

644
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,439
vacation

645
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,200
job consultant faced a huge challenge of

646
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,520
talking with

647
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,559
all the unemployed individuals and

648
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,559
having the meetings

649
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,480
as if it was a physical meeting with

650
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,000
rights obligations saying if you don't

651
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,480
meet up you will be sanctioned

652
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
this is your right to complain all that

653
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,200
stuff but now they just have to do it

654
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,240
over the phone

655
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,880
and as the job consultant stressed to me

656
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,440
it is and you probably also know it if

657
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,360
you have

658
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,799
discussed a delicate matter with one of

659
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,439
your friends or colleagues

660
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,559
it can be nice to sit in front of one

661
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,080
and one another

662
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,559
when you're talking about sensitive

663
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,360
topics and that is a challenge for job

664
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,120
consultants

665
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,479
talking about sensitive topic as

666
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,879
sanctioning a citizen

667
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,080
but on but not able to see the person

668
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,799
you're actually talking with

669
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:54,240
but only over the phone um

670
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,520
another concern and that is especially

671
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,000
challenging from a policy perspective is

672
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,918
as peter said well i'm primarily working

673
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,480
with people on unemployment benefits

674
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,360
that means doubting or people receiving

675
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,159
cash assistance

676
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,879
contented from above one would say that

677
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,200
everybody

678
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,320
needs to be digital but when you look

679
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,279
closely there will be

680
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,559
nuances some groups of people receiving

681
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,159
unemployment benefits

682
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,240
will be challenged and some groups

683
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,039
receiving cash benefits will be able to

684
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,880
do it

685
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,879
so it's quite my point to say that it's

686
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,960
quite easy to say well okay people on

687
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
down payment they are probably more

688
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,320
digital ready than people on

689
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,000
contentive let's make the people on

690
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,439
daoping have different meetings and the

691
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
people uncontentive have

692
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,320
physical meetings but the point from

693
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,960
from peter and the job consultants is

694
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,840
well there are differences and nuances

695
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,559
across

696
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,879
these groups you can be uncontented but

697
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,520
be

698
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,640
right over high school and be quite

699
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,000
digital and you have

700
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,720
could have been doubting it and be 65

701
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,360
and not be

702
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,400
that digital to put it very

703
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,000
stereotypically

704
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:02,480
but these are some of the the nuances

705
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
that the job consultant fear would will

706
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,400
not be taken into consideration

707
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,279
when the future is laid down by policy

708
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
and before this talk i kind of googled

709
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,000
the

710
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,279
google the future of work and when you

711
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,799
look at the future of work

712
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,960
it seems rather rather digital it seems

713
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,080
it's a digital it's automation it's

714
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,320
artificial intelligence

715
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,158
and this is quite interesting as i said

716
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,360
well the main digital technology the job

717
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,720
consultants used was

718
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,000
of course email but it was their phone

719
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,480
and it's especially interesting when

720
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,600
we need to discuss what is being lost in

721
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,600
the digital

722
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,360
meeting which you can have in the

723
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,439
physical meeting for example

724
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,199
sensing the person right in front of you

725
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,520
what is actually going on with them

726
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,320
which is much at least the consultants

727
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,039
tell me

728
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,279
is much harder doing over the phone or

729
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,840
via skype or whatever

730
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,840
so

731
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,760
we kind of discussed well is the future

732
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,799
of job placement digital

733
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,879
and from what i can see from

734
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,000
central organizations public

735
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,120
organization

736
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,559
is that as i said in the beginning

737
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:20,000
because of corona there is a push for

738
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,559
more dignitization for example i figured

739
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,159
out that

740
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,000
i'm working as a researcher at ku and i

741
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,440
can do a lot of my science a lot of my

742
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
work i can do it from home

743
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,600
reading writing articles i can talk on

744
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,440
the phone with my supervisor

745
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,559
it works fine but i'm not having in the

746
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,279
same way to deal

747
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,918
with serving people as for example

748
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,279
people

749
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,960
in school teachers or people in

750
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,679
job placement who needs to be in

751
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,880
physical contact with with citizens

752
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,640
so i think that a challenge for the

753
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,960
future of job placement will be

754
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,760
how do we decide whom will we meet

755
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,320
physically

756
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,679
and whom will we meet digitally and what

757
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,360
will the consequences of these two

758
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,919
meetings will be and about what topics

759
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,120
can we meet

760
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,039
with people and this kind of leads me to

761
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,000
my last question to you and then i'll be

762
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:15,520
done is is the future of welfare digital

763
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,400
because i don't know about you but i see

764
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,399
that

765
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,159
digitization is a mega trend and it will

766
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,199
continue and it

767
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,520
in many areas will also affect

768
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,360
welfare we will have online meetings

769
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,240
with our doctor and that could be fine

770
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,039
we can

771
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,200
uh 3d print stuff we can do a lot of

772
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,559
online tests and a lot of online service

773
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,320
instead of meeting people

774
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,760
physically but how the future of digital

775
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,360
welfare is going to look like is going

776
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,799
to be a huge

777
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,520
topic in the future and i think it's

778
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,000
going to be very important that we

779
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
as the the job consultant says don't

780
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,799
just say

781
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,880
think that we can categorize people from

782
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,559
our useful categories of people on

783
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,000
doubting they can be digital and people

784
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,918
are content with content

785
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,440
they can't be digital or will not

786
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,520
benefit from digital meetings

787
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,919
and will make mistakes and miss all the

788
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:07,520
different nuances within this

789
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,520
gray complex area

790
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,039
if you have any questions now or

791
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,960
afterwards

792
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,440
you can reach out to me at my email

793

at the ku at the confronting data co-lab

796
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,159
where we investigate complex

797
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,720
topics as ai in public administration

798
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,120
tech in society or the future of work

799
