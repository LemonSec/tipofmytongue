1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,719
yes

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,080
hello uh this talk i would like to

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,199
talk about of this thing called pkf

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,680
files and

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
for most people it doesn't give sense

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,198
and if you google this kind of

7
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,840
files it will actually match with some

8
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:45,840
adobe files which is not the case

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:45,840
but this is like a

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
so so this is just a hobby project that

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
i did

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,839
in order to make a tribute to michael

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,920
robinson who was a

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960
tv personality from spain and also like

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,119
the pc

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,600
football community which he he helped

17
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,600
build up

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,360
so he recently died for cancer

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,479
and this is like i say this is the

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:20,080
reason i made this project

21
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,679
so about what i'm going to show

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,360
in the next minutes i will talk a little

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,600
bit about myself

24
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,240
i would give a bit more detail than just

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,079
being distributed to michael robinson

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
i will talk about the the tooling that i

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,798
actually created

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,720
pcx utils and i will talk a bit bob

29
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,000
before and after what happened when i

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,720
went public with the code

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,720
and i will then show a short demo

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,079
so i'm a mixture of danish and a

33
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,000
spanish merits so this is why i have

34
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,600
a combination of spanish and danish name

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
surnames

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,360
i have a theoretical degree in computer

37
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,680
science and mathematics

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:06,960
and on a daily basis i work mostly with

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,920
eu gdpr stuff and haskell and purescript

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,440
i like a lot uh open sourceness and also

41
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,958
this project is released under a

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
copylift license

43
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,319
which is made by the freestyle

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,760
foundation

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,920
and i have a meetup for functional

46
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,840
copenhagens in copenhagen which is

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,160
also one of my passions

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,920
so what i would like to show with this

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,680
talk is

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,920
sometimes when we tackle this kind of

51
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,959
task where we try to

52
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,720
find patterns or stuff inside

53
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,440
data containers that we actually don't

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,200
know what what they're all about

55
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,680
sometimes we forget there are actually

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,238
some tools that have some

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,680
really nice concept or constructs that i

58
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,040
can help us with is some

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,440
simplicity structure and correctness

60
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,959
by doing some some kind of testing and i

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,480
will try to show and convince you that

62
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,959
this is the case this is why

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,840
by using this tool i actually got a lot

64
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
a lot done

65
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,879
and almost for free

66
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,080
so i have spoken with some people that i

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,680
have met here at bone heck and most

68
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,120
people say you are you a bit crazy why

69
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,840
the heck do you just stare into some

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,159
bites

71
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,879
use some kind of debugger or disassembly

72
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,440
to get

73
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,319
those kind of information and for me it

74
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,760
was just like

75
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,599
doing some kind of um some kind of

76
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,840
reverse puzzle so i just wanted to see

77
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,879
if i can deconstruct this

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,120
data container information so

79
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,560
i'm just being sitting in an emacs with

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,840
the hexel mode

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
and of course you get a lot of water

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,480
fuck moments so

83
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
and it's important to notice that even

84
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,679
though

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,280
i had knowledge of of the game itself i

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,040
hadn't i didn't have any knowledge

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,239
whatsoever about this

88
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
this kind of data container

89
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,520
and i will be show some code but

90
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
hopefully it's

91
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,319
[Music]

92
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,679
close enough to english so most people

93
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,480
will be able to understand it even

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
though

95
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
they don't code on a daily basis

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,200
so about this background and like

97
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
two years ago like it was this 25th

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,480
anniversary of this a

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,080
football game or this this pc games that

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,760
almost got released at the same time as

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,680
windows 95 and

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,479
intel pentiums and it's mostly a

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,800
football manager which was simple enough

104
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,359
and

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,240
complex enough for many spaniards people

106
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
to to play

107
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,360
to to to play with it on the on the pcs

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
and if you know about spain's people

109
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
actually very passionate about footballs

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,719
it was just like

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,400
almost a match made in heaven so those

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
two brothers

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,960
whenever i put out the the slides

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,800
there's some

115
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,719
interviews in spanish where you can see

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,680
how it was how did they created all this

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
stuff

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,600
so one of the the the nice things for

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,479
myself is i'm a linux user so thanks to

120
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,440
wine

121
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,320
i was actually able to install this

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,080
old-school

123
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,840
pc game on my linux and i can actually

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,719
play the game again then i actually

125
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,039
discovered that it

126
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
exists like a community and this

127
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,000
community has for the last

128
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,639
25 years tried to keep this games up

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,240
to date with the newest players that

130
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,039
plays for these teams

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:22,080
and also update the teams on on this

132
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,680
on this game but what i notice is that

133
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,880
most of

134
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
this community helpers they were

135
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,039
actually

136
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,960
doing doing this from a

137
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,400
hexadecimal editor so they were just

138
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,400
converting with

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,159
calculators to find out what the

140
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,719
representation of a string is and then

141
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
they just

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,919
update the information directly as bytes

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,160
and it's a it's a very tedious and

144
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,479
manual and it's not error pro or it's

145
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
well you can get a lot of errors so it's

146
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,280
like

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,759
i thought to myself well we might be

148
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,880
able to do this better right so

149
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,759
400 teams and i think they say that it

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,360
takes

151
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:05,199
one a mandate per team so it's like

152
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,520
408 80 uh 80 days to update these teams

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,199
right so that's almost a year

154
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,799
of course they distribute it out to

155
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,199
other people and they can

156
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
they can do it faster so one of the

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,280
things they made this

158
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,039
such a genius move and i have it at the

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,318
bottom is that

160
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,520
they found a loophole hackers so instead

161
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,759
of

162
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,240
selling the game the pc game as a pc

163
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,840
game where you have to buy a higher vit

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
they found out they can actually sell it

165
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,679
as a magazine with a game

166
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,280
so the the magazines in spain you'd have

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,199
to pay less v80

168
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,479
and because the price was lesser more

169
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,319
people can buy the game

170
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,840
and this is one of the reasons besides

171
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,960
it was a good game

172
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,960
that it got so popular

173
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
so this is more or less what i had in

174
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,520
mind

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,359
that i wanted to do so main goal for

176
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,318
myself was to automat

177
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,919
automate as much as possible with regard

178
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,360
of this update in the data in the game

179
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,680
right

180
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,440
i already had like some notions of

181
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,680
electronic arts they had this

182
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,280
online database where you can just log

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,039
in and get all

184
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
kind of information from all these

185
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,639
football players

186
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,000
and it's free and you didn't need to do

187
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,919
any registration which is

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,680
kind of cool because i don't want them

189
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,758
to know that i'm actually doing this

190
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,560
stuff

191
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,080
sadly like one or two years ago they the

192
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,919
guys from electronic arts decided they

193
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,719
didn't want to update this api anymore

194
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,560
so

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,840
if you want legacy data when i put out

196
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
the slides you can just click on that

197
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,039
and you can actually retrieve the data

198
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
as it looked like two years ago

199
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,120
it's still active but they did they just

200
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,800
don't update it

201
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,800
then i found another alternative which

202
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,840
is more or less reusing the data from

203
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
from this api and this is actually the

204
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
one that i used

205
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,280
to do this game but what i notice is

206
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,280
that not all data is actually

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,878
populated to this api and i know it

208
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,198
because the data is

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
in the electronic arts but it's not in

210
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,560
the other one

211
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,318
and i might think this had to do with

212
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,199
some kind of business model so if you

213
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,759
want all the data you had to pay for it

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,479
other goals is that i really want this

215
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,440
to be an

216
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,878
open project so copy left license

217
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,719
whenever this was done i was just going

218
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,639
to put it out people can make new spawns

219
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,240
of this project they can take the code

220
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,280
they can modify it and they can make the

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280
community better right

222
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,878
so and finally i also wanted

223
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
people without any kind of knowledge in

224
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,479
programming

225
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,039
they should be able to update data maybe

226
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,159
there's some

227
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,199
areas in any of those apis so maybe end

228
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,360
users

229
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
let's say that you can do 90 or 95

230
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,919
automatically

231
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,959
and then you just need to do the five

232
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,958
percent manually

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,120
so several version of this game and i

234
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,839
have the main focus on the 6.0 because

235
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,839
for me

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,519
for many other people is like just the

237
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,600
best one of those games

238
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,640
but hopefully with the code out there

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,320
some people can

240
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,000
take it and get inspired to make for the

241
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,000
5.0 or the 7.0

242
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
so what is this pkf files everybody

243
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,160
asking

244
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,839
like i say if you google for it it's

245
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,880
going to appear like it was some kind of

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,240
adobe

247
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,959
data format and pkf is just this

248
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,760
data containers for both pc football and

249
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,640
pc

250
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,640
basket where they just store all this

251
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,000
kind of data

252
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,839
so what i discover like at the end not

253
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
at the beginning is that the pdf files

254
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,000
have

255
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,479
some sets of 32 pointers

256
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,120
and those 32 pointers point to some data

257
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
which can be

258
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
related to a team or can be related to

259
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,959
some kind of

260
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,640
players and so on and so forth right so

261
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,760
at the beginning i didn't know this one

262
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,839
so i was more or less like just guessing

263
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,560
and as i mentioned this is what i saw

264
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,000
initially i just started up emacs i just

265
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,079
took this pkf file as you see here

266
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,920
and this is just what you you can see so

267
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,959
you go down and so on and so forth oh

268
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,120
and then you can see here like a

269
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,680
copyright notice

270
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,240
so initially i found out that there's

271
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,160
like 484

272
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,399
copyright notices and i knew there was

273
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,880
484 um

274
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,640
teams in the game so i was just like hmm

275
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,320
that might be something right

276
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,279
so what i did it was just like chunk in

277
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,440
the file and taken from

278
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,640
here the copyright notice until the next

279
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,839
copyright notice

280
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,199
and then i knew well that has to be a

281
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,720
team

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,640
the problem with this approach is

283
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,839
even though i got some information from

284
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,120
these teams

285
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,040
i got a lot of errors and

286
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,959
and this is just like there was like

287
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
just guessing because i had no absolute

288
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,479
absolute no clue i didn't know this i

289
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,120
didn't know this yet i didn't know there

290
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,959
was some kind of point of zero

291
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,880
so this was my first approach just take

292
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,959
emacs put in hexel mode and just try to

293
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,800
look into the bytes

294
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,800
of course with my parser and to the

295
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,959
people who are not familiar with passers

296
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,399
passes just when we try to analyze like

297
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,160
a sequence of

298
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,320
bytes or charts or whatever it is and we

299
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,920
try to like conform that into

300
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,600
like a set of rules and then place it

301
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,519
into an ast an ast is an abstract syntax

302
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
tree which is just like a

303
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,959
like can you say some kind of data

304
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,360
structure where you're able to put in

305
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,239
like

306
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,839
um data that you get out of this

307
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,440
sequence of bytes or

308
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,399
chars so then i actually understood

309
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,720
because

310
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,000
i went back back back into looking into

311
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,000
all these bytes and what i noticed is

312
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,120
there's like this repeating pattern here

313
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,640
right

314
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,240
one ta italy italy one ta one ta

315
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,000
and the small is the same so what i did

316
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,959
is i just took chunks of this

317
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
information

318
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,399
and i begin to put it together and then

319
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,800
i was like whoa there's 32

320
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,480
32 is normally a number which is 2 to

321
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,639
the power i think is 5 if i don't

322
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
remember incorrectly but what i begin to

323
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,200
discover is that there was some kind of

324
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
information

325
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,560
in this values here so it was starting

326
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,920
here

327
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,599
as zero two and so on and so forth

328
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,000
and what i discovered in this pointers

329
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,200
um

330
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,560
is actually that there was this

331
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
information about um

332
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:26,639
where is it yeah so you had like um

333
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,399
so in this pointers you had like a

334
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
unique identifier which is like the

335
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,160
unique identifier for each team

336
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,440
then you had like the offset from the

337
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,560
beginning of the file and then you have

338
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,839
like the size

339
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,399
of the data chunks as i was mentioning

340
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,880
before

341
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,760
so this made it even easier because once

342
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,120
i

343
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,040
noticed that okay so there are some

344
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,839
pointers right and the pointers are some

345
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,599
data chunks at the

346
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,959
end there's some kind of point

347
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,040
terminator

348
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,959
some empty box and then just the last

349
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,439
data

350
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,719
so once i realized that i only had three

351
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,639
errors

352
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,639
when i was running my parser and i

353
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,760
discovered that there might be some

354
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,959
what can you say some intended

355
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
box so if people try to extract

356
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,518
information as i do

357
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,240
you cannot just do it with one single

358
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,000
pattern so this is one of the good

359
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
things about having this say tools with

360
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
the

361
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,079
parser combinators that you can just

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,720
choose something called alternative so

363
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,560
you can define

364
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,920
several patterns that you can actually

365
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,680
look for and can do some

366
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,639
backtracking going back and try some

367
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,638
other cases

368
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,519
and my final approach was that i was

369
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,518
trying to

370
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,200
instantiate those unique ids from these

371
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,920
pkf files

372
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,000
while i was passing and that might be a

373
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,959
wrong approach because this a

374
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,360
unique identifiers it was not um the

375
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,160
same

376
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,320
approach for all the the pkf files so

377
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,199
what i did is i just do that on a later

378
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,959
when i need to

379
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,560
when i need the unique identifiers for

380
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,518
specific pkfs

381
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:04,800
i will just use it in in that sense

382
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:17,839
so another thing that i noticed is that

383
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:17,839
all the texts accept this information

384
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,079
this copyright notice from dynamics

385
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
multimedia

386
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,199
so except that that's the only

387
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,720
understandable text that there are in

388
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,040
this file but

389
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,639
there was this rotation a file that i

390
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,639
found in one of the

391
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
other projects code and i actually

392
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,440
noticed that

393
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,800
they had like two to encode or uh the

394
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,120
code but

395
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,240
i i i soon realized it was just a

396
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,160
rotation

397
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,000
so my function if you rotate and you

398
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,680
take the byte you get the bytes back

399
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,680
so when i did that and i noticed that i

400
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,680
say i might be on to something right

401
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,839
so so one of the things is once you have

402
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,320
the data in this a

403
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:07,199
ast this abstract syntax tree

404
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,199
high multifaceted

405
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,560
so once you have this data once you have

406
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,839
passed it correctly in the different

407
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,040
branches in the different

408
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,839
intended box uh

409
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,760
the next step is well we want to have it

410
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,880
in this nice way of seeing it in the ast

411
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,839
but we also want to be able to recreate

412
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,759
this binaries

413
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,680
once again so what i noticed is that um

414
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,440
dynamics multimedia instead of making

415
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,920
this big file every time they had some

416
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,959
kind of

417
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,759
um changes to to to the data they just

418
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,800
made these delta files called dbc's

419
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,320
so once i realized that a dbc is

420
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,279
just one of these chunks without the

421
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,040
pointers

422
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,639
so this is uh well

423
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,399
one of these ones oh it's just easier to

424
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,320
do this one of these single

425
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,079
themes is just a dbc in itself but you

426
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,959
just need to ensure that it doesn't have

427
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,040
the pointer

428
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:08,079
and you need to make like some a bit

429
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,560
um change so it actually noticed that

430
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,680
it's like um a dbc file and it's just

431
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,560
two bytes changed to

432
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,560
that you need to do that

433
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,120
so this is also one of the other

434
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,240
constructs that i

435
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,240
really happy that i can use because i

436
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,519
use this kind of tool is

437
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,000
i just need to like define for each of

438
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,680
my

439
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,279
data types and this is just the basic

440
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,560
data types so

441
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,759
boolean word 8 word 16 word 32 and

442
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,399
strings

443
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,399
i just actually just defined that my

444
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,440
byte stream that i want to get out of

445
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,279
this

446
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,720
data i can just define it as

447
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,880
by implementing this function called

448
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,399
bytes and the good thing about this this

449
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,680
afterwards you can just do recursively

450
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,120
so as long as you

451
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:59,040
keep concatenating all these

452
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,759
sub data types from your data

453
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,639
it will do it in a nice and easily and

454
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,400
readable

455
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,000
way afterwards so here is this

456
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,600
maybe it's a bit like the complex one is

457
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,039
the string and i think it's a bit too

458
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,799
small but hey

459
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,879
it's a picture sorry i cannot make it

460
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,039
any bigger

461
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,959
so the way i do with strings is i just

462
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,480
store the information of

463
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,079
um of the length of the string

464
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,480
in a word 16 and then i just take

465
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,440
all the bytes and i just rotate it as i

466
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
show before but i

467
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,840
only do it once so this way when it gets

468
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,160
into the game it automatically gets to

469
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,159
rotate it back in and then it's like a

470
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,520
readable text from the game

471
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,520
just going to take another slurk of

472
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
order

473
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,080
so yes as i say at the beginning i tried

474
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,120
to mimic or

475
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,280
recreate this big pkf file with all this

476
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,879
information and one once i updated it i

477
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,600
needed also to update

478
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,960
the pointers uh offset and also like the

479
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,520
the sizes

480
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,240
so this is why i decided well why not

481
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,520
just

482
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,039
stay with the dbc and also one of the

483
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,320
good things is that

484
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,840
some of this teams have some extra

485
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
information which is

486
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,120
not relevant anymore like you have to

487
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,639
understand that this game was

488
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,479
popular back in the days where like the

489
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
internet was

490
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,440
not very popular so there was a lot of

491
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,480
data that people didn't have access to

492
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,840
so in order to generate this

493
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,080
small dbcs i just removed all that stuff

494
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,678
because

495
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,399
i distributed this this update of data

496
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,799
through

497
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,919
like a service so i'm really interested

498
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,440
in having as small dbc's as possible

499
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:59,360
and as i mentioned you only need to

500
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,720
ensure that it it's a dbc file just by

501
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,678
changing two bytes

502
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,679
it's as simple as that

503
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:12,559
so now i'm actually able to take

504
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,320
the data files i can extract the data in

505
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,960
something that's readable for

506
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,639
human people we can make the changes and

507
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,400
now i can make the delta files and when

508
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,039
i take the delta files

509
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
they can be read by the game so already

510
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,160
i have the mechanism

511
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
to update data but it's still a manual

512
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,559
process so now we have to do this

513
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,559
manually

514
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,360
so the next step would be is just to go

515
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:37,120
this api called food best

516
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,240
and there was a lot of a

517
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,840
json data that gets uh downloaded or

518
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,760
or this service actually provides you

519
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,520
with a job of

520
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,000
json so what i did is just um

521
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,840
as the workshop that simon shine had the

522
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,720
other days just use this tool called j

523
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,280
cube which is pretty fast it's written

524
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,640
in c

525
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,280
and it's it just has the necessary like

526
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,480
possibilities to to resharp your data

527
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,158
from a bass

528
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,679
from a bash or from a terminal or by

529
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,320
script

530
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,039
also like i use a lot of curl and a v

531
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,760
get

532
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,760
to get all this png files afterwards

533
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,080
because like data is like data

534
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,000
information

535
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,280
of the players and the teams has stored

536
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,600
in a json format

537
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,879
but like the pictures of the players is

538
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,879
stored in png files

539
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,880
so one of the things that you notice is

540
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,559
that they have like this

541
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,200
unique setup for the images

542
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,240
and it's of course they try to obfuscate

543
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,400
the text

544
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,600
but they also try to obfuscate like the

545
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,080
the colors

546
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
so this is why i made the logo of this

547
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,678
project like

548
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,879
the color palette from dynamics

549
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,039
multimedia

550
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
and this is something that i extracted

551
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,960
and

552
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
[Music]

553
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,159
when i while i was searching for this

554
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,840
there was like a very similar

555
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,520
question with regard maul is the same

556
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,399
that's that i was doing

557
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,960
on the image magic forum so i was just

558
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,600
like

559
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,440
hmm maybe somebody else did this a few

560
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,199
years ago

561
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,039
so um i have like a script that is able

562
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,240
to generate this a

563
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,280
bmp file and and i also have to make

564
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,360
another

565
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,360
tool that transformed

566
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,280
the bitmap as it is maybe it's four or

567
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,678
five but it will take it back to the

568
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,399
version three which is the one that they

569
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,000
use in the

570
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,360
in the in the community and you have to

571
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,919
understand what they do they take like a

572
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,399
picture

573
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,840
of a player from a website they put it

574
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,120
into the measurement

575
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,720
they need for the game and then

576
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,479
and and it's important uh they write

577
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,720
they need to use this tool called um

578
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,000
paint from windows xp and it has to be a

579
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,799
paint from windows xp

580
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
so they have like a what is it oh it's

581
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,000
not a darker but it's

582
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
like some kind of a virtual uh

583
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,720
environment where they can run this too

584
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,158
so also because i need to distribute

585
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,679
this afterwards like

586
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,360
i can see that it's storing all the

587
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,240
bytes all the pixels as

588
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,760
four bytes and i can see that the alpha

589
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,960
layer is never used by

590
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:21,280
by the bmps so i thought well

591
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,280
i already understood the bmp um

592
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,120
specification i was using microsoft's

593
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
website which is

594
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,399
which was a pretty good well-documented

595
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,199
way of

596
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,559
describing this pnp so it's just so well

597
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,400
why not use like the version

598
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,960
two where we only have three bytes per

599
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,080
color so we don't we're not using alpha

600
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,440
so it might be able to save 260 bytes

601
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,918
because you have to understand that it's

602
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,799
just like the index of the colors and

603
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,480
then you have just

604
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:52,400
a pointer to each index so

605
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,080
i i was able to reduce per picture 256

606
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,080
bytes and you might say well that's not

607
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,678
that's not a lot but when you make 10

608
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,720
000 images that's actually

609
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,280
quite some some bytes that you that you

610
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,280
actually save

611
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,720
and once you have both the dbc

612
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,480
files and you have the image files in a

613
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,320
smaller size well

614
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,240
i don't want to use too much of a to

615
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,360
clean service so

616
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,880
at the moment it's 13 megabytes and

617
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,959
i just push it i'll push it up to

618
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,559
hostfile.i and

619
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,440
you can get the latest latest version

620
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:31,520
and like i say i probably owe

621
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,360
a tickling an alcohol tsunami afterwards

622
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,400
because it's a free service and i am

623
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:41,840
allowed to host my

624
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:45,440
my update of the data from his service

625
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,360
so a month ago i gave

626
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,120
this talk but it was more focused on a

627
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,959
demo because i wanted to show this for

628
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,719
the community because i expect those

629
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,799
people to be the ones that

630
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,880
are going to use this tool so i gave

631
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,400
this talk in spanish

632
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,240
and it was like a pretty long one three

633
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,720
hours and it was very deep dive into

634
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,720
code and

635
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,919
because it's limited the time here in

636
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,320
bonn hager tried to abstract it a bit

637
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,840
more because not everybody here codes

638
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,279
so so this is when i took the code as it

639
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,279
was and i put it public

640
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,640
onto gitlab i just made it from private

641
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,480
to to public

642
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
and what is what is the thing that

643
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,120
happened so

644
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,840
main goal automat as much as possible i

645
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,760
think

646
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,760
that downloading all the images and all

647
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,879
the data and running the script to

648
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,000
update

649
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:36,159
it will take like maybe half an hour

650
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,320
compared to 480 uh

651
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,600
hours to update or days to update all

652
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,520
the teams which is

653
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,439
i would say it's a pretty good factor uh

654
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
reduced

655
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,720
the thing about this api which is like

656
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,559
it's legacy

657
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,240
what i noticed is as soon as this got

658
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,879
out this api

659
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,279
was used and disappear in like one week

660
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,440
so

661
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,480
maybe a lot of people try this out and

662
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,840
the person

663
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,159
or the company hosting this api just

664
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,080
decided

665
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,200
well i don't want to pay all this money

666
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,000
to all these people

667
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,279
downloading all this stuff so it just

668
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
disappeared

669
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,279
so that means that a lot of the job i

670
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,039
did passing this api with

671
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,679
jq and so on it's totally useless now so

672
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,039
until i find another api where i can do

673
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,840
this

674
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,360
well the product is a bit dead but at

675
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,480
least i have all the data

676
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,479
locally one of the other girls or goals

677
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,159
was for me to put this out as an open

678
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,159
source project and

679
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,600
hopefully people will be able to use

680
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,279
this and

681
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,639
i got one of my friends to actually

682
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,919
commit code

683
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,159
with regard of some some

684
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,520
abstraction that i was not bright enough

685
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,799
to do myself and

686
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,799
he did it in like in a very simple way

687
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,480
the one of the thing is so you can see

688
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,440
i'm one of those guys who actually sit

689
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,919
in a

690
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,880
terminal right as many of us here are

691
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,240
hackers we

692
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,640
are happy with our linux and our

693
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,520
terminals and i don't need a user

694
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,520
interface if i

695
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,840
if i can avoid it right but when you go

696
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,679
to like people that don't code and

697
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,520
people that are used to use

698
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,720
hexadecimal editors they want some kind

699
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,000
of ui so they can actually

700
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,880
be used or like utilize this as

701
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,799
a way to as they used right but i think

702
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,720
it's like a

703
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,799
impossible task to make a nice user

704
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
interface that is cross-platform that

705
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,918
will work on linux

706
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,440
mac and windows so this is why i don't

707
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,760
think that would be

708
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,279
a goal for me also i would also find it

709
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,720
a bit difficult to

710
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,720
to put the effort into like

711
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,440
a user interface because how will i

712
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,159
script it

713
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,799
the whole point of me doing this is that

714
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,640
we need to

715
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,080
update as much as possible so we can get

716
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,159
like let's say 95

717
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,120
is getting updated by this script and

718
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,919
code

719
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,360
well the last five percent well we

720
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,640
should probably use the effort in

721
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,080
some kind of a editor and uh

722
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,159
the problem i see it right now is that

723
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
when i store all this information i

724
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,600
store it in a big

725
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,520
file and that file it's like 30

726
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,279
megabytes and it's a bit like

727
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,799
a bit too difficult to to work around

728
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,679
with so i'm trying to maybe make it

729
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,240
smaller

730
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,120
so each team has a folder with its

731
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
players

732
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,199
and then you can just copy the player

733
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,960
from one folder to the other folder

734
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,279
if you want to move him from one team to

735
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,480
another but again this is just

736
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,120
open for for discussion

737
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,159
so from my main goals i got something

738
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,279
good and i got

739
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,919
more or less too wrong because the api

740
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,039
disappear

741
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,360
and using like a terminal

742
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,879
editor or emacs or whatever this is not

743
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,639
what most people

744
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,480
expect to use when you work with stuff

745
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:52,640
like this

746
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:55,919
so it was not all two baddies so

747
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,279
i had two threads on this

748
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:02,880
forum as i mentioned in the abstract

749
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,520
and if you just sort by punctuation like

750
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,960
a

751
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,039
raiding there's only two

752
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,080
threats on that subforum that has five

753
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,520
stars

754
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,158
and i know we're in denmark you're not

755
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:18,000
supposed to brag about yourself but

756
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:20,080
i just thought it was uh kind of funny

757
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
but it's like a so if anybody

758
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,199
understands spanish or just put them

759
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,559
through google translate and you can

760
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,000
actually see how

761
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,918
that question i was asking at the

762
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,880
beginning was just like totally noob

763
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,360
question because i had

764
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,080
no clue what so what uh what i was doing

765
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,279
and then

766
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,760
after looking into this bites for many

767
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,279
months

768
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,679
and just realizing what all this

769
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,240
information was it was just like

770
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,799
you can see how it become more and more

771
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,880
clever

772
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,158
oh this is what happened in just sharing

773
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,840
with other people right

774
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:51,760
so this is what i wanted to do because

775
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,199
maybe in one year maybe in two months

776
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,520
maybe in two weeks

777
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,640
i'm not going to play with this game

778
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,360
again but maybe

779
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,720
somebody else is going to do it and also

780
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,719
like i got like

781
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,200
i think it was a thumbs up on my profile

782
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,200
it was say

783
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,240
this this is what i do is one of the

784
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,360
best thing that happened for

785
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,399
editing this data in many years again

786
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,158
don't brag in denmark is not what you do

787
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:27,840
is this gentile right

788
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:27,840
we're going to take a bit more water

789
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,440
so one of the things that was a bit um

790
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,960
and i can say it's holds and maybe simon

791
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,000
can recognize like

792
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,159
the github logo at the top

793
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,640
right so one of the things that um

794
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,840
that differs a bit from a this old

795
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,799
school game and

796
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,320
the fifa api is that there is like see

797
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,158
how many parameters they use to

798
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,279
calculate that average right

799
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,039
in the pc football you only have three

800
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,679
so what i wanted to do is i really want

801
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,440
to have that average like 93

802
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,440
but i wanted to be able to recreate it

803
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,720
with those exact values

804
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,039
so this is like the simplistic

805
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,840
just like the overall information that

806
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,879
sebastian

807
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,320
made for for this algorithm but what you

808
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,720
do is like you get

809
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,720
some kind of uniform

810
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,199
distribution of all the values so you

811
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,719
don't have two long gaps

812
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,600
so if this 93 it will not go to

813
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,120
maybe 53 when it goes over it will

814
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,240
always be maybe 94

815
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,479
or 92 or 91 so we ensure that we still

816
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,600
get like the same average rating

817
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,720
but we don't make those values in the

818
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,399
game too

819
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,640
too separated from what they really are

820
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:49,360
right

821
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,480
and i don't know not many people here

822
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,158
likes football but after

823
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,760
yesterday they might have to remove the

824
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:57,039
rating of this player

825
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,279
so put it lower

826
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,279
but it was kind of nice and sometimes

827
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,360
you have your own

828
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,360
network people that just see stuff

829
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,840
clearly so once code go

830
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,600
go online they just have open

831
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,199
possibilities to see how it is and might

832
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,199
be able to say well

833
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,279
why don't you try this i mean the way i

834
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,399
was doing it i was actually

835
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,120
getting um some kind of overflow in the

836
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,559
values

837
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,639
is because they store this information

838
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,600
in the game as a byte so they have like

839
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,120
this

840
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,879
built-in soft soft

841
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,239
mechanism to ensure that you never get

842
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,200
above 99

843
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,159
in the code but what if an i in the data

844
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,760
bite just put

845
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,440
255 255 right so i tried to do that for

846
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,559
all the parameters in the game and i

847
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,480
think it was like

848
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,799
the player was very costly and it has

849
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,399
like an insane salary so

850
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,840
the game more or less understand it with

851
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,360
the logic but there was some players

852
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,720
like the young players that it actually

853
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,600
got like um

854
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,399
boggy and the game at some point crest

855
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,678
so

856
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,639
at least this algorithm that sebastian

857
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,640
did was pretty cool

858
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,879
uh afterwards so what you need to

859
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,159
understand is that this is a game from

860
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,640
1997.

861
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,519
so when you take the news data and you

862
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,039
update it

863
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,440
some of the players actually not even

864
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,480
born in that year right so

865
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,679
well let's say they are born in 2001. so

866
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,960
they will actually have some minus

867
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,720
eight but the thing is it's not

868
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,720
represented in the game as a

869
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,399
integers it doesn't give sense to have

870
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,279
minus 12 years old right

871
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,840
so what it was i think it was a word 32

872
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,039
and

873
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,678
some of the players had like a 3 billion

874
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,600
years

875
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,360
or something like that was it couldn't

876
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,158
even fit in the screen

877
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,918
so it's what it was kind of funny so i

878
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,760
didn't want to talk

879
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,519
take any kind of changes to the manager

880
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,840
because i didn't want to distribute the

881
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,360
the binary itself but what i ended up

882
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,240
doing is in this

883
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,879
pcx youtubes i just made some extra

884
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,720
tooling that can patch the original

885
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,640
binary file and it will actually update

886
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,679
it and i really had like this problem

887
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,039
because for me like

888
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,640
i was just thinking well the game was

889
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,720
from 1997 so what if i just moved 1997

890
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,159
to 2019 right

891
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,720
i didn't know that it was actually a

892
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:16,399
calendar so you have to put 1997

893
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,600
to 2019 and then 2000 in oh sorry

894
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,439
1998 to 2020. so

895
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,120
i was only updating the first value so i

896
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,120
had like a strange calendar that was

897
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,719
going from 2019

898
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,239
to 1998 of course after a few

899
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,399
clicks on the mouse everything

900
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,320
everything just crashed right

901
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,719
another of the ones that i got to patch

902
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:38,480
was this um

903
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,679
and this was the problematic one because

904
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,200
there were some players that were born

905
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,200
in 2002

906
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,279
and the game is had this internal

907
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,320
mechanism that actually

908
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,320
says everything before 9 1900

909
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,799
i just randomized the birthday of the

910
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,678
players everything after 2000 i just

911
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,000
randomized the

912
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,360
the the birthday of the players so you

913
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,880
had young players that were actually

914
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,080
older than the older players which is a

915
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,000
bit like

916
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,279
but i knew because i've been updating

917
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,320
the values and i actually knew i could

918
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,840
put it down to

919
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:11,040
900 to 2000 and by the power of

920
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,799
emacs i just made one search could you

921
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,000
please make a with regular expression i

922
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,240
was just saying

923
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,280
please look for the hexadecimal values

924
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,279
of 1900

925
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,280
and 2000. i knew there was some kind of

926
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,000
if logic there that says if it's less

927
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,919
than this or

928
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,119
greater than this you have to call the

929
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,520
randomized function right

930
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,599
that was like that was pretty obvious

931
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,199
and when i run this a

932
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,720
greedy version where i was just trying

933
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,040
to ensure that those two

934
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,839
hex values was as close as possible

935
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,199
there was only

936
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,199
one place in this a

937
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,040
binary file right so i just changed it

938
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,158
to those values and whooped it it just

939
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,239
worked

940
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,800
so it initially i just put it into two

941
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,879
thought or two to zero instead of one

942
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,800
but what i realized is that when they

943
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,918
didn't knew the the birthday of

944
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,280
some player because this is 1997 and

945
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,240
they didn't have access to

946
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,720
to the internet they put like this age

947
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,520
of

948
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,680
1900 so they can get a randomized number

949
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,880
and i think the range is between 25 and

950
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,480
maybe

951
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,960
29 right but what happened is that then

952
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,640
i had

953
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,160
players in the game that was born in

954
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,480
1900

955
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,000
and it was 2090 so they were pretty old

956
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,400
so i had like players

957
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
120 years old playing the game which was

958
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,520
a bit like

959
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,320
uh not pretty good so that's why i leave

960
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,640
like this

961
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,400
to one and then i go update all the

962
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,799
dates and i just put it to

963
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,800
zero

964
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,078
so i don't know the problem with

965
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,599
exponent

966
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,320
and last time i played this more

967
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,200
seriously

968
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,800
i was using cubes which comes with xfce

969
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,919
that has built into this

970
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,640
uh what's called

971
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
well the manager the windows manager so

972
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,680
they had this built in

973
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,520
zoom so i can just mark like a spot of

974
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,040
my screen and consume it out

975
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,040
so maybe if you see it like this

976
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,040
it's too small to see right

977
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,640
so they had like all this stuff so i

978
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,040
just want to show like this is a

979
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,400
friendly match and this is spanish so

980
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,520
you probably don't understand it unless

981
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,119
you speak the language but you can see

982
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,079
here are two teams so

983
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,079
if i just take them

984
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,320
and i go into there

985
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,599
so you can see we're still in 1997 this

986
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,839
is pretty

987
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,640
maybe too small for you but hey it says

988
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,320
1997 this is when the game was released

989
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,118
and if we look into here we can see that

990
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,119
the the goalkeeper he was 28 years right

991
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,839
so let's start up the binary where we

992
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,839
patched it

993
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,200
wine and then this just this is one of

994
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,160
the good things about using linux is

995
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,279
because

996
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,920
manager with all lowercase

997
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,320
is just another file on the system but

998
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,000
if you

999
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,680
if this wasn't uh linux you would just

1000
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,800
overwrite the the manager with all

1001
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,279
uppercases

1002
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,440
so i can still keep the the original

1003
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,599
manager file but i can just make my own

1004
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,960
which is the patch one

1005
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,960
so if we go in again

1006
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,920
so he was 28 years right so now we can

1007
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,440
see we're in 2019

1008
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,280
and of course like the player he has to

1009
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,119
be a bit older

1010
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,520
and now you can see it's 50 which is a

1011
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,359
more or less what i would expect so now

1012
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,640
we would like to get like

1013
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,720
a data from

1014
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,400
this service and i have all the data

1015
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,640
local because like this data doesn't

1016
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,000
exist anymore online

1017
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,480
and i don't think we will look into this

1018
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,480
one anymore

1019
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,480
football so what i did is i just

1020
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,160
wrapped all this uh different leaks

1021
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,240
based on this tooling

1022
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,240
so i just say let's for the sake of it

1023
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,160
just make for the spanish

1024
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:06,319
first division we can run the script

1025
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:10,399
and it should be maybe a few minutes

1026
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,599
so what i do is i uh based on the json

1027
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,240
with jq i use this raw format to create

1028
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,440
my own

1029
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,640
um a representation of the abstract

1030
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,480
syntax tree

1031
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,240
and this information afterwards i put it

1032
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,320
into my applications

1033
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,399
and there i can transform it with the

1034
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,359
the thing i show before the type classes

1035
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,280
where i can

1036
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,359
make the byte string with the bytes for

1037
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,760
each of these data representations

1038
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,839
so this is all everything i'm doing so

1039
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,119
taking extracting the json format for

1040
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,839
the teams and the players

1041
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,440
i merge them together so the players

1042
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,839
goes under the team

1043
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,359
i convert them into this delta for each

1044
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,720
team

1045
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,920
i transform the images i'm sure they

1046
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,200
actually bmp2

1047
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,520
ensure they actually live up to and i

1048
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,598
also like to show like how the picture

1049
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,320
is very good quality now because it's 20

1050
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,560
20

1051
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,599
compared to the small size that we need

1052
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,078
in

1053
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:09,680
in this in this

1054
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:15,839
game so i think it takes a

1055
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,839
few minutes but shouldn't be fast enough

1056
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,720
i can take us

1057
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,760
so while this is working a bit i had

1058
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,760
like uh

1059
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,560
so in order to do a this project i

1060
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,119
needed to write my own parser as you do

1061
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,520
so this this this tool i'm using here

1062
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,160
has the the possibility to use this but

1063
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,800
other new tools on the block like rust

1064
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,960
and so on

1065
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,440
can do more or less the same so it's

1066
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:56,079
just um

1067
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,599
it's it's very i will say it's very

1068
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,359
it's very good that it's like more of

1069
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,960
this kind of tooling that we can use to

1070
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,440
make all this kind of a

1071
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,079
guessing into the into the values of

1072
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,319
some

1073
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,000
obscure data because this was just a

1074
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,359
hobby right this is just something okay

1075
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,720
i can help on this one but we

1076
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,240
some sometimes meet uh old or legacy

1077
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,399
systems that have a lot of

1078
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,160
stuff that we don't know so maybe just

1079
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,359
by using this kind of techniques where

1080
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,598
we can

1081
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,400
guess some kind of patterns or some kind

1082
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,040
of um

1083
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,240
information in this kind of toolings and

1084
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,240
we can actually maybe

1085
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,399
uh as i as i mentioned we can get some

1086
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,319
kind of simplicity and we can get

1087
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
correctness what is actually here and we

1088
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,880
can just stare into those um

1089
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,839
those values and i think i also want to

1090
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,440
show like

1091
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,839
uh this one just for the fun of it

1092
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,839
six

1093
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:55,920
types maybe just pause

1094
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,440
so so what the the way i do this is just

1095
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,319
i took a chunk

1096
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,319
from this file

1097
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,920
and what i did is i just

1098
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,119
in debug mode i just went for each of

1099
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,720
the bytes i was guessing what this was

1100
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,839
so i know this was a pid

1101
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,520
like a player unique identifier then i

1102
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:17,040
found out well this is the name this is

1103
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,359
the size of the string

1104
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,119
this is the reverse byte with my

1105
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,078
algorithm i know this

1106
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,359
string of hexadecimal is just cachito

1107
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,119
cachito is the

1108
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,359
the name in uppercase which is like the

1109
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,599
nickname of the player

1110
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,240
indexes roles citizenship which is like

1111
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,880
some kind of

1112
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,959
a identifier from the from the

1113
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,160
from the country we have position hair

1114
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,680
color birthday

1115
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,680
you can see he's one of those that had

1116
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,720
like the 1900s

1117
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,118
so now that i patched this game i need

1118
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,279
to

1119
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,040
update his birthday as well and then the

1120
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,599
hate and so on and so forth

1121
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,160
so i went slavically for only one

1122
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,960
instance

1123
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,920
per data element and once you have this

1124
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,599
stuff

1125
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:08,560
represented in your party combinator

1126
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,560
you can just reuse this all the time and

1127
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,960
and i think this is pretty documenting

1128
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,359
so we know that well the skin color

1129
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,440
or maybe the hair color well the person

1130
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,040
is a blonde a bold a black

1131
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,200
hair gray hair and so on and sometimes

1132
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,880
because it's represented as a bite

1133
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,598
it happens that well maybe they put in

1134
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,040
some kind of

1135
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,560
um error and purpose

1136
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,720
so you couldn't pass this one and then

1137
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,200
you know that it was like oh invalid

1138
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
value

1139
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,399
i didn't find any one of those but i

1140
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,319
would really like to get this

1141
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,839
failed message whenever i was running

1142
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,119
this tool and then i can just put in a

1143
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,839
placeholder it's just like

1144
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,839
unknown hair

1145
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,599
so let's go to the shell

1146
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,920
yeah so now it's actually done it made

1147
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:59,839
all the player images everything

1148
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,839
so if i go in and say fiona

1149
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:13,839
uh

1150
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,280
yeah so if we just go in and look into

1151
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,680
the

1152
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,760
this is actually the brand for a team so

1153
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,560
if we do like this

1154
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,200
we can see that all these pictures have

1155
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,640
very

1156
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:34,879
low bad quality right but this is

1157
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,598
necessary because i think there's 32

1158
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,160
times 32 but this is what the game needs

1159
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,880
and this

1160
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,160
like the colors from this is actually

1161
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,760
patch already with this

1162
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:47,759
um this palette scheme

1163
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,839
but if we look into how the quality is

1164
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,839
actually with um

1165
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:13,119
images maybe yes oh clubs yes

1166
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:16,160
this one so we can see this is actually

1167
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,480
a way better quality right but

1168
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,359
this this all this uh logos or brands

1169
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,720
for the teams

1170
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,400
this is not supported by like an

1171
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,720
old-school game so this is why

1172
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,720
we need to do this for all the brands of

1173
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,319
the clubs but also like for the 10 000

1174
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,799
players

1175
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,240
and i mean this is okay it's cool that

1176
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,520
we do it with the paint but i'd rather

1177
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,359
do this all automatically right

1178
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,560
so this is like the power if you combine

1179
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,440
like a

1180
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,480
jq with curl we get and then the thing

1181
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,000
that you didn't

1182
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,599
that you were not able to do with this

1183
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,920
kind of tooling well

1184
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,839
you can just write your own applications

1185
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,839
for that

1186
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,200
and i think

1187
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,359
so did we see no okay so i just want to

1188
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,359
show you how to

1189
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:11,440
recursively you copy from food data

1190
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,440
everything to the game

1191
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,399
so now if you recall if i run my own

1192
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,319
patch version

1193
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,240
and we shouldn't get more this a

1194
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:25,839
goalkeeper that was 50 years old right

1195
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,439
we should get like a

1196
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,480
another goalkeeper and he probably

1197
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,359
shouldn't be

1198
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,680
older that 30 years old so i think it

1199
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:38,000
was

1200
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:38,000
in real madrid and we take this one

1201
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,799
and now we can already see that the the

1202
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,399
the goalkeeper

1203
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,000
that i was shown before he was actually

1204
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,720
from spain and he was

1205
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,319
50 years old and now we have a player

1206
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,200
from belgium

1207
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,759
and he's 25 years old so now we actually

1208
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,359
have the

1209
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,160
the update and we can see this is the

1210
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:00,720
algorithm that sebastian wrote

1211
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,118
so none of those values actually exceed

1212
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,598
99 anymore because they actually bought

1213
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,280
they actually bugged out the game so

1214
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,119
this is small as a realistic and if you

1215
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,760
go to the fifa api

1216
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,800
this value actually matches and the

1217
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,800
picture actually

1218
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,400
removed like the background to make a

1219
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,800
better contrast between like the

1220
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,040
the picture of the person and also like

1221
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,880
i put like a black border because it did

1222
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:25,440
this um

1223
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,000
this window here was white and if i put

1224
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,880
like this

1225
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,440
contrast in white it was blending to to

1226
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
too bad

1227
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,640
but all this is stuff you can do in the

1228
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,200
matte magic so you just say put a border

1229
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,960
and just

1230
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,480
make this a a alpha channel white just

1231
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,560
remove it and put in a black

1232
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,520
and a white color so all this can just

1233
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,920
be scripted right

1234
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,280
and then just run it so it took like two

1235
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,920
three minutes to do like the first

1236
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,680
division

1237
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
and if i run everything it's just take

1238
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,520
15 minutes and if i have to download

1239
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,000
if it was possible to download the data

1240
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:58,240
again all this process

1241
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:02,079
would take less than 30 minutes which is

1242
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,720
way better than 480 manpower

1243
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,960
days to to update the game i mean it was

1244
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,160
one person that had to update it

1245
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,200
like every year all these teams change

1246
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,040
uh players so once you

1247
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,319
not done everything you have done it was

1248
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,759
just a waste of time because you have to

1249
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,800
start over again right

1250
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,359
so i hope this could help out but now we

1251
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,760
have this

1252
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,680
situation that we need to find another

1253
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,920
api there's actually a german service

1254
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,359
and i try to reach out to them but i

1255
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,640
haven't heard back from them

1256
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,160
so the the thing about this service

1257
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,759
the german service is that you need to

1258
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,118
register yourself

1259
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,280
and then you need to get a premium

1260
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,640
account and i can already hear that

1261
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,359
premium account means

1262
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,839
they have to pay some stuff and but

1263
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,839
let's see

1264
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:49,839
how it ends up so my home point of this

1265
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:53,440
is that

1266
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:55,920
some of these tools that we we use and

1267
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,240
i'm not a guy who usually go into this

1268
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,839
stuff because when i talk with people

1269
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,399
at this bone hack where they used to do

1270
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,558
more or less

1271
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,520
some kind of stuff like this and they

1272
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,119
just say well

1273
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,720
why don't you use like a debugger why

1274
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,400
don't you just disassemble it why don't

1275
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,959
you just do this and didn't that

1276
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,480
but i just thought can i just for the

1277
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,079
fun of it hey

1278
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,920
i had to do something under the the

1279
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,599
kovit times right so can i just

1280
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,520
look into bites and can i just see

1281
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,960
information can i go can i just get

1282
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,800
patterns out of this

1283
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,680
and am i able to represent those

1284
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,920
patterns those findings that i see in a

1285
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,720
in a in a structural way so i can

1286
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,240
actually

1287
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,799
reuse this lawyer can i do some um

1288
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,680
well it's not this one but it's this one

1289
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,680
or this one or

1290
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,040
this one this one or this one is there a

1291
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,118
way that i can do this in

1292
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,880
in languages or like tools like this is

1293
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,000
actually something that allows this one

1294
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,640
and as i say i'm not using rust but rust

1295
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,400
is one of the

1296
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,400
the languages that can do this as well

1297
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:00,839
and i think this was my last slide so if

1298
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,839
anybody has any

1299
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,839
questions

1300
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,880
so what happened is that every year

1301
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,800
it decides if somebody is above 33 or 35

1302
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,000
they actually say that the player needs

1303
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,680
to retire

1304
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,440
so at some point you will have all

1305
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,279
players retiring because everybody's

1306
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,599
above 50 right

1307
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,760
so you can still play with it and i mean

1308
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:33,680
it's a bit buggy algorithm because

1309
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,400
i would expect if i play against a

1310
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,480
people being 50 right and you have

1311
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,839
players being 20 i think they will

1312
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,680
actually do what

1313
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,440
by mention did yesterday to barcelona

1314
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,359
right but the thing is

1315
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,359
sometimes you even lose to people uh

1316
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,680
being 50 and when i had like this

1317
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:52,640
a bug with the 1900 there was actually

1318
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:55,200
people being 120 years 130 years

1319
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,240
beating youngsters right so so maybe

1320
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,439
like this

1321
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:01,040
notion of age if it's not done

1322
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,480
correctly it's still not going to break

1323
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,200
the game but it doesn't give sense to

1324
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,079
have

1325
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,078
players that old

1326
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,839
more questions

1327
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:31,920
you
