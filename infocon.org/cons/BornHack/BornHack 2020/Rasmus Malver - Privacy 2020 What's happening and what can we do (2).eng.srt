1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920

thank you so i'm going to talk to you

5
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,039
about

6
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,440
privacy in general terms i'm going to

7
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,360
talk to you about civil liberties

8
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,400
in general both in what's happening in

9
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
the world and what we're doing in

10
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,560
denmark

11
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,840
and then i'm going to come back and talk

12
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,360
about what we're doing in the

13
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,000
organization against the legal data

14
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
retention

15
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
or for enamel or unlocking where we

16
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,560
filed a lawsuit against

17
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,719
the ministry of justice that we are

18
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,120
keen on winning and changing the world

19
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,960
but let's start at the beginning

20
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
i'm arsene melville if you don't know me

21
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,080
i am

22
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,520
i have a law degree and a former

23
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,960
minister of justice has called me

24
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,520
obsessed

25
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:25,120
so i i wear that as a badge of honor

26
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,599
and he he's i know him from back in the

27
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,560
day

28
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,199
where he was a reasonable guy

29
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
and then he got power and he just felt

30
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,479
the urge to hold the ring and to use it

31
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,880
and that wasn't good for him so so he he

32
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,880
doesn't like me anymore

33
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,440
the world we live in right now we're

34
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,600
seeing human rights violations across

35
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,600
the world we have the uyghurs in asia

36
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,280
i specifically chose not to write china

37
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,280
because well that's the problem is it

38
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,960
china is it not china

39
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,039
black lives matter in america which is

40
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,638
sort of coming out to the world which is

41
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,520
interesting in and of itself

42
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
but also it ties in with something i'm

43
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
going to come back to we have the lgbt

44
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,919
rights in

45
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,080
what we call eastern europe but that's

46
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,758
also a thing here i'll come back to that

47
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,000
palestinians in the middle east that's

48
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,919
an ongoing problem that we have created

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,919
you'll see europe is over represented up

50
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,198
here that's not a coincidence

51
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,000
romani or gypsies as people call them

52
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,919
cincy in europe are having a lot of

53
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,840
difficulties at the moment because

54
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,198
a lot of the sort of what is called far

55
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,239
right but what is

56
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,240
basically racist and nationalist agenda

57
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
they like the gypsies because they're

58
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,720
good scapegoat for everything

59
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
and then we have a ref the refugees in

60
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,080
europe

61
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,638
both between european countries but also

62
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,599
coming

63
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
over the mediterranean to europe where

64
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,360
is now

65
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,159
2020 okay for a politician in the

66
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,319
parliament to say yeah let's shoot them

67
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,120
that's what we are today and that's

68
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,120
that's a problem

69
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,318
minorities suffering is business as

70
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
usual

71
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,000
and that's what we are a lot of

72
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,560
politicians they like to

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,880
grasp onto one of the ones in this list

74
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,000
and say yeah but it's not here

75
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,960
in denmark we just had a massive public

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
protest against

77
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,080
or in favor of the black lives matter

78
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,560
movement in america

79
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,359
and all the racists could say was but

80
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,360
that's not here

81
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,479
three of these are in europe and apart

82
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
from the weakest

83
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,800
most of this is european made it's a

84
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,000
question about taking responsibility for

85
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,919
what we're doing

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,880
that's also why i am a committed man i

87
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,520
am

88
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,199
obsessed with this because we can do

89
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,560
something about most of these things

90
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,680
all we have to do is do it lack of

91
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,919
resistance is futile

92
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,240
and that's you can do something we have

93
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,840
danes fighting for black lives matter

94
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,960
and that's all right but what about here

95
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,679
we have had cases of of racist police

96
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
officers

97
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,919
yet nobody's called a lot of people are

98
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,599
calling for a review of the police

99
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,120
yet the police themselves are saying no

100
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,199
we don't need that

101
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,639
we have a labor minister now we started

102
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,440
out with the legal data retention

103
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,039
organization

104
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,120
against the conservative minister of

105
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,840
justice and they are completely on the

106
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
same page

107
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,119
both in surveillance but also in

108
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,960
minorities rights

109
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
it's all right for him to say nah the

110
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
police are okay

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
yeah okay we have that one case and that

112
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,719
other case and the third case in the

113
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,479
fourth case

114
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
and we have the 10 cases from last week

115
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,719
but there's no need to investigate the

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
danish police

117
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,760
this is the explosive i'm not racist but

118
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,760
but

119
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,399
and i feel we should have that more in

120
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,480
in general life

121
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,839
people saying okay it's not that i'm

122
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,519
racist but

123
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,040
why are we talking about black lives

124
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,000
matter when it's happening across the

125
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,240
world

126
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,040
why are we talking about the weakest

127
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,040
when

128
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,160
it's in china what are we gonna do we're

129
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,360
gonna buy our iphones from china anyway

130
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
and especially the uyghurs are

131
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,240
interesting because they're muslim

132
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
so yeah there is a point to saying we

133
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,080
should do something at home

134
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,959
but the people pointing to this fact

135
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,080
usually aren't doing anything at home

136
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,079
so remember the i'm not racist but but

137
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
because that's sort of i feel like this

138
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,360
is a good way to sort of

139
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,439
leave an argument with these kind of

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,519
people

141
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
lgbt rights in denmark is something i've

142
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,760
fought for myself

143
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,160
and and where i've i've had results and

144
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,080
it's

145
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,240
something that i've been talking about

146
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,640
in the context of surveillance as well

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,360
because this is where it starts in order

148
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,760
to

149
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,360
violate the rights of a minority one

150
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,360
needs to know where the minority is

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,240
this is from uh because i've held this

152
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,079
talk a few times before so i'm gonna

153
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,600
concentrate today on what's happened

154
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,279
since we last saw each other

155
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,240
this is from copenhagen pride and it's

156
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,240
not my best photo

157
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,359
that's a camera mask with several

158
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,120
cameras on it from a policeman

159
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,360
this is a place in copenhagen where the

160
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
police chose to take the copenhagen

161
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,880
pride parade

162
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,959
and narrow where it needed to pass

163
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
through so people couldn't walk on the

164
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,239
other side

165
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,719
of a truck people had to walk after the

166
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,120
truck

167
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,040
so everybody were photographed by this

168
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,560
when we began the legal data retention

169
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,519
the campaign

170
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,599
i said yes but this can be used against

171
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,880
minorities and because i am a member of

172
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,480
the lgbt community

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,200
i often use that so i said by checking

174
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,839
our phones

175
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
they can see if we go to gay bars they

176
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,240
can see who we're close to

177
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,640
how often we are what we know what we do

178
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,320
but

179
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,079
they can certainly get a general gist of

180
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,079
it just from the metadata

181
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,000
and then they just sort of turned it up

182
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,839
and said yeah okay let's do that then

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,760
you don't need to read this this is from

184
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,480
uh rosa listen

185
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,399
something i was made aware of at the ccc

186
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,720
uh last year and it's online

187
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
and you can uh i'm gonna tweet it so go

188
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,519
to artistsmelva.com

189
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,920
oh no twitter.com i'm going to tweet a

190
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,240
link

191
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,640
or you can just google osa listen ccc

192
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
so the weimar republic which we often

193
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
talk about

194
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,079
was the period between the first and the

195
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,079
second world war in germany

196
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,199
and they saw okay fair enough we've lost

197
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,199
this war massively

198
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,279
and we're gonna need some strong leader

199
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,479
to take us out of this

200
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,560
we better begin counting the minorities

201
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,680
so this is a list of known lgbt people

202
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
in germany at the time and people were

203
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,640
saying

204
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,959
don't worry we trust our government

205
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,399
don't worry it's democratically elected

206
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,719
don't worry we have the courts

207
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,680
and then hitler came and they already

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,560
had the list

209
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,920
this is the different ones the political

210
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,119
prisoners the

211
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,319
union workers the immigrants the

212
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,800
this one the purple one that's jehovah's

213
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,800
witnesses

214
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
one shouldn't laugh at the holocaust but

215
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,360
it is still

216
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,800
sort of amusing next to that one are the

217
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,399
lgbt people

218
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,920
and they're all locked as homosexual but

219
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,399
obviously we had trans people in it as

220
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,800
well

221
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,839
anyone who'd ever had any relationship

222
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
then we have

223
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,519
more of this sort of political prisoners

224
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,639
and prisoners from other

225
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:27,519
armies so we saw this police car

226
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,040
preparing to make this list which could

227
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,760
in the future be used

228
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,439
to imprison us so i got a member of

229
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,720
parliament to ask a question

230
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
and this is just there and it's in

231
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,800
danish for you to be able to find it

232
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,200
so this is a absolute reference you can

233
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,160
see that on the stream

234
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,279
this is the reply the police of

235
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,839
copenhagen

236
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,600
have told parliament that we didn't

237
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,680
position any cameras

238
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
but we did have a massive truck with

239
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,040
cameras on it

240
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,240
spying on them and oh by the way i think

241
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,040
you didn't mention

242
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,040
we had a drone

243
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,319
so police were using drones to register

244
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,279
all the participants

245
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,040
in the copenhagen pride parade and this

246
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,000
is a good case because even if you

247
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,719
are even if you aren't an lgbt person

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,959
this is

249
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,120
they're a good canary in the coal mine

250
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,920
and we've gotten a lot of rice recently

251
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
we can see we condemn poland for being

252
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,719
anti-lgbt

253
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
but we're living in a country where we

254
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,320
register the people who participate in

255
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,000
the march

256
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,920
and the reason this is important is also

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,240
because the march is to be out there to

258
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
see

259
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,639
us and it's for a lot of people the only

260
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,399
time of year when they can come away

261
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,560
from the tiny village to a place where

262
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,519
they're accepted

263
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,160
but now they know the police are taping

264
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,720
it

265
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,000
and keeping it are they going to come

266
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,040
there again

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,279
that's a problem so both before

268
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,719
during and after they're doing this it's

269
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,839
a problem

270
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,240
another case we have is

271
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,600
the drones in themselves are illegal for

272
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
the police to use

273
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
and we talked about this on a radio show

274
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,040
as part of

275
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,680
problem is the law states police cannot

276
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,639
film anything that isn't readily

277
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,319
accessible from

278
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,040
street level thus they cannot use drones

279
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,800
they knew this they told parliament this

280
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,439
then they made a law saying

281
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,359
police are allowed to fly in city areas

282
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,720
and for some people or for everybody

283
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,320
who's not a lawyer

284
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,320
that sounds like now they've been

285
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,199
allowed to fly the drones and take

286
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
photos

287
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,639
but they haven't they're now allowed to

288
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,839
fly this was all in

289
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,440
air traffic regulation the air traffic

290
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,760
regulation in denmark now is if you want

291
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
to

292
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,439
fly in a city you need to if i have a

293
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,560
permit first but you still can't

294
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
photograph

295
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,638
into people's homes and and things you

296
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,720
can't see from street level

297
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,959
so the law they needed to change was the

298
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,600
one saying the police are never allowed

299
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,279
to film anything they can't readily see

300
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
but they didn't change that law because

301
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,120
they knew that would be

302
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,240
an admission of a violation of human

303
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,760
rights

304
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,920
so they changed the other one so it

305
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,399
seems like it and that's why we need

306
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,079
people like me

307
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,240
people with a law degree who are sort of

308
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,638
ready to take some of these cases

309
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,399
because when they did it i brought up

310
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,920
the lgbt community and said okay so

311
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,440
you're going to be able to photograph

312
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
where we are and who we are in the

313
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
parade

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,880
and two years later they did just that

315
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,119
and they admitted it

316
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,720
this is open information they said yes

317
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,720
we did that and we use the drone

318
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,680
there are reasons to be worried this one

319
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,279
is a screenshot of a danish newspaper

320
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,199
you don't need to know what it says

321
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,800
this is the response when a political

322
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,839
party said why don't we put

323
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,839
body cams on all police officers

324
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,199
and the chairman of the police union

325
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,759
said oh

326
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,599
might as well just abolish the police

327
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,399
you don't believe us

328
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,600
we're no use to you at all i brought

329
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,519
this here because it's interesting

330
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,399
because now we have on one side

331
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,240
the police illegally admitting or

332
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,880
legally admitting to illegally

333
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,360
surveilled the public that's no problem

334
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,839
yeah

335
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,040
we're stopping pedophiles and also and

336
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,480
on the other hand

337
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,839
our access to that information is not

338
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
available

339
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,560
i can't go to the police and say can i

340
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,639
see the photos you took of me at pride

341
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,399
they don't have to and when we want them

342
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,320
to document what they're doing

343
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,000
especially to minorities

344
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,199
they don't want to and and the fact that

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
we're living in this without doing

346
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,839
anything about it

347
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,079
is why i am that is why we need the

348
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:39,519
activism

349
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,279
so what can we do there are two tracks

350
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,279
that's political and illegal

351
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,199
the political is soft power but it's

352
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,920
it's and it's very easy to sell to

353
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,079
people

354
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,920
like wear a badge i have a lot of

355
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,000
stickers that i make for my own money

356
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,040
which are interesting so so wear the

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,800
stickers raise awareness ask questions

358
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,680
of people in power

359
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,120
tweet at the police share what you see

360
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,240
them do

361
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,240
and recruit others to do the same

362
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,120
this works uh the day before yesterday

363
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,160
we went to uh to pick up a fridge in

364
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,760
owens

365
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,280
for the csv village and on our way we

366
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,319
passed the instant spoofus

367
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,918
which is perhaps it's

368
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,918
there's no nice way to describe them

369
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,400
it's it's a chain of restaurants in the

370
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,880
same way the mcdonald's is a

371
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,679
restaurant where they do mass-produce

372
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,039
not very

373
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,360
well prepared meals

374
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,039
but outside there was a protest and i

375
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,039
really enjoyed that there was a protest

376
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,840
of young people protesting turpo

377
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,840
chickens

378
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,520
and i've never heard of a turbo chicken

379
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,120
so i had to sort of google it and the

380
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,799
guy i was driving with had to say

381
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,479
yeah that's because what you do is you

382
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,559
treat them these

383
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
growth hormones and they can become a

384
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,639
fully pledged

385
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,280
chicken flesh chicken after only a few

386
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,960
months

387
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,240
but they don't have any bones so you

388
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,679
sort sorry just keep them there so it's

389
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,320
a way of growing the chicken meat

390
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,320
artificially

391
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,240
so now i know i don't like that

392
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,760
and that was just young people and this

393
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,280
might have been a project for them

394
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,760
because they were standing like outside

395
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,440
of owens which in itself is a small town

396
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,679
but but they're standing on one of the

397
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,320
sort of roads quite far from the center

398
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,880
of town

399
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,879
with banners that's fucking brilliant

400
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,639
it changed my mind from a position i

401
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,640
didn't know i had

402
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,360
but it's probably not gonna ban the use

403
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,960
of the chickens

404
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,799
and that's why we have the legal track

405
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,559
which i'm sort of promoting

406
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,160
which is hard power because what we're

407
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,960
doing with the legal data retention is

408
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,080
we're using

409
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,440
eu legislation the european

410
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,799
charter on fundamental rights to defeat

411
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,799
the danish politicians

412
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,240
and that's hard power we're stopping

413
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,760
them at court

414
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,919
and that's quite impressive but it's

415
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,280
also very difficult to tell people with

416
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,360
a straight face and

417
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,440
without people saying oh wow that's

418
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,320
difficult and i trust the authorities

419
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
all of that

420
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,039
so what we do is we educate we fundraise

421
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,640
and we facilitate

422
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,559
and i mainly took facilitate because i

423
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,880
wanted three words but

424
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,080
it's we educate the public like i'm

425
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,840
doing now hopefully

426
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,840
is telling you people why this is

427
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,320
important and how we can do it

428
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,360
we go out there and we raise money and

429
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,039
we facilitate

430
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,959
for you guys to be able to do your own

431
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,720
processes

432
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,120
one of my which is not related to the

433
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,440
organization against data retention

434
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,840
stickers is of uh it's like a warning

435
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,640
sticker that's

436
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,439
semi-transparent so it's meant to be

437
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,760
placed in a

438
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,440
car window and it's a police officer

439
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,120
beating someone sitting down in front of

440
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,280
them

441
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,120
and i do these stickers whenever sticker

442
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,799
mule has an offer on they have an offer

443
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,439
every week and the offer was transparent

444
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,720
stickers

445
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:56,240
and i thought this would be interesting

446
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,240
to place in a police car window

447
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,080
and a few days later video emerged

448
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,399
on the social media and it ended up in

449
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,280
danish media of police officers

450
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,000
in denmark feeding people sitting down

451
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,918
not doing

452
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,200
anything illegal so that was kind of a

453
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,799
spot on

454
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,120
but this is what i mean when i say

455
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,600
facilitate activism

456
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,719
this is for you guys to take and try and

457
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,120
sneak onto a police car

458
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,440
i'm not encouraging you to well i don't

459
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,360
want to be responsible

460
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,520
i am encouraging you to do it please do

461
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,199
it but i'm not responsible for for you

462
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,200
being beaten up by the police afterwards

463
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,960
and that's basically what we're doing

464
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,640
please ask the questions of

465
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,480
us so you can answer them and other

466
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,400
people are asking you because you're

467
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,600
going to be ambassadors to this

468
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,440
you're going to go out there and say

469
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,840
we're doing this we're changing the

470
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
world

471
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,520
a bit of a shift the american civil

472
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,120
liberties union is the aclu and that's

473
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,080
what got me into all of this

474
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,760
i knew i liked or i loved the human

475
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,559
rights and the fundamental

476
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,158
principles of the rights of men and i

477
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,600
knew that in america they had this

478
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,679
tradition

479
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,639
for having an organization that can

480
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
enter into

481
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,760
and and do uh amicus briefs as they're

482
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,039
called

483
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,960
where in an american court of law anyone

484
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,559
can enter any case

485
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,080
so i can enter on the side of for

486
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,120
instance the government and say oh you

487
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,439
need to do this

488
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,439
or i can enter on the side of the victim

489
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,480
and saying for these reasons we should

490
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,600
go this way

491
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,600
in denmark this has been prohibited

492
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,959
and they've done all they could to to

493
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,879
discourage

494
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
us from taking these suits i've talked

495
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,799
about that earlier so today i'm just

496
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,799
going to focus on the aclu

497
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,039
because they are the reason that

498
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,760
american women can have an abortion

499
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,760
they are part of ending slavery they are

500
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,840
the reason lgbt people have

501
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,600
rights they are fighting for the

502
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,678
migrants rights which is interesting

503
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,879
because america was founded by migrants

504
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,679
coming there taking the

505
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,200
place from somewhere else and now trying

506
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,120
to keep other people out

507
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,880
it's marvelous but also the right to

508
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,000
vote which in america is not just the

509
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,360
females but also the black people

510
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,960
and as in denmark people with any kind

511
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,799
of psychiatric disorder

512
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,200
and in america and this brilliant thing

513
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,280
they take the right to vote away from

514
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,240
people they deem to be criminals

515
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,760
which is the best way ever to to to keep

516
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,760
your opponents out of

517
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,480
of the political debate all you have to

518
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,000
do is criminalize what they're doing

519
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,360
and that's what they've done in america

520
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,760
with the whole three strikes and you're

521
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,520
out

522
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,120
but only for certain offenses that most

523
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,600
black people commit that's a different

524
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,158
story

525
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
the hlu i want you to know about them

526
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,559
that just

527
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,799
this is a documentary that just came out

528
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,760
about four cases in the aclu

529
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,879
that they're currently fighting as a

530
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,559
documentary that

531
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,480
we don't have the right to show it here

532
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
but i would i wouldn't mind pointing

533
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,880
anyone in the direction of where to get

534
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,960
it anyway

535
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,640
and i'm working on in september having a

536
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,000
screening of it in copenhagen

537
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,000
and i can really recommend it this is

538
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,240
what i need

539
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320
this is the american supreme court with

540
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,799
people protesting while the aclu is

541
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,559
inside arguing

542
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,840
that's the difficult part about doing

543
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,480
the legal track

544
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,000
in this activism i need to convince the

545
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,120
media to talk about it

546
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
and that's fucking difficult last year

547
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,000
there was an award

548
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,679
ceremony for the people who had fought

549
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,880
most for the

550
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:37,840
human rights in denmark

551
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,840
and not that i'm bitter but

552
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,000
two of the people nominated are

553
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,600
journalists who've only ever written

554
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,919
about it whenever i've been pushing them

555
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,879
to do it and for every 10 times i've

556
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,480
tried i write about it once

557
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,720
so i need this i need you all to go out

558
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,559
and protest when we have this when we

559
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,200
have these meetings when we have these

560
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,520
calls

561
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,960
when we have this it doesn't need to be

562
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,360
inside this building

563
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
like when we when we sued the government

564
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,120
we did file

565
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,799
a lawsuit but we do that online instead

566
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,840
we went to the court

567
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,760
just with a pretend subpoena

568
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,439
and we filed it pretend because they

569
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,200
don't accept physical post

570
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,640
but that was sort of for the media to

571
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,279
understand it this one is lgbt rights

572
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,960
this one

573
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,159
is abortion and this one was the muslim

574
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,640
ban the trump one

575
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,640
so they're there at the minute in more

576
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,960
than 100 lawsuits against the trump

577
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,960
administration and local administrations

578
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,039
fighting for these things now

579
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,720
i'm going to start off a danish version

580
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,480
of this

581
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,400
and this is going to be interesting

582
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,400
because i'm in the process

583
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,159
of getting a lot of money to do it so

584
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,480
this is further closer to

585
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,760
to to to being a thing than it's ever

586
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,760
been before

587
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,200
so if you want to join me and help me

588
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
you don't have to be lawyers

589
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,720
i i need activists i need creative

590
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,399
people i need

591
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,080
people who want to do a bit of the admin

592
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,200
so i'm not the only one holding all of

593
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,600
this up

594
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,360
please do get in touch and get some of

595
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,439
the stickers

596
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,479
illegal data retention which is why i'm

597
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,679
mainly here

598
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,159
is where we are at the minute

599
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,520
we are very close to uh to finishing it

600
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,080
which is nice

601
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,760
i'm gonna focus again on what's happened

602
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,600
since last we saw each other

603
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,039
the danish telcos are legally retaining

604
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,360
customers data you know that

605
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,200
now we know that 72 percent of the

606
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,360
danish parliament is in favor

607
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,120
of any surveillance regardless of

608
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,279
whether it works

609
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,360
and that's because i have pushed some of

610
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:40,080
the members of parliament on our side

611
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,639
to force parliament to have hearings on

612
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,360
this

613
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
where all members or all parties have to

614
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,158
come

615
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,159
and defend their position and they're

616
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,600
quite happy to go up there and say yeah

617
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,679
we just want surveillance just for the

618
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,080
course of it

619
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,360
um and we also have the the weird

620
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,279
situation where

621
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,520
this was because in the tilito watson

622
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,760
case uh which was uh where the judgment

623
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,158
was handed down in 2016

624
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,520
uh in the beginning of 2017 danish

625
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,039
government said yeah

626
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,879
we're not allowed to keep doing this

627
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,879
they've obviously told us now

628
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,000
but we found this art case from the

629
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,440
danish high court

630
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,080
saying oh but you you might be able to

631
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,679
uphold

632
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,000
the situation for up to 12 months

633
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,279
that was in itself wrong but that was

634
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
their only argument was

635
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,760
we have 12 months to fix it and that was

636
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,320
in 2017.

637
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:34,000
i'm unsure if 12 months have passed

638
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,000
since but people tell me they have

639
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,320
since we were last here one year ago

640
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,200
scandals one to four

641
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,480
we had a massive uh scandal that you're

642
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,159
all gonna love and i

643
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,679
it's difficult for me to explain it to

644
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,400
people who don't do programming or

645
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,480
scripting

646
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,400
but what they've done is all of this

647
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,919
illegal data when they get it in

648
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,840
it might not show what they want this

649
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,840
show so they went out

650
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,039
to a private company and said please

651
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,120
build us close

652
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,039
software that's gonna transform this

653
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,000
data that we don't understand

654
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:05,520
into something that supports our case

655
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:20,399
closed

656
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:22,399
not available

657
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,600
and now the people in re responsible for

658
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,559
this the technicians

659
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,760
sitting there were like okay but uh it's

660
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,678
very important that we get this

661
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,520
information out quickly

662
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,279
and the reason that's important is not

663
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,120
because it's important cases

664
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,360
it's because the only way to get the

665
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,479
data without a court order was to say

666
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,479
they needed to do it quickly

667
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,480
so instead of sitting there waiting for

668
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,080
the the closed source software to finish

669
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,399
processing in ways they didn't

670
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,199
understand and then send it to the

671
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,600
people

672
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,320
they built a script like a bash script

673
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,879
saying

674
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,879
after 15 minutes send whatever is done

675
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,440
so there might have been exculpatory

676
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,039
evidence that was just rendered after

677
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,799
the 15 minutes

678
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,879
but that wasn't sent so the court never

679
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,120
got in

680
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,000
it's true this is real life it's like a

681
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,600
stand-up show

682
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,559
but how can you how can anyone i went

683
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,840
to like i i i went as a journalist both

684
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,960
to the press conference where the

685
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,360
minister sort of

686
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,240
disconverted like he he vindicated

687
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,039
everyone in his

688
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,559
ministry despite what we now knew they

689
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,080
knew about this and didn't do

690
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,678
anything about it they knew about it

691
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,120
during the election and chose to keep it

692
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,720
a secret

693
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,479
and he said ah nobody's done anything

694
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,399
wrong and then i went from there to the

695
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,640
police own briefing

696
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,399
with the technicians and they're like

697
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,159
yeah we

698
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,678
so there's this magic thing called

699
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,159
scripts

700
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,520
and it says how could you people and

701
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,880
they're like no we don't believe we've

702
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,080
done anything wrong because it's very

703
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,039
important whenever you have a child

704
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,559
molester

705
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,240
okay but have you ever had a child

706
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,879
molester where we needed the location

707
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,240
data

708
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,200
no no but if we had yeah so that wasn't

709
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,200
good

710
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,720
and we've had three more since then

711
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
where it turns out the telcos are not

712
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,080
just

713
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,760
logging uh where you are or the metadata

714
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,320
they're also logging the content of your

715
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,399
unencrypted texts

716
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,639
and that's interesting because telco in

717
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,760
this case was taylor norm which is

718
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,039
around the world

719
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,480
which where i used to work and whom i

720
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,640
got in touch with

721
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,679
after we filed the lawsuit and we went

722
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,000
to a meeting

723
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,360
with their leading general counsel like

724
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,919
the the the the

725
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,678
i don't know cto of of law stuff cielo

726
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,679
and she looked us in the eyes and said

727
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,240
don't worry we're not logging the

728
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,440
content of anything

729
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,000
and now we know they do and they did

730
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,000
and they knew

731
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,360
so so that's sort of difficult to say

732
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,080
that without people saying okay

733
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,000
you seem like a bit of a nutter but i

734
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,158
can document all of this with like

735
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,080
written that this is how

736
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,679
is this happening with with so little

737
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,240
attention

738
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,279
uh those were the scandals and would use

739
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,159
these in court as well

740
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,559
to stop it from from being delayed more

741
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:16,880
we've also received the opinion of the

742
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,000
advocate general at the european union

743
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,000
court of justice

744
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,360
with the beautiful justice eu acronym

745
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,080
now when you have a case at the european

746
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,559
court

747
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,158
it's usually the the courts of the with

748
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,000
the question in the country

749
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,200
in this case it's it's a french court

750
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,200
and a belgian court

751
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,880
who have sent cases to the european

752
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,600
union's court of justice

753
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,039
to ask them how should we interpret the

754
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
law of the european union

755
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,600
in this regard but as i said before a

756
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,039
lot of people can join filing amicus

757
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,039
briefs and the danish government did

758
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,960
that and many others have done that

759
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,360
and once they have all that they hold

760
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,760
the hearings and then you get an opinion

761
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,879
from the advocate general who is not a

762
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,600
part of the court

763
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,279
as such he's not a judge in himself but

764
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,760
he comes up with

765
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,519
like an overview and for these reasons i

766
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,519
feel like we should go in this direction

767
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,559
but obviously it's up to the courts

768
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,320
and it's brilliant it's all on our side

769
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,320
and he's i'm gonna come back to it

770
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,158
because there's some juicy bits in there

771
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:21,360
um but even then the danish police

772
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:24,399
have a spokesperson

773
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,479
who is struggling with the truth

774
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:28,158
um so he's already out there saying oh

775
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,360
yeah yeah when they say that we're not

776
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,360
allowed to do that

777
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,279
what they mean is that we've done that

778
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,719
uh slightly wrong we should do

779
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,559
more of it that kind of argument and

780
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,320
and on the basis of this the danish

781
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,918
court have given us a court date this

782
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,918
monday so next monday

783
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,480
is going to be what's uh preparatory

784
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,039
court meeting is on the phone and

785
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,000
we're gonna set a date for the general

786
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,440
hearing

787
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,120
and that's very important and that's

788
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,399
very interesting and it's probably gonna

789
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,639
be in january

790
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,158
and what comes with this date is also a

791
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,799
date of uh

792
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,120
when you end the preparatory work so

793
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,760
it's gonna be sometime november december

794
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,678
from then the government cannot add any

795
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,879
arguments they cannot they cannot change

796
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,559
their opinion

797
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,559
they're gonna be locked into this and

798
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,840
then in january we're gonna be there and

799
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,840
we're gonna beat them

800
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,880
and obviously i need you guys but we're

801
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,039
going to come back to that this is from

802
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,760
the opinion of the advocate general

803
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,039
he says we told you this and we told you

804
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,360
this again

805
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,080
to stop asking us the same fucking

806
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,479
question

807
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,199
he uses more legalese language but i'm

808
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,200
translating it

809
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,120
he also says obviously the court should

810
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,279
uphold but we've already decided it

811
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,039
would be silly to do anything else

812
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,880
and then in in he says so regardless of

813
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,960
the fear of crime you cannot justify

814
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,720
surveilling everyone all of the time

815
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,720
and that's the one you come back to when

816
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,519
they're saying oh yes but what if a

817
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,320
terrorist

818
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,080
held your wife at gunpoint and the only

819
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,879
way to figure out who they are

820
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,559
is to go back and see where they've been

821
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,519
and he's just saying stop it there's

822
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,639
nothing that's that

823
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,279
bad that it can rectify or justify us

824
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,600
doing this

825
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,600
all of the time and this is interesting

826
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,399
yes um because one of the arguments

827
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,399
that the courts have said is okay but

828
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,600
imagine this

829
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,279
pedophiles so

830
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,519
we have in the european charter

831
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,240
of civil liberties children have the

832
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,440
right not to be violated

833
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,600
and in order for us to to uphold

834
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,120
the right not to be violated we need to

835
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,480
surveil all of the people

836
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,399
all of the time and he just says

837
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,240
well no no no no no stop this

838
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,158
and and this is interesting because this

839
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,320
isn't very far from what he says

840
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,279
it is just yes obviously pure philly is

841
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,600
bad

842
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,559
but two things you can do things about

843
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,439
it without

844
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,000
everyone and when we have this conflict

845
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,120
of

846
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,919
rights like i have the right to

847
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,760
freedom of expression but if i say that

848
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,320
all muslims rape their children

849
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,839
that would be racist and it would also

850
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,200
violate the rights of those people i

851
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,960
would say that about

852
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,560
people have a hard time understanding

853
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,199
this but this is a clear-cut

854
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,199
violation or a conflict of rights

855
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:26,000
and even though pedophilia is very bad

856
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,599
you cannot say that the right of a few

857
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,879
of children not to be violated

858
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,280
can be protected by surveillance and

859
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,440
not to a degree where this is

860
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,440
proportionate with what you're doing

861
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,000
we could also lock up all men because

862
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,839
it's usually men

863
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,280
and and then well yeah i keep the

864
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,159
children i don't know like

865
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,079
feeding parts but that would violate

866
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,679
other rights so we shouldn't do that

867
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,320
that's a bad idea

868
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,720
and and this is interesting because this

869
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,400
is such a silly argument

870
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,759
that it's difficult for the danish

871
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,200
government to come up with

872
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,720
anything to spin this any other way

873
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,200
and i'm really looking forward to seeing

874
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,200
them try

875
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,800
another argument that they've come up

876
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,480
with is oh yes

877
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,839
we know the court has told us not to do

878
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,839
this but they haven't told us what to do

879
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
instead

880
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,839
and i've been sort of i've been on

881
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,200
television and on the radio

882
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,160
trying to say but that's not the core

883
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,680
problem you're violating

884
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,279
people's rights it's not up to the

885
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,160
course to tell you how to get away with

886
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,839
it

887
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,000
like i usually say okay so there's a

888
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,320
bank robber standing before a judge

889
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,440
saying yeah but how else am i gonna earn

890
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,359
money

891
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,640
no one's gonna say oh well yeah that is

892
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,880
a good question

893
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,799
really we need to vacate the premises

894
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,480
and not really give him any sentencing

895
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,200
because we're not able to tell him how

896
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,839
to make money

897
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,598
off of his very limited skill set he has

898
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,440
been caught

899
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,960
so so i i came up with this it's not up

900
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,400
to the court to write new legislation

901
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,000
montesquieu who came up with the whole

902
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,680
division of powers is spinning so

903
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,760
hard in his grave that the french

904
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,598
government because he's buried in paris

905
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,520
is considering using the cemetery as a

906
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,280
thermal power plant

907
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,960
because it's really now we're we're

908
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,320
looking at him spinning at more than the

909
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,000
speed of sound

910
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:17,200
um this is how how can the legislator

911
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,200
and the the the

912
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,800
executive branch of government say oh

913
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,320
yeah

914
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,839
so you're telling us what we're doing is

915
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,880
wrong well why don't you try to make the

916
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,078
legislation

917
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,359
it's it's such a a useless argument and

918
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,200
this is what they have left

919
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,400
so so that's why i'm so optimistic that

920
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,359
when we get this

921
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,200
opinion of the court there's nothing

922
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,078
really that they can surprise us with

923
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,000
because

924
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,839
all of this has been done another reason

925
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,720
i'm positive is because of the mark

926
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,000
schrems

927
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,480
case against facebook where the advocate

928
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,040
general

929
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,560
had actually given them some ways out

930
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,960
where they could sort of

931
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,480
tweak it a bit and say okay but facebook

932
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,160
can do these things and maybe the

933
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,520
american government is allowed to see

934
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,680
these things

935
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,200
and the court said okay we read the

936
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,520
opinion of the advocate

937
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,839
but no we're not going to take any of

938
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,720
the consensus pieces

939
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,880
european union citizens rights and

940
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,560
people in the territories are

941
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,320
so much higher than whatever you're

942
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,880
getting from facebook surveilling

943
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,320
everyone so i'm looking forward to

944
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
seeing the opinion from the court in

945
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,480
this one

946
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,400
where the advocate general hasn't given

947
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,880
them any ways out it's going to be

948
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,880
brutal

949
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,640
so coming up i need a happening

950
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,720
when the decision comes because it's

951
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,000
going to be published on the internet

952
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,520
like now it's there i need people in a

953
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,800
room with flags and

954
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,000
and banners shouting yay

955
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,000
regardless of what it says

956
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,800
because that's what journalists want to

957
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,279
cover they need people being happy or

958
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,560
sad

959
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,640
uh on camera and and i need your people

960
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,560
uh to help me do that we're probably

961
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,000
gonna do it in copenhagen but

962
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,680
maybe we'll do it with some people uh as

963
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,920
i was about to say zooming in but

964
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,560
obviously assume is evil so

965
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,359
joining us on on a more respectable

966
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,520
platform

967
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,520
that isn't microsoft teams um

968
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,440
imagine that come and join us on

969
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,839
microsoft teams

970
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,000
that's when you okay so if you ever see

971
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,759
a photo of me being sort of held captive

972
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,400
in in like an uh a cave in albania or

973
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,119
somewhere

974
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,040
that'll be my code word to you guys

975
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,920
would be used microsoft teams to contact

976
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,320
them

977
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,079
then you know me it's me so the danish

978
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,359
court hearing that's in january we're

979
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,960
going to need an audience

980
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,319
so we need to fill up the courtroom

981
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,119
seats and we need people standing

982
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,200
outside

983
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,640
they're not going to deliver the verdict

984
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,439
on the same day because we don't do that

985
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,200
in denmark

986
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,440
which is probably good because they need

987
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,520
some time to write it down

988
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,680
but it's still gonna need people sitting

989
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,920
in there for two reasons one of them

990
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,160
for the press but mostly for the judges

991
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,160
because

992
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,078
that's what i can't prove i would like

993
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,720
to do it and that

994
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,520
is a suggestion i've made to do some

995
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,319
research about

996
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,640
but do the rulings more often go in

997
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,000
in the direction of the citizen when the

998
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,440
courtroom is full

999
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,359
versus when it's just the citizen and

1000
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,440
their lawyer there i don't know

1001
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,759
but i like to put a bit of pressure on

1002
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,280
the on the judges and say hey look

1003
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,599
this is something that people are

1004
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,560
interested in and then when the decision

1005
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,480
comes we need a party

1006
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,440
again same reason as the others but also

1007
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,440
because we deserve it

1008
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,078
for the danish aclu i need help

1009
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,079
um i did write that first the phrasing i

1010
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,680

1011
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,880
me trying to to seek

1012
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,919
mental health but um

1013
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,839
no i uh to to set up a danish version of

1014
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,240

1015
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,078
i need people to help me with all the

1016
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,560
administrative stuff with the political

1017
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,400
stuff with the communication stuff with

1018
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,480
just all the boring stuff and some of

1019
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,200
the interesting stuff

1020
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,640
and and you're very welcome was that a

1021
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,160
question

1022
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,520
i do need a better name and that's

1023
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,720
that's a thing it's not going to be

1024
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,000
called the danish

1025
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,520
aslu in the movie they fight

1026
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
when they're standing outside they're

1027
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,040
shouting aclu

1028
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,040
we are here we stand with you and i want

1029
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,119
i want our name to be something that can

1030
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,079
be worked into a chant

1031
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,359
that's sort of that's my my spec uh for

1032
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,599
for what i need help with

1033
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,240
is finding a name for this organization

1034
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,160
that can be gendered

1035
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,359
ongoing violations and the reason we

1036
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,359
need the broader

1037
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:47,359
thing the drones are already talked

1038
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,520
about this is an area where they've

1039
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:50,400
admitted to parliament what we're doing

1040
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,079
is illegal

1041
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,720
but snooping at borders this is an area

1042
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,960
where

1043
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,319
during the corona so we weren't allowing

1044
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,720
people in unless they had

1045
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,560
a a reasonable reason to get into the

1046
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,640
country and one of those could be

1047
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,920
again with eu legislation and civil

1048
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,680
liberties

1049
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,200
that you had a boyfriend or girlfriend

1050
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,000
or whatever type of partner in the

1051
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,078
country

1052
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,319
and the police said okay fair enough

1053
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,359
we'll need to check your emails and text

1054
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:19,040
messages to see

1055
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,279
if you're actually in a relationship

1056
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,680
and i said excuse me you can't do that

1057
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,480
that that is a violation of of human

1058
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,759
rights because

1059
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,720
it it it would always be something that

1060
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,640
is protected

1061
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,399
by human rights even in the danish

1062
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,560
constitution which doesn't have many

1063
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,520
that this is a private conversation they

1064
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,119
want access to

1065
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,040
in order to get that they need

1066
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,079
legislation that is clear

1067
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,560
and that is there at the time and that

1068
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,400
is

1069
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,160
reasonable so again we're talking about

1070
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,359
the conflict of rights

1071
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,520
and it needs to be balanced and they had

1072
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,799
none of those things so i got parliament

1073
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,359
to ask a question

1074
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,640
and the police said yeah we did instruct

1075
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,799
the police to do it

1076
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,078
we wrote these cards because apparently

1077
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,160
that's how they communicate with their

1078
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,960
officers they write these action cards

1079
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,078
they're called

1080
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,359
sounds like magic with gathering and

1081
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,920
and the police can pull them out and say

1082
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,680
okay i need to snoop in this

1083
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,839
and yeah that's illegal we did those

1084
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,040
that was illegal sorry about that

1085
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,400
they didn't even say sorry about that

1086
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,599
they just said yeah we did something

1087
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,599
illegal we've stopped that now

1088
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,440
that's it that how can that be how is no

1089
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,839
one being put

1090
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,520
like how is no one being being being

1091
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,560
held responsible for doing it they've

1092
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,759
said what we did

1093
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,640
we had a computer we wrote a text it was

1094
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,400
illegal

1095
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,319
they did the thing we wrote that was

1096
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,680
illegal and it was illegal

1097
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:43,279
oh yeah fair enough you just mischief

1098
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,240
photographing that's general both at the

1099
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,400
pride parade but also at other protests

1100
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,839
and then it's something i i thought with

1101
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,520
myself

1102
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:53,440
i live in nepal which is a part of

1103
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,440
copenhagen where the police are ever

1104
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,000
present because it's so politically

1105
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,760
an interesting area and the police are

1106
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,720
taking photos of people they meet in the

1107
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,119
street

1108
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,160
and that is illegal and and it's been

1109
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
illegal since the

1110
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,240
end of the 1980s and they haven't made

1111
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,960
any new legislation

1112
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,640
and we know it's illegal but again i can

1113
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,520
only go to court if they've taken a

1114
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,040
photo of me

1115
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,119
or if i have someone they've taken a

1116
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,079
photo of so i'm out in the streets

1117
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,200
sort of trying to recruit people to to

1118
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,119
do this

1119
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,560
and it would be interesting here or

1120
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,560
better here to have an

1121
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,920
organization like the aclu that could

1122
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,279
bring this to court

1123
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,440
cctv same model they are allowing

1124
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,720
not in legislation but but in sort of

1125
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,520
bylaws

1126
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,000
the police to both take over control

1127
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,000
with

1128
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,200
existing cctv cameras but more

1129
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,240
importantly and we talked about this

1130
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,279
before

1131
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,560
existing illegal cameras can be made

1132
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,760
legal by the police

1133
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,839
taking them assuming control

1134
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,280
so if you have a place where you want a

1135
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,880
camera but it's illegal for the police

1136
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,960
to put one there

1137
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,800
they can in secret tell a citizen to put

1138
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,480
in a legal camera and by them taking

1139
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,079
control of it it is now legal

1140
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,079
that's a problem and then we have the

1141
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,599
ghetto legislation which is where

1142
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,920
we are beginning to see direct

1143
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,800
nazi quotes so now it's like oh this

1144
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,520
area

1145
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,680
is uh populated by people from a

1146
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,280
different country or from a different

1147
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,279
skin color than us and

1148
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,800
we are defining it as being a place

1149
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,839
where people aren't making a lot of

1150
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,560
money

1151
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,560
and because of that we need to evict the

1152
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,160
residents

1153
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,480
and it's sort of it's a self-fulfilling

1154
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,000
equation this one you're saying it's for

1155
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,839
people who don't make money

1156
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,440
and then they're using that as the

1157
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,839
evidence but these people aren't making

1158
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,200
money

1159
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,119
in this ghetto because they're living in

1160
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,480
the ghetto but the ghetto is defined as

1161
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,160
them not making money

1162
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,680
i'm sorry that went a bit confusing but

1163
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,598
i hope you get it

1164
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,078
you define these people don't make

1165
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,800
enough money thus we call them a ghetto

1166
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,839
and then you say they are ghetto because

1167
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,119
they're not making money

1168
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,200
and the reason they're not making money

1169
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,520
is because they are in the ghetto

1170
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,118
so it's it's just silly and that's

1171
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,440
another one that would be obvious to

1172
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,440
take to the courts

1173
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,520

and then we all together gonna do a

1183
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,119
fictitious campaign to do something

1184
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,720
about it

1185
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,480
including fundraising and that sort of

1186
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,680
thing cool

1187
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,839
that's all for me do you have any

1188
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:47,839
questions

1189
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:47,839
richard yeah

1190
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,599
if the police said oh but we're only

1191
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,480
watching for people attacking the gay

1192
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,240
pride parade

1193
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,520
and that is generally what they said

1194
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,279
they were looking for

1195
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,040
except all the cameras were pointing at

1196
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,359
or pointed at the parade

1197
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,960
and the problem here is they're keeping

1198
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:17,279
the data

1199
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,119
after they're not having been an attack

1200
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,040
they are keeping the footage

1201
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,400
and facial recognition which i also have

1202
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,119
on on this one with the ongoing

1203
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,359
violations

1204
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,560
is illegal for the police to use but we

1205
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,000
know from a leak

1206
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,160
that they have bought some of this

1207
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,160
software and we know from the

1208
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,200
official spokesperson that they're using

1209
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,680
it on

1210
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,399
videos we already have and one of those

1211
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,200
videos

1212
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,599
is the whole pricing is a video they

1213
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,520
have

1214
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,359
so now we're looking for them to add to

1215
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,000
to to answer have you used it on this

1216
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,839
specific

1217
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,359
specific thing and we're also back to

1218
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,720
the thing about the body cams they don't

1219
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:57,839
want to show us what they have

1220
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:57,839
so we don't know any more questions yes

1221
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,839
yes

1222
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,920
i've really tried so the question is

1223
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,960
more of a

1224
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,800
statement is the eu is often being

1225
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,520
ridiculed for some of the

1226
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,240
edge cases in denmark its cucumbers in

1227
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,240
in the uk was bananas

1228
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:48,078
where they've just harmonized tracy

1229
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,839
trading saying instead of selling

1230
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,280
cucumbers by the case you need to sell

1231
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,720
them by weight

1232
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,160
because once you had the and the

1233
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,919
cucumber one isn't something danes

1234
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,040
brought in even

1235
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,920
so bringing the eu perspective as our

1236
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,240
defense against ourselves is interesting

1237
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,720
and

1238
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,200
the thing i can can attach to that is we

1239
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,040
are using it against our politicians

1240
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,480
and that's what's brilliant so we are

1241
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,319
not using it against ourselves we're

1242
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,040
using against politicians who have run

1243
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,558
away

1244
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,160
and it's interesting because in the

1245
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,880
danish constitution we don't have a lot

1246
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,960
of

1247
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,480
rights but after the war when we knew

1248
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,280
the eu were coming

1249
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,319
we did make a clause is a close 20 of

1250
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,559
the danish constitution

1251
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,520
that we can move some of the powers from

1252
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:30,880
the constitution

1253
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,359
to uh super

1254
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,720
national no supernational organizations

1255
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,558
such as the eu

1256
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,319
and we've done that and by doing that

1257
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,720
the eu has jurisdiction

1258
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:42,720
in denmark and after the lisbon treaty

1259
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,240
we got the charter with human rights

1260
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,680
which unlike the convention on human

1261
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,319
rights can be used

1262
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,598
directly against the governments and

1263
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,359
that's interesting and they

1264
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,839
if we don't honor it they can begin

1265
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,480
making uh financial cuts towards us

1266
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,839
so they have the power and we're using

1267
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,400
that and that is something i am trying

1268
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,480
to to

1269
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,839
to achieve but uh with that i'm going to

1270
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,839
say thank you and come to my workshop

1271
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,549
[Applause]

1272
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,359
and get some stickers
