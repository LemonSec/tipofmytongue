1
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
okay

2
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:48,719
all right so um

3
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:52,479
this talk is gonna be on

4
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,400
open banking or whatever that is

5
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,318
and it's also gonna be a bit a journey

6
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,280
of what i've been doing

7
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,280
uh for the past approximately four years

8
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,840
so

9
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,840
this will of course be a little bit

10
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
about the company that i'm with but also

11
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,758
some of the stuff that we've been doing

12
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,479
in the open banking world uh should of

13
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,960
course not be necessarily seen as

14
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,680
an advertisement talk but please see it

15
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,599
um

16
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,880
and question it with everything that you

17
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,719
think is relevant for this

18
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,000
over the past um long time

19
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,400
we i've been working on

20
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,840
one of the last bastions of open data

21
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,039
that is back in the world

22
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,000
like one of the places where financial

23
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,000
data is

24
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,360
sort of data's generally hidden away and

25
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,440
interoperability is really

26
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
poor has been traditionally within the

27
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,160
banking sector

28
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
and and the the sad fact is that open

29
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,080
banking is

30
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,520
is extremely closed even though the

31
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,000
some of the new initiatives that have

32
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,719
been on the market here is still an

33
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,199
extremely high bar to entry into

34
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,400
the financial sector a lot of this has

35
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,879
to do with regulation

36
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,599
a lot of this has to be do with

37
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,319
traditional

38
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,840
defensive strategies that banks already

39
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,800
always have had

40
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,919
to like wall in their world

41
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,440
the reason why i got into

42
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,359
finance financial data is a company that

43
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,599
i i worked with

44
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,039
uh maybe four five six years ago

45
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,700
where i started working with this

46
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,919
company from oahu's

47
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,680
[Music]

48
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,760
called sp i don't know if you ever seen

49
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,799
it but we do some

50
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,319
financial planning

51
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,959
especially try to help young people

52
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,959
understand their financial situation

53
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,959
in order to build this product

54
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,000
we had to have some technology that i'm

55
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,040
going to go into

56
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,040
in a moment um

57
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,240
we we after this we kind of split into

58
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,680
two things so when i'm

59
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,160
talking about noted kpi gateway

60
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,760
everything is that is a technology

61
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
uh to connect to banks to get

62
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,120
information from banks to do payments on

63
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
banks whereas everything that is related

64
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
to sphere

65
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,319
is about the consumer facing the product

66
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,040
that's trying to be friendly to the

67
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
consumer

68
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,319
trying to help them understand the

69
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,360
digital economy

70
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,480
whereas in the old days you would kind

71
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,640
of

72
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,480
you would pilots away a budget that

73
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,760
would be like having uh some jar in the

74
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,560
kitchen where you put like

75
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,839
200 kroners in every week and that was

76
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,119
like your budget right and you would

77
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,720
pick out money from it during the week

78
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,480
when you do grocery shopping

79
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,160
but today it's like it's a digital

80
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,080
economy you have

81
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,319
multiple cards you have transactions

82
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,760
that have been drawn at different times

83
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,680
it's really really hard to get an

84
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,399
overview of it and you get offered a lot

85
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,560
of

86
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,480
external payment products like suddenly

87
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
you have you have the possibility of

88
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,760
having multiple banks

89
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
you have the possibility of credit cards

90
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,160
and other things where it's

91
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,560
extremely complicated it's going to

92
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,319
overview of your financial situation

93
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,079
all of that stuff does not really have

94
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,680
to do with trying to get the data from

95
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,920
the banks but also it's

96
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,719
an exercise trying to help people

97
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,599
but a little bit of a history lesson

98
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,320
spear started out

99
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,079
as google analytics mentality to your

100
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,480
economy

101
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,160
so we tried to make a product that was

102
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,720
let me just get an overview what's going

103
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,319
on

104
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,200
in my finances does not have to be

105
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,640
like does not have to be up to date

106
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,079
every day but it needs to be like i need

107
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,360
some general trends here i need to

108
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,160
understand whether

109
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,079
in two months uh i will have a problem

110
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,839
paying back my loans for instance

111
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,760
and what happened was you can almost see

112
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,440
it here this is the view of

113
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:52,399
our solution

114
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,519
where you can kind of have an idea of of

115
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,720
your economy

116
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,519
but in the very google analytics style

117
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,880
we've since moved away from this but

118
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
this was like the initial

119
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,880
take on trying to understand your

120
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,399
finances such a financial overview was

121
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,360
not available within the banks at that

122
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,920
time

123
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,120
uh once we started this trend the banks

124
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,319
were kind of saying

125
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,560
so and thing and then they kind of

126
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
copied this sort of google analytics

127
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,560
approach

128
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,880
um to their economy so i'm not i'm not

129
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,399
say

130
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,920
it's still valid for some people to have

131
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,519
an overview this way

132
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,199
but what we think today is it's probably

133
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,760
going to be much more up-to-date

134
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,600
and much more relevant in this in in

135
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,240
sort of the day-to-day situation

136
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,800
rather than um something that you look

137
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,880
on every three months essentially

138
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,839
because you make bad decisions every day

139
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,760
or you might need guidance every day

140
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,880
but something was problematic for this

141
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,200
solution like it was

142
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,880
really really a burning platform and the

143
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,959
major problem here

144
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,040
is that for this to work you had to get

145
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,359
data that's to get some sort of data

146
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,279
into the engine so we could do some

147
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,880
categorization of your expenses we could

148
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,480
figure out where it's going like

149
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,079
are you in the position the negative

150
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,920
trend and where are you funneling all

151
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,920
your monitor

152
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,439
and get downloading csv and uploading

153
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,760
csv is like

154
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,959
it's a user journey that is really hard

155
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,279
but how do you do that

156
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,719
on a phone right it's really really hard

157
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,439
to do that on the phone therefore it was

158
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,160
a hard

159
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
thing to do this in a way where you

160
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,719
could do it

161
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,800
on on an everyday basis

162
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,240
so what we figured out that since all

163
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,359
the banks were launching mobile apps as

164
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,160
well

165
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
can we just you know use the same apis

166
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,240
they use in their mobile app so we

167
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,279
started

168
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,519
doing sort of an approach where we said

169
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,240
okay the banks will not allow us to do

170
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
this

171
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
well not we engaged in banks talks with

172
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,040
banks trying to get data out of the

173
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,839
banks trying to get

174
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,040
like api access but nobody was really

175
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,160
talking to us

176
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,160
so there was another thing which was

177
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,920
that

178
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,319
we were essentially trying to make

179
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,519
injurability right we tried to make a

180
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,639
piece of software that would work with

181
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,160
your bank

182
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,200
rather than uh only data being residing

183
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
within the bank

184
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,959
and in the european union and the

185
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,279
copyright director

186
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,199
there's actually precedence of where you

187
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,399
can do reverse engineering

188
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,160
based on interoperability so what we did

189
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,320
was we were presenting another view

190
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,760
so think of it as open office compared

191
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,760
to microsoft office

192
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
you're allowed to reverse engineer the

193
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,319
window microsoft office

194
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,959
in order to make a viewer for the data

195
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,110
and so we

196
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,760
apply the same principles

197
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:36,320
[Music]

198
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,160
and then we moved into a regime where we

199
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,279
started doing reverse engineering

200
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,319
um for this so a bit about terminology

201
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,079
here so the legal

202
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,600
legal basis for doing all of this is

203
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,040
that we can do it because of

204
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,880
interoperability under the copyright

205
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,839
directive otherwise it's kind of frowned

206
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,160
upon

207
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,279
or even illegal to re-engineer other

208
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,880
people's solutions

209
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
but if you have a specific purpose that

210
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,560
is that is okay within the copyrighted

211
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,880
directive or national legislation then

212
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,719
it should be okay

213
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,079
we considered doing other things even

214
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,519
though i think that

215
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,800
if you're just doing like html

216
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,839
screenshaping or you're reverse

217
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,639
engineering an app

218
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,560
you're not doing anything distinctly

219
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,399
different between the two things

220
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,638
it's still like trying to access like

221
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
you you're going behind the view looking

222
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,160
at the network traffic

223
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,279
decoding the network traffic therefore

224
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:29,040
we we move towards sort of api based

225
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,880
scraping or app based scraping where we

226
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,480
we reverse engineer the app and check

227
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,240
out the apis from there rather than

228
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,720
doing it on the

229
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,000
sort of screen scraping solution and and

230
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,600
the reason is that

231
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
uh screenshotting is very fragile if

232
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,240
they make a change to the html webpage

233
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,760
it's it's gonna break fairly soon

234
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
whereas an app it sort of have

235
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,600
sort of this app update life cycle they

236
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,800
have to push out a new update if they

237
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,399
want to change things

238
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,040
and that gives us a chance to do this

239
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,240
actually in an operational manner

240
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,079
um another good thing about doing uh

241
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,480
apis that we limit the data that we

242
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,920
access and we don't want to scrape stuff

243
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,240
like we don't want to scrape the name of

244
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
your

245
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,760
of your advisor in your bank even though

246
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,639
that comes up on every web page that you

247
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,120
browse to

248
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,839
even you that you got just try to get or

249
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,959
fetch transactions

250
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,120
we when we go by api we can kind of

251
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,800
narrow our scope to ensure that we only

252
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,240
fetch the data that we need

253
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,839
and this is actually fairly important

254
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,560
for us we don't want to access data that

255
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,000
we don't need because it's just

256
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,479
it's just an accident waiting to happen

257
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,040
right so one of the things we focused on

258
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,040
was

259
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,319
was trying to do these app-based reverse

260
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,160
engineerings

261
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,000
and we saw that sweden was doing this

262
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,600
very well as well so this is a product

263
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,199
called bank droid

264
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,720
it was an open source project in sweden

265
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,000
where it was they were

266
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,399
probably at the same time we were doing

267
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,160
this doing the same thing in sweden

268
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,320
where they had an open open source

269
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,800
repository where you could

270
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,480
like make plugins for your banks and

271
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,800
then compared to sweden

272
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,480
and denmark sweden is much more focused

273
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,800
on having multiple banks and multiple

274
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,440
cars there's a lot of loyalty schemes

275
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,880
uh tied to credit cards pensions so it's

276
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,560
the problem having multiple banks in

277
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,000
sweden is a much bigger problem than it

278
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,638
is was in denmark at the point so they

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,480
were really

280
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,000
aggregating accounts from many different

281
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,160
sources into one view so you had an

282
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,759
overview of your financials

283
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,240
so we're kind of looking to the same

284
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,399
methodology here

285
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,160
so most of this stuff back in 2013 that

286
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,360
was basically you know just putting

287
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,639
midden proxy

288
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,480
on the apps so that was we didn't really

289
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,000
have to reverse engineer

290
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,240
the application itself we would just

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,759
like sniff that traffic maybe

292
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
yeah at that point it was basically

293
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,959
sniffing the lever traffic because

294
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,480
all the gls stuff was not really

295
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,239
hardened at that point

296
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,560
so that was very easy

297
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,959
and then the situation was a bit like

298
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,279
this you know we went from

299
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,800
you know we had an app we had somebody

300
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,759
who could log into the app

301
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,800
um it could be me for instance i have i

302
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,560
think bank uh

303
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,160
15 banks or something like that i can

304
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,920
log into

305
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,360
because i open the account with them so

306
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,599
you can log into a bank

307
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,799
and then you we we scraped the network

308
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,039
traffic

309
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,359
we implemented this in some code we ran

310
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,160
into production and you can fetch data

311
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,958
just based and automated and live data

312
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
all the time

313
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,160
that was really important because then

314
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,959
you actually started being able to

315
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,799
navigate from

316
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,280
for you for sort of all this analytics

317
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,839
that got put onto your

318
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,079
uh your view so what the banks did was

319
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,039
they were doing like oh shit

320
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,799
somebody is in our apps they're in our

321
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,440
datas

322
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,720
how how do we stop them from there right

323
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,520
so what they did is they

324
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,320
they they wave their magic wand over the

325
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,520
app

326
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,280
they bought um solutions from

327
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
various companies or they tried to do it

328
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,960
in-house where they either do

329
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,919
did like you know childish stuff like

330
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,120
not child stuff low-level stuff like

331
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,480
trying to

332
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,479
um uh just do

333
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,320
anything same things like certificate

334
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,039
pinning but of course that can be

335
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,960
bypassed

336
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,480
if you know where that is and then you

337
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,200
were moving up into sort of

338
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,640
app heartening and there's a lot of

339
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,080
vendors out there that will sell you a

340
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
lot of solutions

341
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,000
but all of them can given enough time

342
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,120
and a dedicated

343
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,039
team uh be managed

344
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,799
so we applied a bit of cyber to it and

345
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,240
then we successfully

346
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,520
time of the time um like made it through

347
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,200
all these obstacles that would put in

348
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,760
place and this was a life cycle

349
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,440
sometimes it could happen every week

350
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
essentially they would put out a release

351
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,679
on third on tuesdays

352
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,559
we would download the updates have a

353
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,720
patch ready

354
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,799
by the time they they turned on the the

355
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,559
feature flag in production

356
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,480
so it could be we had down times or

357
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,840
maybe two minutes or ten minutes when we

358
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,880
detected that turned on the new

359
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,399
functionality

360
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,919
then we turned on the feature flag on

361
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,840
our end so this was kind of a

362
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,679
a bit like a cat and mouse game right

363
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,280
so um how do you reverse engineer

364
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,160
production i guess it's a bit

365
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,120
different than or a little like

366
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,360
large-scale

367
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,639
malware analysis actually so first of

368
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,520
all you need to have some olsen

369
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,280
colleagues and i'm

370
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,799
very fortunate to work with some really

371
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,918
bright minds when it comes to reverse

372
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,559
engineering

373
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,240
um that helps a lot because the more you

374
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,160
are the better you are at

375
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,520
like collaborating and talking about the

376
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,000
problems and figuring out how to

377
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,200
to handle them and then you need to find

378
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,440
some tools that work for you

379
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,520
and for us it's a combination of static

380
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
and dynamic analysis so a lot of the

381
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,400
stuff can be done in a static level

382
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,320
but we also run some dynamic analysis

383
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,919
tools and i would just like give a

384
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
great shout out to frida which is an

385
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,300
awesome tool especially in the mobile

386
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,400
domain

387
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,799
[Music]

388
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,520
then we're working in in a way where we

389
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,918
do

390
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
automatic in in malware it would be

391
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,240
automatic sample fetching but we have

392
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,160
like a butt

393
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,919
that downloads stuff from the app store

394
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,440
keeps us updated about

395
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,840
new releases to make sure that we're on

396
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,360
top of that

397
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,520
we do some automatic decompiling and

398
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,360
initial analysis so we don't have to

399
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,760
look into every sample ourselves just to

400
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,360
see what changed

401
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,799
and and we have some assessments of

402
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,840
whether we need to re-reverse

403
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,120
anything if things change

404
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,039
and then of course we develop some

405
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,959
in-house tools which we cannot release

406
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,080
because if we release them

407
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,760
the vendors will then use them against

408
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,360
us so it's right now we have some

409
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,720
proprietary tools where we

410
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,158
can circumvent most of the

411
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,880
fingerprinting and most of the security

412
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,880
frameworks out there

413
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,280
using this methodology weird at probably

414
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,720
like

415
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,000
50 um apis that we integrate to

416
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,840
this is more than 300 banks or 500

417
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,360
flavors of banks so that includes like a

418
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,639
corporate channel and a business

419
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,760
sorry a private channel for instance

420
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,919
so a little bit of the shenanigans that

421
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,760
we go through

422
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,039
sometimes you can unmask things when you

423
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
look at it and

424
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,879
sometimes these things are not very

425
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,320
cleverly hidden good example is this

426
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,320
that you know you have a file called

427
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,158
icon png

428
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,480
but when you look closer at that icon

429
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,880
png it's kind of in the wrong place and

430
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,520
and stuff like that so you look a little

431
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,039
bit

432
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,240
in the code further and if you just

433
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,240
export with something it's actually a

434
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,039
public key

435
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,480
so they there's a lot of things that are

436
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,039
just

437
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,799
very simple obfuscation that somebody

438
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,559
tried to be clever about so

439
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,720
that's one end of it and then there's

440
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,678
the full like professional obfuscation

441
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,080
tools

442
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,360
this one is a little more you know you

443
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,799
laugh a little bit when you find it

444
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,000
because it took like five minutes to

445
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,520
figure it out but it probably took a

446
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,520
banking team

447
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,679
i don't know multiple cycles just to

448
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,600
develop it so it's also like the the

449
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,039
adversarial effect here is that

450
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,039
we are much faster and we move much

451
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,000
faster than they have to put up stuff

452
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,840
like this

453
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,520
to to keep us on another realization you

454
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,240
do is that everything is just mainframes

455
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,799
man

456
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,240
like it's it it's banking and it's

457
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,280
mainframes and everything you see is

458
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,200
mainframes

459
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,879
so here's an example from one api in

460
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,720
sweden um

461
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
you kind of get reports from all the

462
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,480
mainframes and all the ibm products that

463
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,399
came through or you just appended to the

464
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,960
json object send out directly to the

465
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,120
client like

466
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,840
describing and in the bottom there's

467
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,439
like this desperate cry for help

468
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,280
where it's like says if you want to work

469
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,559
with us call us put into some field

470
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,639
because they know somebody's looking

471
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,520
into this traffic

472
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,559
but um yeah it's that that part has been

473
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,200
always interesting to

474
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,799
kind of you you get almost a feeling of

475
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,000
how the organization works on the inside

476
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,600
like how well structures

477
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
internal apis are compared to your

478
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,799
public apis it's always

479
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:47,840
a bit of almost a sociology study

480
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,840
anyways by 2014 we have access to all

481
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,320
the danish major banks so

482
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,918
denmark you might be aware has a bunch

483
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,799
of banks like we have 80 something banks

484
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
in denmark

485
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,200
but all of them are governed either by

486
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,158
their own infrastructure

487
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,280
uh that would be nordia and danske bank

488
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,640
and the rest are running on what's

489
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,840
called banking centrals

490
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,360
there are three of those and then market

491
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,959
one is called bangdaiser one is called

492
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:14,158
sdc and one is called bec

493
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,480
and all of these were

494
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,480
kind of what you needed to cover this

495
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,960
country

496
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,480
and it was pretty much like a cat and

497
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,520
mouse game and it's been going on

498
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,559
it was going on for from 13 until

499
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,240
18 i would say where we had to like we

500
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,120
were doing this sort of lock step every

501
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,120
time

502
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,799
they made a change we made a change and

503
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,799
keeping on the radar at the same time

504
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,400
and trying to avoid it and in the end

505
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,840
we just felt that people were giving up

506
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
like

507
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,120
they they stopped pushing more updates

508
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,639
trying to hold us out of this

509
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,439
world so that was pretty funny then uh

510
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,480
the european

511
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:54,559
union suddenly stepped in

512
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,559
this was in 2015.

513
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,080
there was a new update to what's called

514
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,360
the payment services directive version 2

515
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,879
where they said basically if you stop

516
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,158
reversing

517
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,400
banks will give you apis or if you don't

518
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,440
then you can continue to do it but there

519
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,760
will be some like

520
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,799
smaller things so this was basically the

521
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,440
premise we got like

522
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,559
piece 2 is a great piece of legislation

523
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,000
many kinds

524
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,320
like there's a lot of like

525
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,600
you cannot charge extras if you use a

526
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
specific credit card there's a lot of

527
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,719
like open

528
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,039
competition between different banks and

529
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,320
different

530
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,240
card issuers and stuff like that so

531
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,840
there's a lot of competition being baked

532
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,919
into this

533
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,840
but here we were made a promise that the

534
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,799
banks were would give us apis

535
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,240
if we stopped reversing and pretty much

536
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,879
what happened is like

537
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,799
yeah great you know now we can actually

538
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,520
build a business a little bit more

539
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,520
robustly it can also mean that we we can

540
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,559
start catering to some customers which

541
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,360
are um a bit uncertain about the

542
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,879
situation

543
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,678
that we don't have an agreement with

544
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,039
anybody and we just reverse our way in

545
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,720
that could be of instance if you have an

546
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,080
accounting system that needs access to

547
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,480
bank accounts

548
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,600
that is fairly dominant in within the

549
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,679
sector that

550
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,279
if you if you're trying to do accounting

551
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,200
a lot of the stuff in denmark is still

552
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,559
gone by csv uploads and downloads and

553
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,960
you have people that

554
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,399
whose entire job is to download csv and

555
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,240
upload csv

556
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,640
and and i think that you know it's a

557
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,200
shame to use resources this way it's

558
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,559
it's like mind numbing work sometimes

559
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,799
right so

560
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,960
it's better to to use this energy for

561
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,639
something where we're actually a bit

562
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,559
we can we can use the energy a little

563
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,360
better

564
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,760
so um the problem is that that was a

565
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,199
cost

566
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,840
to this and that means that we have to

567
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,840
become regulated and becoming regulated

568
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,080
under the danish financial

569
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,159
system that that's pretty heavy so it is

570
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,919
like documentation

571
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,000
uh like we never seen it before so

572
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,520
suddenly it it it was kind of like this

573
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,640
bargain where we could get probably get

574
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,480
some nicer

575
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,320
ways and it was a little bit easier to

576
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,400
do explain what we did

577
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,639
as a business but on the other side it

578
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,080
would be like yeah you have to file this

579
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,360
50 page report every year and

580
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,439
you have to go through some things

581
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,120
that were not extremely relevant to the

582
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,559
business operation that we had

583
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,479
but anyways because we are under this

584
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,120
umbrella of financial institutions

585
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,159
then suddenly it covers you as well but

586
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,039
that allows us to

587
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,559
to flesh out the part of our technology

588
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,120
that was in spear

589
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,760
as a separate business entity which i

590
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,760
was helping co-founding

591
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,520
that also meant that we moved from

592
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,279
little denmark into norway sweden and

593
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,879
finland based on reverse engineering

594
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,159
because at that time the apis were not

595
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,360
really ready yet

596
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,600
and then in come 2018

597
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,639
ps22 went into effect um

598
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,080
[Music]

599
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,080
and that was

600
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,480
like we were really really really

601
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,639
looking forward to this part

602
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,960
but the problem was that when the banks

603
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,279
were supposed to deliver the apis

604
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,799
it was kind of looking at you know

605
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,880
nothing

606
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,240
there was it was just a desert like all

607
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,600
the apis were not ready

608
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,919
all the apis were not tested and i can

609
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,240
tell you that this was the view in 2018

610
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,520
and

611
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,760
sometimes even the view today and and

612
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,879
it's just mildly frustrating that

613
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,399
that we still are in a situation where

614
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,399
there was this great promise that we

615
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,439
should stop reverse engineering

616
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,279
um and that would give us

617
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,480
an access on the regulation that we

618
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,159
could actually do the things that the

619
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,000
customers really want like the customers

620
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,440
really want to have access to this data

621
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,799
and that's because we are like google

622
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
and just want to harvest data like we

623
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,120
just

624
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,840
we're just facilitating access to things

625
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,799
that people really want right

626
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,480
so uh so so it's a little bit better now

627
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,158
but it it was really bad

628
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,480
and some of the things that we saw was

629
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,919
kind of like horrible like we we had to

630
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,559
do things that were

631
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,000
like things that were extremely

632
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,799
over-engineered

633
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,159
in terms of access to these things so we

634
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,080
had to provide

635
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,279
science software statements signed by

636
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,439
multiple certificates by multiple

637
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,720
authors but these software statements

638
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,399
for instance

639
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,480
which kind of define your application

640
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,918
and stuff was not really defined how we

641
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,279
should define it so we had to kind of

642
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,960
guess so every time

643
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,960
we we submitted a software statement we

644
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,360
would get an error back telling us which

645
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,960
key of the json we forgot to fill out

646
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,479
so it was kind of like fill trying to

647
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,159
fill out something and then ah you're

648
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,760
missing you logo ui

649
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,520
okay next one uh you're missing uh your

650
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,120
name of your client okay and then the

651
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,960
next one nothing was documented right so

652
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,959
we had to go this like this

653
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,960
and then we went through this procedure

654
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,679
and then we continued until we hit the

655
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,279
end

656
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,600
which was http status 304 undefined

657
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,120
which kind of just said like what the f

658
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,959
are we doing here

659
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,879
and this has been like the the journey

660
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,360
for us like another example this is like

661
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,840
um

662
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,678
and this is like quoting from public

663
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,720
documentation

664
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,480
um you need to send that the digest in

665
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,840
json and make the digest

666
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,840
of the complete json string xvv

667
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,520
jason it was just like complete

668
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,320
gibberish

669
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,440
what what we ended up seeing and then

670
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,240
and this is sort of

671
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,600
the solution today is like there's

672
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,279
somehow it is

673
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,639
this is like a compliance exercise for

674
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,480
the banks like they were forced to to

675
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,760
make all these apis

676
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,360
um but they were not really able to

677
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,919
deliver them as products

678
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,918
so so what it is is that there's a huge

679
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,799
hesitance at least with some banks to to

680
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,080
provide

681
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:47,120
apis and

682
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,480
by that hesitance it kind of shines

683
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,239
through through the product which means

684
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,640
that it's almost impossible to use

685
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,000
i'm bashing banks a lot but some banks

686
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,919
are actually pretty good with it but

687
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,480
like the majority of stuff out there is

688
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,000
pretty pretty saddening

689
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,840
there's stuff like this you know this is

690
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,640
what they expect the consumer to

691
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,639
to use so this is an authentication

692
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,880
method in sweden called bank id

693
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,880
and they expect users to you know choose

694
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,880
something on the list there

695
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,320
where it's not even a link but it's like

696
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,840
a on click

697
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,520
something that was made blue and then

698
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,600
some pop-up jumps up and then you are

699
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,000
supposed to authenticate the qr code on

700
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,678
your mobile

701
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,080
device like you know you have to have

702
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
multiple mirrors in order to do that

703
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,199
so there are things that were not really

704
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,799
working at all in a mobile domain

705
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,880
and that includes like error messages

706
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,639
that you know you don't even know what

707
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,039
under like what it means where it's just

708
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,480
like

709
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,080
completely like some internal error

710
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,440
message that was just put in the face of

711
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,960
the end user

712
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,640
so we've seen it from time to time again

713
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,880
and then i think that the one that was

714
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,480
kind of breaking our neck

715
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,520
was uh was production changes constantly

716
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,480
we were getting fairly used to to

717
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,000
changes uh with sort of this mobile app

718
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,519
update cycle where they had to push a

719
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,310
new client every time

720
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,840
in order to uh to make sure that um

721
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,360
[Music]

722
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,879
they had some lead time you know so not

723
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,559
to deprecate the api

724
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,240
immediately after therefore we could

725
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,760
follow along we actually got like almost

726
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,600
like a change notification they pushed a

727
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,039
new update right

728
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,120
but yes things are just changing in

729
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,720
production they forgot to tell us and

730
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,320
then this has also been a

731
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,399
been a challenging time

732
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,480
so i would say that the the the

733
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,279
landscape of open banking right now is a

734
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,519
completely

735
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,279
a mess i think we're getting a hand

736
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,440
handle on it right now like because we

737
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,559
come from a strong reversing

738
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,080
reverse engineering culture um

739
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,918
we we we kind of get that we need to

740
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,840
look deeper beyond documentation and

741
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,000
understand more things than are being

742
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,120
said overly

743
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,919
and therefore it's it's it's a little

744
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,439
easier for us

745
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,600
at least to move in this field but we

746
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,279
see like larger institutions that are

747
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,678
trying to move into this field

748
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,039
they're completely blown back by the

749
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,700
level of maturity in the in

750
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,279
in this world

751
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,360
[Music]

752
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,120
and in the end i think the realization

753
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,639
is that we're still running on really

754
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,320
ancient technology even though you can

755
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,679
have these flashy banks and beautiful

756
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,519
banks and stuff like that

757
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,519
a lot of the a lot of the banks are

758
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:20,480
still running on a core platform that is

759
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,279
ancient um some of the examples that are

760
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,840
brought up here

761
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,960
are you know many of the institutions at

762
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,080
least in denmark are still running on

763
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
mainframes

764
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,120
some have transitions away from

765
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,879
mainframes but it it's not because

766
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,918
mainframes per se is a bad thing but it

767
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,159
just indicates that

768
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,840
that sort of their movement speed and

769
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,960
their applications they're fairly old

770
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,279
and it takes

771
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,080
it's harder for them to move out of this

772
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,360
sort of

773
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,080
old way of doing it but i would say that

774
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,760
there's light

775
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,120
at the end of the tunnel i think that

776
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,720
probably this year

777
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,439
and and the next year is the years where

778
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,559
we'll see everything starting to work

779
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,000
for real

780
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,918
um in on september 14th last

781
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,320
year was the date when everything needed

782
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,519
to be in production and production ready

783
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,760
and we're still seeing things that are

784
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,159
not in production so it's and that is by

785
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,519
law

786
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,120
so so banks are now almost a year

787
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,559
delayed they were actually supposed to

788
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,879
be in production

789
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,760
the 13th of june uh so it's more than a

790
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,960
year now

791
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,000
since they were supposed to be in

792
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
production but now we've seen the

793
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,159
regulators also starting actually to

794
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,279
help us

795
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,919
which is very nice but i think it's it's

796
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,519
been a journey where every party of this

797
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,159
it's completely new like

798
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,200
banks are not really interested in this

799
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,720
or we're not

800
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,559
but now they're also starting to see

801
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,559
that they they actually can

802
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,120
like if they provide a really really

803
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,879
poor experience towards the end users

804
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,158
we're seeing customers leave banks for

805
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
that purpose specifically

806
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,240
so it could be in the end that if you as

807
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,240
a bank of you as like a large

808
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,760
corporation do not offer the possibility

809
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,080
of working with your own data or if

810
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,000
you're

811
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,918
not working with your financial data of

812
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,120
your company and have an easy way to

813
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,480
pull it in and out

814
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,158
then you probably end up in a situation

815
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,840
where where this is this will be a

816
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,880
competition point at some point

817
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,320
because it's the the the

818
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,679
immediate effects of this are so um

819
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,120
it's so easy to see it when you're a

820
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,040
business owner for instance that you

821
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,078
don't have to upload and download csvs

822
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,480
it's just a paint ring so um

823
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:15,919
i'm a little bit short like done on time

824
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,000
now so i'm sorry about a

825
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,679
very short talk here but i don't know if

826
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,639
anybody has some questions to me and i'd

827
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,079
love to answer them

828
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,079
also very technical stuff

829
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,279
so the question was how badly can the

830
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,239
banks be fined uh so right now i think

831
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,079
it's more

832
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:48,799
of a carrot than stick at the moment um

833
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,560
so the banks have to maintain a

834
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,000
interface that we can connect to

835
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,000
like some sort of endpoints that we

836
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,719
connect to and what

837
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,320
the regulators at least as we understand

838
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,319
have the possibility to do is that they

839
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,599
can make them do more documentation on

840
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,280
their internal stuff

841
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,960
so we can continue to use it in a safe

842
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,359
manner um

843
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,960
and that is probably where they will

844
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,400
consider whether they want to push the

845
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,240
other thing to production rather than us

846
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,440
getting too many insights to it

847
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,200
in the end you they can get fines if

848
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,760
they don't provide what we need

849
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,759
essentially

850
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,960
so it's the question was whether we

851
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,319
found any security vulnerabilities

852
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,720
and i would say that apps

853
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,320
provided for instance for from banks are

854
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,359
very very

855
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,520
very well um screened

856
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,160
i it my impression is that there's a lot

857
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,160
of time invested with external auditors

858
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,839
trying to to see this so i think that

859
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,040
generally like the attack service is

860
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,000
very

861
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,920
limited first of all um and and sort of

862
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
the malicious stuff that we can do

863
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,440
is almost non-existent because the

864
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,359
everything is so hardened that they

865
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,960
don't trust the clients essentially

866
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,640
so the clients because you know you can

867
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,839
run on route devices you know that it's

868
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,920
a hostile environment you're running

869
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,400
code and something you don't control

870
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,320
generally everything there is not like

871
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,359
nothing business critical is going on on

872
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
the devices per se

873
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,480
unless there's like a hardware security

874
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,760
element where you can store key and

875
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,880
stuff like that

876
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,359
um so so attacks that we see like our

877
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,440
our

878
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,880
like the threat model that we are to to

879
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,640
these apps are different than the threat

880
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,560
model of a malicious attacker

881
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,319
so because like we have the full flow

882
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,078
like we have the user present we can log

883
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,599
in we can do all the things

884
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,520
it's a different threat model right the

885
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,839
other thing is like if you have somebody

886
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,359
like

887
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,880
downloading a malicious app from the app

888
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,078
store how would that

889
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,079
affect it and generally we don't see any

890
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,599
uh security vulnerabilities but we see

891
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,040
insecure practices for instance of

892
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,359
implementing cryptography

893
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,520
but those instances are solely or

894
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,279
like exclusively for obfuscation

895
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,480
purposes like it does not serve a

896
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,599
security purpose

897
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,800
but it's it's uh it's mainly like mostly

898
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,040
used to throw us off

899
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,480
trying to reverse engineer the apis and

900
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,400
there we have seen

901
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,240
things that um where cryptographers

902
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,960
would probably cry

903
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,520
um and and that includes like simple

904
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:20,000
things like uh

905
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,000
reuse of ivs and stuff like that yeah

906
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,078
the question was whether we will have

907
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,520
like a personal api

908
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,720
and i think that i think there will be

909
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,040
due to the way that it suddenly got

910
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,200
regulated i think it will be even harder

911
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,640
like i have some puzzles in my head that

912
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,000
at least some of the private stuff

913
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,920
should be regulated under data

914
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,359
portability of the gdpr

915
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,200
where some of the things that we do on a

916
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,839
personal level should be exposed that

917
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,359
way

918
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,440
or could be exposed that way where the

919
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,319
banks would not have any liability

920
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,480
um for uh having to check licenses and

921
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,760
stuff of the ones that expose the data

922
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,520
but as for like just getting an

923
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,520
api to your bank um i'm not sure i i've

924
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,160
seen banks in sweden no sorry in norway

925
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,920
doing this

926
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,680
um where they did it where they had a

927
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,200
developer portal and you could

928
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,839
access your own personal data through

929
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,839
the api

930
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,200
yeah so yeah so you say that there was a

931
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,040
common thing in germany i think that you

932
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,319
know some some markets are more mature

933
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,440
to this i think that the swedish markets

934
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,880
for instance they're

935
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,839
like completely accepting reverse

936
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,640
engineering for instance where the

937
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,160
danish market

938
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,839
is adverse to it and the norwegian

939
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,640
market is completely screaming when you

940
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,480
mention it

941
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,440
so there's also you clearly see the

942
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,359
differences in the

943
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,760
local mentality of the different markets

944
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,720
and it's very clear that the union is

945
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,359
is very segregated on on on borders that

946
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,560
mentality does not travel across borders

947
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,119
um but what we we do see

948
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,560
some banks i think that especially in

949
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,560
sort of the

950
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,920
sort of new banking era that we're

951
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,480
seeing where there are some challenges

952
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
coming in

953
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,480
i would expect one of them at some point

954
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,000
to launch some sort of connectivity

955
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,079
but i think that the regulation that has

956
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,800
been put in place now means that it

957
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,720
actually

958
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,480
had become harder and i would actually

959
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,118
personally resort to rear engineering in

960
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,040
order to

961
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,359
get access to my personal thank bank

962
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,359
account

963
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,839
yes

964
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,839
credit card

965
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,118
yeah so the question was in denmark we

966
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,680
see

967
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,320
a very like single source bank approach

968
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,240
and in

969
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,440
in other markets we see multiple

970
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:03,118
multibanks or

971
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,400
credit cards and whether we see a rising

972
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,520
trend in denmark on this

973
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,280
um would probably true yeah we see some

974
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,000
challenges coming in and and

975
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,200
but it's still a fairly low percentage

976
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,119
of the users

977
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,640
that will attach more than one bank

978
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,760
account to spear

979
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,040
uh it's not necessarily like it's small

980
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,359
small double digits i would say um

981
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,880
that would try to do it at least um but

982
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,480
what what have happened also is that we

983
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,760
have added other sources as well that

984
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,400
will complement your data

985
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,760
so it that could play into this one of

986
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,640
the things we add is high support of

987
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,319
instance

988
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,400
which is which is just like your

989
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,520
travel card that you can attach into

990
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,400
your your

991
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,000
your financials so what happens on on

992
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,440
the travel card is that you you put

993
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,960
money onto the travel card

994
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,400
which is kind of like a credit card like

995
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,160
you put some that's what it works like a

996
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,880
debit card you put some money on it and

997
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,720
you

998
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,640
deduct money from the account when you

999
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,240
travel

1000
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,078
it's impossible to use if you're trying

1001
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,279
to figure out whether you know you want

1002
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,599
to price compare different products

1003
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,359
because

1004
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,800
all you see is like every once in a

1005
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:06,000
while you'd like chop up your account

1006
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,680
with a fixed amount and you

1007
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,680
you kind of don't get an idea where you

1008
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,279
travel to and from because that would be

1009
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,319
like individual line data so what we

1010
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
added was we added

1011
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,319
the travel card as a bank in our

1012
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,079
solution and we detect the

1013
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,440
the transfer from your account when you

1014
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,240
chop up the account and that just

1015
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,640
vanishes

1016
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,919
and then you just see individual travels

1017
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,920
as expenses instead

1018
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,839
yep

1019
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,839
uh

1020
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,280
yeah so the question is why why did we

1021
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,920
move away from

1022
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,800
um from the analytics approach to a more

1023
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,960
like personal

1024
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,400
and day-to-day approach which is what we

1025
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,720
did essentially

1026
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,520
um that is how i interview your question

1027
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,200
sorry about that

1028
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,440
and then the thing is that

1029
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,560
what we saw was that you know there's no

1030
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,640
you know

1031
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,319
nobody looks at analytics data every

1032
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,279
three months it's not something that you

1033
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,119
naturally look at on an app maybe if you

1034
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,280
have to do your budget yeah

1035
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,960
but then three months have passed and

1036
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,440
you have already steered out of course

1037
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,800
like

1038
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,160
you need to be able to navigate it's

1039
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,839
it's like initial navigating in a

1040
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,279
submarine right if you come up and get a

1041
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,960
bearing every three months

1042
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,960
you might be widely of course in three

1043
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,680
months and that is a demotivator right

1044
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,240
but if you get small navigation hints

1045
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,359
every day like from expenses that

1046
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,118
you follow your expenses you're

1047
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,240
following your budgets you're following

1048
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,920
it on a

1049
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,680
sort of daily basis and you actually

1050
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,119
have a relationship ah i actually went

1051
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,799
to the bar yesterday

1052
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,800
and i probably bought the other guys

1053
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,079
or girls too many drinks right you know

1054
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,839
i was too

1055
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,200
kind there it might be that the next

1056
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,880
time you go to the bar then you think oh

1057
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,399
it's probably the turn now

1058
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,000
and there then you have a chance to

1059
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,800
adjust your economy from that but if you

1060
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,839
get that sort of

1061
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,079
update updated report like you know

1062
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,680
hit in the head after three months then

1063
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,560
you know you just give up

1064
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,598
right so we just this is our live like

1065
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,359
trying to hate

1066
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,640
trying to help people sort of in a

1067
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,480
behavioral sense right

1068
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,319
trying to make sure that they they have

1069
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,880
the opportunity to be informed about

1070
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:33,279
their

1071
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,800
economy um in a way where they can

1072
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,960
actually act upon it

1073
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,839
but without being like judgmental or

1074
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,200
anything like that but

1075
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,839
just trying to give you hints of where

1076
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,839
your economy is going

1077
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,079
i don't know that was probably not

1078
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,078
answering your question

1079
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,680
okay

1080
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,359
all right i can uh just as like as

1081
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,000
closing like we're moving into payments

1082
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,078
now so

1083
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,599
it's it's it's a bit different game now

1084
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,280
so now we're starting to do

1085
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,800
account to account based payments as

1086
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,839
well on these

1087
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,599
apis um and this is of tremendous use

1088
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:14,640
for instance for a festival like this

1089
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,560
right where you don't want the extra

1090
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,960
overhead of paying attacks to somebody

1091
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,759
like

1092
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,720
to a card merchant or some middleman

1093
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,839
where you can actually get money

1094
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,279
directly into your account so it's

1095
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,640
something that we're working on directly

1096
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,920
at the moment trying to

1097
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,920
at least in the places where it means a

1098
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,000
lot where the margins mean a lot

1099
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,960
to provide direct buy bank payments

1100
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,839
rather than

1101
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,839
going by cards

1102
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:40,000
yeah yeah it's kind of like mobile pay

1103
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,118
but it's like

1104
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,720
just imagine that we're doing what's

1105
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,720
called payment initiation and sort of

1106
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,520
the framework

1107
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,520
we kind of fill in the form inside your

1108
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,680
web-based bank or your mobile bank

1109
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,599
and then you do the signing with mid or

1110
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,359
with your like signing credentials

1111
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,359
so it's like we we just initiate the

1112
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,920
payment on your behalf so but you

1113
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,440
you uh you approve it so it's just like

1114
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,720
filling in like going to one hack

1115
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,319
website and clicking a button

1116
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,480
to transfer money to ben hack for the

1117
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:08,640
ticket for instance that will just be

1118
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,079
deducted directly from your account into

1119
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,520
bone hex account not going through a

1120
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,040
middleman or

1121
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,800
like a payment gateway or anything like

1122
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,000
that just like a direct transfer

1123
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,520
as you would have done yourself but with

1124
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,119
instead of having to fill in the numbers

1125
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,160
and copy pasting and all that stuff you

1126
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,160
just swipe in mid

1127
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,720
we can talk about that we're live with

1128
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:43,598
it like we're running it live in finland

1129
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:43,598
for instance

1130
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,599
yeah so what would when we do penny

1131
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,359
payment initiation within the ps2

1132
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,720
framework which is like the golden thing

1133
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,000
that was promised to us from the

1134
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,359
from the european union right um we uh

1135
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,280
we do whatever is

1136
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:00,640
possible sorry we do whatever is

1137
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,400
possible for

1138
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,440
uh um from um

1139
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,880
the consumer's perspective

1140
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,720
so that means that we're just filling

1141
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,760
out forms that you can do in your mobile

1142
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,879
bank or in your

1143
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,079
web-based bank so the bank still figures

1144
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,720
out everything that has to do with

1145
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,720
banking

1146
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,078
like payment handling and all that stuff

1147
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,439
it's just like

1148
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,680
it's just a little bit like downloading

1149
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,880
csvs right the banks still have the data

1150
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,440
they still do all the stuff with the

1151
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,599
data

1152
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,839
we just automate that part so you don't

1153
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,480
have to click click click click download

1154
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,480
upload

1155
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,680
essentially we just do like enter your

1156
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,040
password and pin code and

1157
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,640
then we have like a robot doing it for

1158
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,000
you it's pretty much the same thing we

1159
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,240
do with payment initiation

1160
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,520
that is like we make the payment on your

1161
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,759
behalf

1162
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,200
and then the bank does the execution of

1163
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,400
it and that means that when you move

1164
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,000
into cross-border

1165
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,839
it might actually be better to use some

1166
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,280
different tactics with this

1167
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,480
it could be like some of the new

1168
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,079
challenges that are coming into this

1169
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,079
domain where they are

1170
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,920
where they're settling not directly from

1171
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,599
the bank but through a third party that

1172
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,280
has money in one country that needs to

1173
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,000
exchange it with a like the reverse

1174
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,160
transfer

1175
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and then you do local transfers instead

1176
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,598
there's many other ways of doing it than

1177
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,280
just like a bank transfer

1178
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,960
and that could be a way to solve the

1179
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,480
cross-border channels challenge because

1180
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,319
today cross-border at least from a

1181
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,920
danish account is very expensive

1182
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,440
if you move into the eurozone like

1183
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,760
separate transfers are

1184
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,960
the default so that that is different

1185
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:39,839
but for danish

1186
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:39,839
users it's different peter

1187
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,280
yeah so you should see that almost like

1188
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,240
in the developer terms like read write

1189
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,000
access right

1190
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,520
so we have like kind of read access that

1191
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,880
is called the account information

1192
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,960
service license

1193
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,720
that is the lowest one that is the

1194
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,480
easiest one to get

1195
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,240
um you have you still have like

1196
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,839
professional liability insurance and you

1197
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,040
still become a financial institution and

1198
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,799
stuff like that

1199
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,960
what happens and then if you go to the

1200
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,319
next license which is the right one

1201
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,480
which is called the payment initiation

1202
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,800
license payment initiation

1203
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,160
is defined by the way that we don't hold

1204
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,160
money for anybody we just

1205
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,279
execute orders that is

1206
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,879
then you're moving into what's called

1207
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,559
the payment institutions which is a

1208
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,240
higher regulated entity

1209
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,400
and you have to have higher insurances

1210
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:39,759
and higher compliance requirements

1211
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:42,319
so it is like real access is less than

1212
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,680
right essentially but makes sense here

1213
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:47,599
and then we will mostly like we don't

1214
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,040
expect that many to get these licenses

1215
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:50,720
but there will be some operators like

1216
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,920
payment gateways or us that will have

1217
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,520
these licenses

1218
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,720
would not be like a web shop does not

1219
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,720
need to have it essentially

1220
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:03,839
peter

1221
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,880
to have

1222
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,760
um so so what um

1223
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,040
mobile pace model is a little bit

1224
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,880
different does not work under the

1225
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,160
paymentation scheme right now as i

1226
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,520
understand it at least

1227
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,359
so they are not like a payment

1228
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,559
initiation service they are they have a

1229
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:52,880
different license that is

1230
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,400
greater than ours i would say probably

1231
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,040
um where they can do other things as

1232
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,119
well

1233
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,640
so they operate on different levels and

1234
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,240
they have individual agreements with the

1235
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,598
banks and how to transfer stuff and then

1236
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,520
they fall back on cards

1237
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,000
as well so they also have some card

1238
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,280
based payments so so there's like they

1239
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,200
they kind of have a hybrid solution

1240
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,440
between many different points

1241
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,558
but at one point some things like

1242
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,480
requirements to do

1243
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,599
strong customer authentication like

1244
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,040
doing mid

1245
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,720
approval of transfers and stuff like

1246
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,839
that might happen

1247
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,520
to hit nem id as well at some point uh

1248
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:25,359
when that completely is rolled out in

1249
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,880
denmark it was like delayed for 18

1250
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,558
months at some point because webshops

1251
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,480
did not implement it

1252
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,800
but at that point everything will be

1253
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,079
equalized like you have to use nemid to

1254
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,480
make a payment

1255
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,240
or you have to use your bank's mobile

1256
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,920
app to approve the payment

1257
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,240
with or something like that you have to

1258
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,559
have something that

1259
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,919
is a multi-factor authentication device

1260
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,480
that will approve the payment that

1261
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,079
fulfills a requirement of knowing that

1262
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,920
the user was present

1263
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,760
so i think at some point we'll probably

1264
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,640
see an equalization across different

1265
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,800
channels

1266
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,839
when the payment is executed from the

1267
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,880
like person

1268
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,839
it's a different thing when you do like

1269
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,200
the taking service and other things

1270
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:02,558
where it's like executed from the

1271
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,000
merchant side is that

1272
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,400
but like what's called psu user

1273
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,200
user-oriented payments at some point

1274
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,200
point will

1275
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,399
have to rely on the same level of fca

1276
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,160
requirements

1277
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,119
uh which would be like authentication

1278
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:18,640
needs to be the same across the phone

1279
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,319
um so i don't know what the future of an

1280
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,720
md will not sorry uh

1281
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,079
mobile pay will bring on this um but it

1282
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,439
i think that

1283
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,359
hopefully this will equalize a little

1284
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,839
bit our business

1285
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,598
um dealings with this and then the way

1286
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:32,000
that we do it the risk is extremely low

1287
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,400
because

1288
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,839
like we're just you are actually asking

1289
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,640
us just to fill out a form on your web

1290
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:38,480
page right

1291
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,558
so we can also go with a very fairly low

1292
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,480
margin on each payment because the risk

1293
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,280
is fairly low for us

1294
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,640
and i think that is the pure advantage

1295
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,160
of these apis is that

1296
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,839
because you're doing you're relying on

1297
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,279
an existing infrastructure payment

1298
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,558
infrastructure that is extremely cheap

1299
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,000
to run

1300
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:57,280
then that should be also reflected

1301
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,599
throughout the chain and also to the

1302
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:05,839
consumer and that was i think the basic

1303
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,839
idea of this

1304
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:12,160
yeah i think the questions ran out but

1305
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,680
thank you very much for the questions it

1306
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,078
also was very nice that you gave me

1307
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,720
15 minutes extra talk on so thank you

1308
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,160
and please come

1309
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,160
with me if you have any questions about

1310
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:26,400
[Laughter]

1311
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:29,839
this
