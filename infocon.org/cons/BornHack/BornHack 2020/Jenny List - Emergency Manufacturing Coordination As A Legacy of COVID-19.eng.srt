aren't we and uh it's really great

6
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,720
actually to be at a hacker camp

7
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,000
uh and i want to um before i start i

8
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,039
want to thank

9
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
the bourne hack team for for putting

10
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,440
this on

11
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,960
in such a difficult year and going

12
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,840
through all the difficult stuff with the

13
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,638
authorities and whatever

14
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,318
and i for one really appreciate the

15
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,919
efforts gone into this camp and i am

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,080
very very pleased to be here and it's

17
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,039
lovely to see you all again

18
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
um right anyway um my name is jenny list

19
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,318
i

20
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,039
write for hackaday.com i'm also a member

21
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,639
of

22
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,560
oxford hackspace and milton keynes

23
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,880
makerspace in the uk

24
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,599
um and this talk it's about um

25
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,280
what happened in the hackspace community

26
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,280
around the pandemic

27
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,198
and you know what what we can learn from

28
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,880
it and what how we might go forward from

29
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,840
what we've learned in the future

30
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,840
so yeah 2020

31
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,639
it seems difficult to believe that um

32
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,080
where are we august

33
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,840
sort of seven or eight months ago

34
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,440
none of this had happened you know can

35
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
you imagine what 2020 would have been

36
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,560
like

37
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,119
if we just had a normal year you know

38
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,319
it's

39
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,479
we'd i mean i'd have been to emf for one

40
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,319
but uh it seems as though an entire

41
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,520
decade has passed in

42
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:56,720
seven or eight months uh it's certainly

43
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,719
uh i think it's taxed all of us uh

44
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,840
anyway

45
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,000
probably most of you are aware

46
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,119
that uh governments were caught on the

47
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,599
hop by

48
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,960
uh covered 19. i'm talking from a

49
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,000
british perspective

50
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,758
so uh maybe the danish government

51
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
had it completely in hand i don't know

52
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,280
maybe other governments did

53
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
but certainly for us there were enormous

54
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,840
shortages of ppe personal protective

55
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,919
equipment

56
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,840
the government had really messed up

57
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,359
there wasn't enough there were doctors

58
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,039
going without and having to treat

59
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,599
patients there were people in

60
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,719
care homes in particular who just could

61
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,120
not get hold of it

62
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,640
excuse me i just have to plug my laptop

63
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,640
because the cable has fallen out

64
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,199
and this really became a bit of a

65
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
national scandal

66
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,560
because effectively people died because

67
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,480
of it

68
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,239
and obviously in the hackerspace

69
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,519
makerspace community

70
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:57,920
we we responded we responded as

71
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:02,320
only we can we make stuff so we made

72
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,240
vast amounts of homemade ppe

73
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,680
and that's hacker space communities

74
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,920
maker space communities

75
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,920
sewing communities textile communities

76
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,680
all sorts of people who make things

77
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,519
uh did everything laser cuts

78
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,439
face visors um the thing i printed was

79
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,720
the ear savers those little spiky things

80
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
that go around the back of your

81
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,080
um head i printed hundreds of those

82
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,560
things

83
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,519
uh you know there were people making

84
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,800
scrubs

85
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,240
and scrub caps and i don't think they

86
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,240
were making gowns i think gowns are

87
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,760
something special for surgery

88
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,000
but they can make the scrubs for just

89
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,839
wearing in the ward and stuff

90
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,360
and it was a huge effort

91
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,000
and it i think it was quite successful

92
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,640
certainly

93
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,720
the recipients i saw they were so

94
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,720
desperate and they were so bold over

95
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,600
that just random members of the public

96
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,120
were rising up to help them i remember a

97
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,839
conversation a friend of mine had where

98
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,079
she got through to the supply department

99
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,360
and they went through all the stuff

100
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,000
about what they were offering what the

101
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,680
spec was

102
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,839
and all that kind of stuff and then she

103
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,160
gets to the end and the supplies go well

104
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
okay well send your bill to whichever

105
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,120
the thing

106
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,560
and my friend said no no this is free

107
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,959
we're making this and donating it

108
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,518
there was a long silence you know i

109
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,319
think the the healthcare community

110
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,440
were really rather bold over by it um in

111
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,160
the uk

112
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,839
it was all on a fairly local basis so

113
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,439
for instance we were dealing with our

114
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,760
local hospital in oxford

115
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,279
uh we were dealing in milton keynes it

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,680
was actually one of the

117
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,640
the doctors practices are all there's a

118
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,839
bunch of them all

119
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,240
under one one sort of overarching

120
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,600
administration and one of their doctors

121
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,279
approached us

122
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,560
and we coordinated it through him so we

123
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,200
supplied a lot of face shields and

124
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,319
things

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,560
to um a lot of the doctor's surgeries

126
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,600
around milton keynes

127
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,000
um the picture there it's from

128
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,000
uh my mk makerspace friend christoph

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,340
that's actually packaged up

130
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,200
uh

131
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,440
[Music]

132
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,800
face shield bands they're 3d printed and

133
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,320
you hang a cut

134
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,160
sheet of um acrylic is it i can't

135
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,760
one of the plastics off the front to

136
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,760
make the face shield and those are

137
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,680
bagged up i think in there there is this

138
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,600
all sanitized and i think you know

139
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
there's also one of the airsaver bands

140
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,839
as well

141
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,199
and i don't know how many we supplied

142
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,920
but it was certainly in the

143
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,480
significant number of thousands you had

144
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,560
everybody in mk who owned a 3d printer

145
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,600
was banging out these things at home

146
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:42,079
continuously for about a month or more

147
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,560
so it's a hell of a lot of stuff um the

148
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,120
thing is

149
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,920
what did we how did we do and what did

150
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,959
we learn

151
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,599
um i mean our strength

152
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,279
in the hacker and make space communities

153
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,720
and associated communities is

154
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,600
we can make almost anything i mean

155
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,480
it's it's kind of weird because we take

156
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,399
it for granted

157
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,839
that you know if you want something

158
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,959
within reason

159
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,480
you can make something i mean people

160
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,680
associated with our communities make

161
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,000
everything from

162
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
sort of satellites people are making

163
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,360
silicon chips

164
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,800
people are making things you used to

165
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,920
need

166
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,439
rocket budgets to to pay for and

167
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,319
there's nothing in our community we

168
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,839
can't make so that was our strength

169
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,600
where it doesn't work quite so well is

170
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,320
we don't manufacture well

171
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,839
we can make stuff but manufacturing

172
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,959
we're not really geared up for it

173
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,720
um so friends here's me making uh the

174
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,560
the bands around the back of the neck

175
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,200
that's actually quite a simple one-piece

176
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,439
piece of plastic if i was gearing up a

177
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,079
factory to do it i would probably i'm

178
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,240
guessing

179
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,839
an injection mold or something i'm an

180
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,720
electronic engineer not a production

181
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,720
engineer but

182
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,560
i would guess i'd injection mold and i

183
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,079
would be turning them out sort of

184
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,119
once a second or whatever but i was 3d

185
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,199
printing them

186
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,279
it took my creality ender 3 pro about

187
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
an hour and 45 minutes to print five of

188
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
them

189
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,079
and running all day i printed an

190
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,719
impressive amount

191
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,279
the fact is what we needed at the time

192
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,920
was

193
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,320
simply we just needed them to be made

194
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
and

195
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,360
it wasn't the quickest way to make them

196
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,800
but it was the only way we could make

197
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,279
them so we made them

198
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,880
but under no circumstances is it what

199
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,519
you call a an efficient

200
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,480
way to do it so while we're good at

201
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,480
making stuff

202
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,160
we're not there's a difference between

203
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,519
making and manufacturing

204
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,959
uh and it's something we've got to

205
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,000
understand we're also have a huge

206
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,518
culture of individuality so everybody

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,360
goes their own way everybody i am the

208
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,480
genius engineer i know this you know i

209
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,399
can do this

210
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680
and so we had a lot of duplicated effort

211
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,880
i know there were quite a lot of

212
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,560
different

213
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,480
very similar designs for

214
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,319
masks or whatever other thing people

215
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,320
were making some of them were better

216
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,680
than others

217
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,279
some people despite that one is better

218
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,079
i'm sticking with this one because i

219
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,439
designed it

220
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,120
that kind of there were a lot of sort of

221
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,959
turf wars and stuff

222
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,519
and a lot of the same ground was gone

223
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,279
over

224
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,480
by more than one group i mean it's

225
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,639
inevitable when you've got a group of

226
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,240
district people this is going to happen

227
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,199
um there are also many duplicated forms

228
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,720
of communication

229
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,680
i mean there was all you use all slacks

230
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,040
and signals and facebooks and god knows

231
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,800
what else telegram

232
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,560
whatsapp and they were all different

233
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,839
things and i had friends

234
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,319
who were they were

235
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
worn out because they were constantly

236
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
following about

237
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,279
six or seven different forums and

238
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,279
conversations basically going over the

239
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,279
same topics but different people

240
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,120
oh i'm on that whatsapp group i'm not on

241
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,839
the signal group or the slack group or

242
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,920
whatever

243
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,680
and you know oh i'm with that lot we're

244
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,399
on this we're not going in with you on

245
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,839
that

246
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,480
and it

247
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,560
sapped energy from people who should

248
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,399
have been coordinating making stuff just

249
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,518
dealing with all the communication

250
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:10,720
so that we could learn from that

251
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:14,320
um there was a lot of

252
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,320
effort that was put into work that was

253
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,480
very well intentioned but not entirely

254
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,319
useful

255
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,160
so for instance one of the big things

256
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,040
early in the pandemic was that we would

257
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,800
need millions of ventilators

258
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,639
and a lot of hackers said okay i'm going

259
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
to design a ventilator

260
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,800
and i think any of us could design a

261
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,519
ventilator i could design a ventilator

262
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,880
it might even be a ventilator that works

263
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,639
but the trouble is when you're hooking

264
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,079
somebody up to a ventilator

265
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,680
you're actually on a machine that's

266
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,638
keeping them alive

267
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,560
now i can make things would you trust me

268
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,560
to stick a tube in you to keep you alive

269
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,040
to make a ventilator i'm just using

270
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
ventilator as an example but there were

271
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,439
other

272
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
other items of ppe and medical stuff to

273
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
make a ventilator

274
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,959
you design it and you design it with the

275
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,240
best possible engineers and materials

276
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,680
and everything in the knowledge the

277
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,160
doctors that you can

278
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
and then you send it off i don't know

279
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,079
how it works because i'm not in that

280
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,599
industry

281
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,800
but there will be a lot of medical

282
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,480
trials and labs and tests and

283
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,880
everything there will be things i can't

284
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,680
even imagine as an electronic engineer

285
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
and it probably takes a lot of dollars

286
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,758
and

287
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,360
quite a lot of time before you get a

288
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,120
stamp on it that says

289
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,959
you can sell this to hospitals and they

290
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,440
can plug patients into it

291
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,279
but there were hackers coming up with

292
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,959
some really really clever

293
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,560
ventilators that would have done a

294
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,279
really good job and

295
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,880
some downright lethal ideas this will

296
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,040
work as a ventilator

297
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,079
i mean i'm not going to go into details

298
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,719
but there were

299
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,519
ones where that will poison the patient

300
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,399
that will

301
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,160
uh give them an infection that will not

302
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,639
give them enough oxygen all these kind

303
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,639
of things

304
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,759
and a lot of effort was being put into

305
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,120
that and that effort should have been

306
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,399
put into stuff that would have

307
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,120
actually helped uh and so that's one of

308
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,639
the things we

309
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,199
that's another thing we can learn then

310
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,559
i'm afraid there were some egos involved

311
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,400
i mean if you were involved in

312
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,319
the ppe thing you'll have had you know

313
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,919
different groups and we're not talking

314
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,438
to that group we're in competition with

315
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,120
that group we're

316
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,480
you know we're the only ones who do this

317
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,319
we're the other ones do that and they

318
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,480
were probably in the uk they're about

319
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,839
various different groupings doing things

320
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,760
and you were either with them or with

321
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,720
them and that lot didn't talk to them

322
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,000
and stone

323
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,840
and i hope i am not

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,760
going to annoy anybody by saying this

325
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,360
but yes it happened

326
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,799
and fortunately in mk we managed to

327
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,360
stay out of it we were dealing with our

328
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,639
local gp surgeries and we just got on

329
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,320
with it

330
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,200
and so it went well for us but i know in

331
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,200
some places it

332
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
they were more interested in who was

333
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,520
doing it you know going after sort of

334
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,039
the glory than they were in just getting

335
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,080
the damn things into the hands of the

336
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,760
medical people

337
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,360
um and finally

338
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,640
funding and supply chains became

339
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,639
saturated um

340
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,720
i didn't never counted them but at one

341
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,479
point there were loads and loads of

342
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,799
different crowdfunders so and so is

343
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,080
doing this so-and-so is doing that

344
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,320
and they're all basically doing the same

345
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,120
thing but somebody's going to give

346
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,639
to the crowdfunder in mk they're not

347
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,080
going to give to the one in luton

348
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,679
or in oxford or wherever it became the

349
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,120
point where

350
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,320
nobody would make any money from a

351
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,799
crowdfunder because there were just so

352
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,120
many of them and

353
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,160
that i think that's held people back

354
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,439
there were certainly some

355
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,640
groups i saw that were desperately

356
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,760
trying to make this stuff but basically

357
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,520
ran out of money

358
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,120
and you can't expect something like this

359
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,240
to be on the personal resources of the

360
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,918
people involved

361
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,799
because ultimately we're all charitable

362
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
but the fact is somebody can't basically

363
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,679
spend all their savings on something

364
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,639
like this it's not fair

365
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,080
and particularly when they're putting in

366
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,360
the amount of time that was put in by

367
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,399
quite a lot of them

368
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,159
and also supply chains became exhausted

369
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,840
there was a point where suddenly you

370
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,200
could not get your hands

371
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,480
on pet g

372
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,320
filament for love nor money and i think

373
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,120
the price on pla

374
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,399
and pet g went right up uh and i believe

375
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,719
it hasn't come down

376
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,919
i may be wrong but i seem to remember it

377
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,480
was beforehand

378
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,320
in the before time it was about 15 quid

379
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,640
a kilogram on amazon for a

380
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,480
just normal roll of pla and i think it's

381
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,120
somewhere above 20 quid now about 20

382
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
quid

383
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,399
i haven't bought one but certainly last

384
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,559
time i looked it was about

385
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,160
that kind of ballpark and there was a

386
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,280
period where you just couldn't get it

387
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,480
uh so and i know people were

388
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,160
turning the place over to find um

389
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,400
was it acrylic sheets this the

390
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,559
see-through sheet for the um

391
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
visors there were there were problems

392
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,480
because everybody was after the same

393
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,480
thing

394
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
excuse me so

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,559
now that the industrial supply

396
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,639
and the healthcare supply has kicked in

397
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,639
to a greater or lesser extent

398
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,480
unfortunately in the uk

399
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,919
as is the won't of the uk governments

400
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
they maybe didn't do the best job they

401
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,880
should have done they

402
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,879
decreed from on high that uh

403
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,719
ppa made by non-recognized manufacturers

404
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,400
could not be used because it wasn't

405
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,679
didn't have the right certifications and

406
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,320
all that kind of stuff despite the fact

407
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,679
we had

408
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,360
the certifications for the things we

409
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,080
were putting in i can't read the exact

410
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,399
rule but there was some rule they put in

411
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,158
uh just and they they did that so we

412
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,000
suddenly had to basically stop

413
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,159
but unfortunately they didn't have the

414
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,559
supplies to supply the people

415
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,559
so we stopped because we would be

416
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,600
prosecuted otherwise

417
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,600
and meanwhile the um

418
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,199
nurses and whatever were desperate for

419
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,480
ppe the care homes

420
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,240
the old people's homes they were

421
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
basically just left to deal with it with

422
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,600
nothing

423
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,720
and i remember you know there was a

424
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
period where these people were

425
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,360
desperately ringing because they were

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,640
trying to get hold of it

427
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,678
i'm told that there were even people who

428
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,880
sort of didn't supply ppe but it was oh

429
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,080
i've left some ppe over there and

430
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,440
that's not a way to go forward

431
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,960
i don't think they handled that very

432
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,919
well i mean it's a political point about

433
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,240
the british government

434
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,000
but if they could do something

435
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
differently it would be

436
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,120
make sure when they stop the small

437
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,199
makers making the stuff make sure

438
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,360
they've got some to supply themselves

439
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,440
if you want to google the british

440
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,360
approach to sourcing ppe there is a nice

441
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,159
juicy political scandals brewing in

442
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,918
there

443
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,679
um but as a community now it's over

444
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,280
well now it's now we're no longer making

445
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,919
the large large amounts

446
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,360
i think we can be proud of what we did

447
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,960
um

448
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,120
it's a dangerous trait in british

449
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,919
societies to use second world war

450
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,719
metaphors

451
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,480
but i think we can say that as a maker

452
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,400
community it was our finest hour

453
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,360
we did help we gave stuff to healthcare

454
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,080
people

455
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,840
i am obviously talking from a british

456
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,120
perspective here but as far as i know

457
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,840
the same thing happened in other

458
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,280
countries

459
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,480
i've heard it happened in france i know

460
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,639
it happened to a certain extent in the

461
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,360
netherlands

462
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,840
i presume a similar effort went underway

463
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
in

464
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,879
denmark not having been there at the

465
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,480
time i can't

466
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,919
obviously comment on that but i know it

467
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,600
was quite a lot of places around the

468
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,320
world

469
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,639
we made a difference and i'm i think i'm

470
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,678
proud i think we can all be proud

471
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
of what we did there um

472
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,720
we also gained a valuable skill and

473
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,080
experience none of us had ever done

474
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,320
anything like this before and we

475
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,799
effectively learned how to become

476
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,158
small-scale manufacturers how to become

477
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
inefficient and not very good

478
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,120
small-scale manufacturers but we learned

479
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,959
a lot we learned a lot about

480
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,600
certification of stuff we learned a lot

481
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,919
about how to prepare a product so

482
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
you saw those visors were bagged up and

483
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,440
sterilized we learned a lot about

484
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,559
making effectively a production line to

485
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,880
do that

486
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,879
uh

487
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,240
and the thing is that's all we learned

488
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,440
that's all been sort of knowledge that

489
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,960
has been acquired

490
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,400
and we need to hang on to that we need

491
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,960
to say okay how could we do it better

492
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,760
if it happened again and how can we hang

493
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,440
on for that

494
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,200
and how can we use it again in the

495
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,080
future which really comes to the purpose

496
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,600
of this talk

497
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,399
um i'm going to take you back in history

498
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,760
now

499
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,280
now i'm told there isn't an equivalent

500
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,400
of this in denmark

501
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,080
but there is in most other countries

502
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,480
um in 1953 there was a freak flood

503
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,199
in the north sea i believe it was a

504
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,520
storm

505
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,080
coupled with a particular tidal uh

506
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,679
condition that caused all the water to

507
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,039
sort of flood down into the southern

508
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,120
north sea

509
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,158
and there was widespread flooding in the

510
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,760
east of england

511
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,720
from sort of east anglia not norfolk

512
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,440
down to essex and there was also

513
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,600
flooding

514
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,080
in the western netherlands this picture

515
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,760
here is an archive picture from sealand

516
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,678
the bottom left-hand corner of the

517
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,840
netherlands

518
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,960
i know that there were significant

519
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,320
deaths

520
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,240
in the low-lying eastern english

521
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,720
regions and it was a major disaster

522
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,799
at the time i know that the floods

523
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,120
knocked out a lot of the communications

524
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,158
so the telephone system was pretty

525
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,399
antiquated

526
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,400
in the uk at the time and it had been

527
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,520
hit hard by the war certainly and

528
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,760
uh when it was knocked out the police

529
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,158
didn't have any way of coordinating

530
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,799
and so they resorted to radio amateurs

531
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,720
uh

532
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,320
and this isn't sort of your modern radio

533
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,080
amateur where they're little digital

534
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,080
chinese handheld this is you know

535
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,639
old-fashioned morse code kind of

536
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,480
uh hf shortwave radio amateurs and the

537
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,600
radio amateurs

538
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,600
did a very good job and afterwards they

539
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,279
came together as look we learned how to

540
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,879
do something here this might happen

541
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,400
again let's hang on to that

542
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,559
and they formed a thing called raynette

543
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,960
now rayner is i think it's radio amateur

544
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,799
emergency network or something like that

545
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,400
and they train for

546
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,840
disaster uh operations i mean you'll see

547
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,919
them doing you know sort of

548
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,158
communications for fun runs and all

549
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,039
sorts of mundane things there's training

550
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,400
exercises

551
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,158
but they're there for in case something

552
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,760
like that happens again it's a model

553
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,440
that has been exported all around the

554
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,480
world since 1953

555
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,080
so for instance the puerto rican

556
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,880
earthquake i believe the american

557
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,120
equivalent

558
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,480
was helping there and every now and then

559
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,479
when there's an actual disaster a

560
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,440
volcano or a hurricane or something like

561
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,720
that

562
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,480
actually no it wasn't an earthquake in

563
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,760
puerto rico it was a hurricane yes when

564
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
there's a hurricane or volcano or

565
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,080
something

566
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,240
you'll see a bulletin stay off this

567
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,439
frequency they're using it for

568
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,720
emergency work and so it's a very

569
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,440
successful model of we learned something

570
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,400
from this

571
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,200
let's hang on to that and build it and

572
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,480
it's

573
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:05,840
here we are 70 years later nearly

574
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,960
and it's still going strong

575
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,360
and is all over the world ready to take

576
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,840
up

577
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,039
i'm told the reason denmark have one is

578
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,320
that the danish government

579
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,760
have said you don't need this our radio

580
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
communication system

581
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,840
is strong enough to withstand anything

582
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,000
to which my response is what could

583
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,959
possibly go wrong but i am not a dane so

584
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,960
i cannot really comment

585
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
um

586
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,960
so i'm sort of sitting here thinking you

587
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,039
know how do we how do we hang on to this

588
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,480
do how do we sort of keep this going how

589
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,120
do we do a raynette

590
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,799
and i came up with a few sort of things

591
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,439
of you know what would we want to do

592
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,960
from this

593
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,720
and i'm going to read them out to bring

594
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,559
the flexibility and school

595
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,159
small-scale manufacturing strength of

596
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,678
the hakka maker communities together

597
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,039
where necessary in response to

598
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,679
emergencies in other words

599
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,080
to be able to do this again to retain

600
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,960
that

601
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,720
ability and then to provide organized

602
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,640
hacker maker support to events

603
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,400
communities and community projects by

604
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,279
way of training and preparation

605
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,799
so that means have an organized group

606
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,360
analogous to raynette

607
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,879
where i am part of the let's say hacker

608
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,678
emergency response whatever you want to

609
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
call it

610
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,120
and i know that we're going to come

611
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,399
together and

612
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,879
let's say we're going to do something as

613
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,199
a group

614
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,559
training exercise as part of i know

615
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,840
setting up a hacker camp

616
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:32,240
or doing something for a

617
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,039
community group or whatever things we

618
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,279
can find

619
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,080
to help keep those skills of working as

620
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,279
a team

621
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,120
of making things to keep them active

622
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,399
so if there was another emergency or

623
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,320
another pandemic

624
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,918
we know we're already a team we can just

625
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,720
spring into action right we know what

626
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,240
we're doing

627
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,440
here's the thing we're making here is

628
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,640
the thing we're doing we're just going

629
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,240
to get on with it

630
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,600
and it would be nice to think just as

631
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,360
rainettes have become part of the

632
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,600
amateur radio scenery

633
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,639
that such a thing might become part of

634
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,000
the um

635
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,440
hacker maker scenery and

636
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,200
the last one to bring together the

637
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,799
ingenuity and curiosity of our

638
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,520
communities to create ready-to-go

639
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,520
solutions

640
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,039
to likely emergent problems which

641
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,918
basically means

642
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,399
a lot of our time was spent designing

643
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,159
the

644
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,719
uh face shields the masks the the

645
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,760
bands whatever we were making and there

646
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,600
are some things

647
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,240
where if we had some likely scenarios

648
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,840
things we knew might well happen

649
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,679
we could then try to design things and

650
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,600
have designs ready to go

651
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,200
so in the case of a pandemic okay we've

652
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,799
had the experience with a pandemic

653
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,399
in the case of pandemic we might say

654
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,399
right here is the

655
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,439
face shield that we are best able to

656
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,479
build

657
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,720
let's make sure we have enough knowledge

658
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,960
ability and even materials in hand to

659
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,240
make some of these if we need to

660
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,760
um and i'm sure that you know there

661
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
could be a lot of brainstorming about

662
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,480
what

663
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
in-house knowledge and designs would

664
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,919
needs to be socked away

665
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,520
but i'm sure that our community could

666
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,520
come up with a plan

667
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,279
so that you know a flood has happened

668
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
here is what they're likely to need here

669
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,720
are the designs let's get making that

670
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,720
kind of thing

671
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,440
um what are we not here to do now

672
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,559
this is a hackaday piece i wrote a few

673
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,399
years ago

674
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,678
uh and it was actually it was in

675
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,479
response to

676
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,000
uh spending a night in a hotel room and

677
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,559
the hotel was full and i was actually

678
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,919
given the adapted room for people with a

679
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,600
disability

680
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,799
and of course you're lying there and

681
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,520
you're looking at the different features

682
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,120
of the room

683
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,200
and you realize oh well they haven't

684
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,799
done a very good job there

685
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,039
you know this this feature hasn't been

686
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,039
very well implemented i am an engineer i

687
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,120
could fix it and you're imagining how

688
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,399
you know i would design it like that

689
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,239
and then at which point you think hang

690
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,279
on i have fallen into a trap

691
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,159
i have fallen into the engineer savior

692
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,679
trap

693
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:58,000
where it's i am an engineer i can go in

694
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,399
and sort out the problems of somebody

695
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,159
less

696
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,678
fortunate than myself and this

697
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,159
overwhelming smugness

698
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,840
takes you over i am such a good person

699
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,360
and of course what you're actually doing

700
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,918
is you're muscling in on somebody else's

701
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,279
knowledge

702
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:16,880
and applying your own ideas

703
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:18,720
rather than either

704
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,640
listening to them and fixing the

705
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,840
problems they want fixing

706
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:27,200
or helping them to fix their problems

707
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,760
their way or just standing back

708
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,840
and letting them talk and speak

709
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,840
effectively or speaking over people

710
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,840
so in this case by emergency response

711
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,520
i'm looking at this and i'm thinking

712
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,600
this if if this were to happen in our

713
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,480
communities it needs to be something for

714
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,879
our emergencies it needs to be something

715
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,039
for

716
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,440
emergencies that affect us so things

717
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,039
like the 1953 flood things like the

718
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,679
covid19

719
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,720
it shouldn't be we're here to fix the

720
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,200
emergencies of

721
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,480
say a family in a developing country or

722
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,279
something like that

723
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,240
we all want to help our best bet to help

724
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,360
something like that

725
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,760
is to donate to agencies that do it the

726
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,799
right way don't go in as a white savior

727
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,440
and who work with the people concerned

728
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,480
if you want to do hands-on stuff as an

729
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,640
engineer

730
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,559
or a hacker maker to do that kind of

731
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,519
thing there are even organizations you

732
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,120
can join i believe

733
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,120
engineers without borders is an

734
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,760
organization uh

735
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,559
this idea that i'm talking about is not

736
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,919
there

737
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,240
to become the engineer

738
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,960
savior it's there to provide solutions

739
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,320
for things that

740
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,960
affect our communities

741
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,840
you know there are other ways to achieve

742
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,960
help

743
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,399
for disasters in other parts of the

744
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,020
world or to other

745
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,639
people

746
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:54,080
[Music]

747
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,799
so how would you do this now i'm not

748
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,559
setting myself up as somebody who's

749
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,399
going to do this i'm also not setting

750
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,399
myself up as a guru on this

751
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,200
i worry that you're going to get people

752
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,879
saying oh i single-handedly saved

753
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,240
the health service with all the work i

754
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,240
did i didn't

755
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,440
save the health service i was a very

756
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,200
very small cog

757
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,360
in somebody else's machine and this is

758
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,440
my observations of what happened

759
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,879
but it's not my expertise as the person

760
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,799
who saved the world

761
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,279
it's a case i sat there printing these

762
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,519
ear things these earsaver thingies

763
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,120
and i was observing people so this is

764
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,880
very much my

765
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,760
personal sort of how would i like to see

766
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,240
this done and

767
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,360
the idea is to to set people thinking

768
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,840
and see if anybody

769
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,120
takes the bait and takes this kind of

770
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,320
idea forward

771
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,199
so use rain net as a model um rain

772
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,200
networks

773
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,039
see how rain networks see how it is

774
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,159
organized and

775
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,720
shamelessly copy it if it works don't

776
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,919
reinvent it

777
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,240
i'm guessing something like this would

778
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,360
have to be an entity something like a

779
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,279
charity or

780
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,559
non-profit company or something i don't

781
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,919
know how these things work

782
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,760
but you'd probably need something for

783
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,919
legal liability

784
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,200
i would say very clearly a national

785
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,320
organization rather than an

786
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,880
international one

787
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,120
because herding cats sorry herding

788
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,000
hackers is bad enough locally

789
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,840
herding hackers internationally would be

790
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,760
an absolute disaster

791
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,039
um the advantage you get from this is

792
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,840
centralization

793
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:34,000
of all the things that were duplicated

794
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,039
so i put funding channels here so

795
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,399
instead of 50

796
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,679
50 or 60 hundreds uh crowdfunders have

797
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,879
one funding appeal have one clear

798
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,120
message

799
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,720
have one set of relationships with

800
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,760
sponsors because you're a big

801
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,320
organization

802
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,158
you can attract big sponsors you can

803
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,439
talk to the right people you know there

804
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,200
are people who know what they're doing

805
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,240
with that the people i i probably

806
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,679
wouldn't know how to approach the

807
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,519
sponsor but i guarantee you there will

808
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:04,000
be people who could

809
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:06,799
um and similarly the certification and

810
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,079
design stuff certification is a hardcore

811
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,800
thing it's something i know nothing

812
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,560
about

813
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,839
but yet again in our community there are

814
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,918
people who know this

815
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:15,918
why have lots of little hackerspaces

816
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,279
struggling with certification

817
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,480
where somewhere in our community there's

818
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,960
probably somebody who is a medical

819
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,240
engineer and does it for a living

820
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,119
this is why centralization you

821
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,799
you access so much broader array of

822
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,639
resources

823
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,639
um and

824
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,639
finally similar to what raynette do when

825
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,560
they are doing

826
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,480
the radio communications for a fun run

827
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,000
or a village fate or whatever

828
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,399
is do manufacturing runs okay you want a

829
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,040
set of expertise in making face shields

830
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,598
make some face shields and if you do

831
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,199
that

832
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,560
you probably also end up with a bit of a

833
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,239
stock of face shield so if there's

834
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,480
another medical disaster

835
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,078
then hey you can start handing them out

836
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,640
straight away you don't have to get up

837
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,640
and running

838
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,520
as i say i think probably the best way

839
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,320
to hang on to this knowledge is to

840
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,720
practice

841
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,680
and so our community would have to come

842
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,799
up with some way

843
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,399
of practicing becoming

844
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:20,560
a well-oiled team and

845
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,560
using that to hold on to the knowledge

846
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,119
a local level you know all our maker

847
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:28,960
spaces

848
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,000
um we have to think

849
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,160
you know how could we have done this

850
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,320
better how could we made stuff quicker

851
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,359
and yes we've all got 3d printers and

852
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
laser cutters

853
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,640
and we did a good job with those but

854
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,400
there are other things

855
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,720
so for instance um i was thinking

856
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,599
wouldn't it be great if we had injection

857
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,520
molding

858
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,119
and there will be other things which i

859
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,359
haven't thought of which could

860
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,720
similarly have made it so much easier

861
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,640
you know if milton keynes makes space

862
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,279
had an injection molding machine for

863
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,400
those

864
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,040
um ear savers instead of turning out

865
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,480
five

866
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,720
every nearly two hours i could probably

867
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,680
turn out five in five minutes

868
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,399
i don't i'm not a a skilled in injection

869
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,919
molding

870
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,079
but i'm guessing industrial injection

871
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,839
moldings probably turn out 500 in five

872
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,320
minutes but

873
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,320
that's a bit optimistic um

874
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,200
we would it it would be makes sense for

875
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,920
us to think

876
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,799
how can we extend our capabilities to do

877
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,320
more stuff

878
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,760
and this is good beyond this it's not

879
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
just that we might make some face

880
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,920
shields

881
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,440
i don't know about you but i'd quite

882
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,720
like my hackerspace to have an injection

883
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,079
molding machine

884
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,240
there's all sorts of cool things i can

885
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,880
do with that um

886
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,040
we also need to embrace uh emergency

887
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,200
manufacturing as part of our culture

888
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,640
in the same way that radio amateurs have

889
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,680
embraced raynette

890
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,279
um raynette is just part of amateur

891
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,520
radio it's one of the many different

892
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,280
facets of amateur radio and you know if

893
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,320
you know radiometers they'll be the guys

894
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,079
that do

895
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,079
home brew radios they'll be the guys

896
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,640
that do shortwave dx they'll all be the

897
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,480
morse enthusiasts the satellite people

898
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,680
and there will be the people rayner is

899
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,839
their thing

900
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,839
and we all know what reyna is and

901
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,040
we recognize it as this is part of what

902
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,359
radio amateurs do

903
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,160
and similarly we could

904
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,598
embrace emergency manufacturer as part

905
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,879
of hackerspace culture

906
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,520
hackerspaces squabble a lot we 3d print

907
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,160
things

908
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,079
we laser cut but we also do emergency

909
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,640
manufacture when there is a pandemic or

910
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,599
another

911
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,160
disaster and that would be easy to

912
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,880
embrace

913
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,799
the great thing is this is a wonderful

914
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,040
uh

915
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,440
public relations thing um we can

916
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,960
say i mean the milton keys make space in

917
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,000
the future when we're after grants or

918
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,000
whatever we'll be saying

919
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
look we did this during the pandemic we

920
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,640
supplied stuff to the doctors

921
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,560
and we need to proselytize we need to

922
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,319
tell people

923
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,920
you've heard of hackers you think we're

924
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,040
hacker space you probably think we're

925
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,119
computer criminals

926
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,119
this is what we actually did and they go

927
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:12,160
oh wow that's quite something

928
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,760
we should make more of what we do

929
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,839
sometimes we're a bit quiet and sort of

930
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,040
geeky about stuff but we can be proud of

931
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,640
this we should tell people

932
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,960
and that's it i don't know whether this

933
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,160
talk or others like it i'm told there's

934
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,000
a guy in france has

935
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,520
been saying similar things at one of

936
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
their events

937
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,920
um i don't know whether it will sort of

938
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,839
start a spark

939
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,760
um but i believe that

940
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,960
we have come up with something valuable

941
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,359
here

942
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,920
and it could become something special

943
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:49,759
and i do hope that somewhere out there

944
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,800
there will be people who agree with me

945
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,800
um anyway yes i've been jenny list you

946
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,640
can find me twitter jenny alto

947
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,480
or if you go to hackaday you can find

948
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,790
all the wonderful things i have written

949
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,869
thank you very much

950
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,869
[Applause]

951
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,160
now do any of you have any questions

952
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,839
hello

953
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,119
motivating part of it seeing that some

954
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,800
yeah it's what's my experience of the

955
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,000
reaction of the recipients

956
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,480
and in particular have they

957
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,119
responded to seeing people actually

958
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,040
coming out

959
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,720
and supporting them is that right yeah

960
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,480
yeah well

961
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,439
i know that certainly the people i

962
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,119
dealt with were very very very pleased

963
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,800
indeed to have some people who were

964
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,119
actually helping them

965
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,839
there were desperate measures being

966
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,800
taken

967
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,759
uh it went to the rounds on social media

968
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,800
that there was

969
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,640
a an online shop that was a

970
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,160
that's not safe for work hey we're a

971
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,839
daytime talk here but there was an

972
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,359
online shop that was specialist

973
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:35,200
in medical fetish where and

974
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:38,319
uh alongside all the sort of instruments

975
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,319
they also had a stock of scrubs

976
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,400
and they actually got a call from a

977
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,200
major nhs hospital asking to buy all

978
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,560
their scrubs

979
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,480
and what they actually did was said no

980
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,240
don't buy it have it

981
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,920
and they basically penned a very snotty

982
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,959
letter saying look you know you

983
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,200
shouldn't be approaching

984
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,480
you shouldn't have to leave hospitals in

985
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,919
a position where they have to approach

986
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,599
fetish shops to get stuff that the

987
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,560
government should provide

988
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,839
so i know that certainly i mean i

989
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,480
supplied directly

990
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,240
doctor surgeries and old people's home

991
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,040
and they were so

992
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,160
chuffed and they were absolutely bowled

993
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,200
over

994
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,040
that it was we weren't demanding payment

995
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,040
i mean hell we could have made a fortune

996
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,119
we could have written bills you know

997
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,240
like okay there are some scandals at the

998
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,079
moment about

999
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,439
associates of our conservative

1000
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,240
government uh

1001
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,440
having been given multi-million pound

1002
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,919
contracts which

1003
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,520
delivered worthless face masks you know

1004
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,560
we could have written some great bill

1005
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,880
and they would have probably paid it

1006
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,799
they were so desperate but we're not in

1007
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,640
that business we were there to get the

1008
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,119
stuff in the hands of the people

1009
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,480
and they couldn't believe it when they

1010
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,760
happened then when that happened they

1011
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,920
were bowled over

1012
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,960
and that wasn't why you do you don't do

1013
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,839
it to have

1014
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,480
a sort of a nurse pat you on the back or

1015
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,240
something

1016
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,000
you do it to get the stuff but then

1017
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,839
again it was great to see

1018
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,280
that they were that our

1019
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,279
intended customers were pleased with

1020
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,880
what we were doing yeah

1021
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,880
anybody else hello

1022
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:20,319
oh yes

1023
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,400
i didn't encounter that i don't think

1024
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,599
anybody was making something protected

1025
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,880
by ip

1026
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,119
i think the face mask thing

1027
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,960
was i believe it was a joseph prusa

1028
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,560
design was i am i right i think it was a

1029
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,560
joke it started as a joseph proves the

1030
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,359
design and then it was sort of modified

1031
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,920
and made better and iteratively improved

1032
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,480
um

1033
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,520
so obviously joseph perusa had made it

1034
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,119
open source

1035
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,440
i know the thing around the back of my

1036
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,160
neck was open source

1037
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,680
as far as i am aware it was it was some

1038
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,520
hospital researchers

1039
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,960
they needed people they needed those

1040
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,440
valves here and now they didn't

1041
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,520
need a six six week waiting time from

1042
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,760
the states so they just printed them

1043
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,880
their hospital researchers they know

1044
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,280
what they're doing

1045
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,000
hackers and makers probably don't i

1046
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,400
think i

1047
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,680
i may be wrong but i think i'm writing

1048
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,800
remembering that

1049
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,359
the medical devices company got so much

1050
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,160
bad publicity they backed down on it

1051
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:18,240
did they i i'm you would have to google

1052
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,799
that i'm kind of remembering this

1053
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,319
yet again it's it's the whole this six

1054
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,319
months has been a decade long

1055
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,119
but no i was unaware of anything like

1056
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,720
that but it was because we weren't

1057
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,760
going into very ip protected

1058
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,799
uh environments uh i mean pretty much

1059
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,480
everything we were doing you can

1060
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,560
