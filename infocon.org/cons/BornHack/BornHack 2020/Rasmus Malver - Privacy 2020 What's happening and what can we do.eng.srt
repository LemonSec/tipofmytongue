1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
uh

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
before

3
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,840

4
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,840

6
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,039
about

7
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,520
privacy in general terms i'm going to

8
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,360
talk to you about civil liberties

9
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
in general both in what's happening in

10
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
the world and what we're doing in

11
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
denmark

12
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
and then i'm going to come back and talk

13
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,360
about what we're doing in the

14
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,080
organization against illegal data

15
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,080
retention

16
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,919
or foreign mold or logging where we

17
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,120
filed a lawsuit against the

18
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,599
ministry of justice that we are keen on

19
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,360
winning

20
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,199
and changing the world but let's start

21
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,960
at the beginning

22
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,400
i'm arsene melville if you don't know me

23
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,520
i am

24
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,280
i have a law degree and

25
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,039
a former minister of justice has called

26
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,159
me obsessed

27
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,440
so i i wear that as a badge of honor

28
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,000
um and he he's very

29
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,199
i know him from back in the day where he

30
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,639
was a

31
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,280
reasonable guy

32
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,840
and then he got power and he just felt

33
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,559
the urge to hold the ring and to use it

34
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,960
and that wasn't good for him so so he he

35
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,960
doesn't like me anymore

36
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,520
the world we live in right now we're

37
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,680
seeing human rights violations across

38
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,599
the world we have the uyghurs in asia

39
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,360
i specifically chose not to write china

40
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,280
because well that's the problem is it

41
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
china is it not china

42
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,039
black lives matter in america which is

43
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,638
sort of coming out to the world which is

44
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,599
interesting in and of itself

45
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,360
but also it ties in with something i'm

46
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,639
going to come back to we have the lgbt

47
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,639
rights in what we call

48
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,160
eastern europe but that's also a thing

49
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
here i'll come back to that

50
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
palestinians in the middle east that's

51
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
an ongoing problem that we have created

52
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you'll see europe is over represented up

53
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,280
here that's not a coincidence

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
romani or gypsies as people call them

55
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,359
cinti in europe are having a lot of

56
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,199
difficulties at the moment

57
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
because a lot of the sort of what is

58
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,319
called far right but what is

59
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,240
basically racist and nationalist agenda

60
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
they like the gypsies because they're

61
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,800
good scapegoat for everything

62
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
and then we have a ref the refugees in

63
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,160
europe

64
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,639
both between european countries but also

65
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,680
coming

66
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,479
over the mediterranean to europe where

67
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,440
is now

68
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,240
2020 okay for a politician in the

69
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,319
parliament to say yeah let's shoot them

70
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,199
that's what we are today and that's

71
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,199
that's a problem

72
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,400
minorities suffering is business as

73
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,479
usual

74
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,080
and that's what we are a lot of

75
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,639
politicians they like to

76
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,960
grasp onto one of the ones in this list

77
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,000
and say yeah but it's not here

78
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,039
in denmark we just had a massive public

79
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,800
protest against

80
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,159
or in favor of the black lives matter

81
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
movement in america

82
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,840
and all the racists could say was but

83
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,840
that's not here

84
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,479
three of these are in europe and apart

85
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,199
from the weakest

86
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,880
most of this is european made it's a

87
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,000
question about taking responsibility for

88
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,520
what we're doing

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,360
that's also why i am a committed man

90
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,198
i i am obsessed with this because we can

91
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
do something about most of these things

92
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,840
all we have to do is do it

93
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,000
lack of resistance is futile

94
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,318
that's you can do something we have

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,840
danes fighting for black lives matter

96
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,960
and that's all right but what about here

97
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,679
we have had cases of of racist police

98
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
officers

99
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
yet nobody's called a lot of people

100
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,680
calling for a review of the police

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
yet the police themselves are saying no

102
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,199
we don't need that

103
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
we have a labor minister now we started

104
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,520
out with the legal data retention

105
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,039
organization

106
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,120
against the conservative minister of

107
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,199
justice and they are completely on the

108
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
same page both in surveillance but also

109
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,039
in minorities rights

110
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
it's all right for him to say nah the

111
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,080
police are okay

112
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,919
yeah okay we have that one case and that

113
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,719
other case and the third case in the

114
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,479
fourth case

115
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
and we have the ten cases from last week

116
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,719
but there's no need to investigate the

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
danish police

118
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,839
this is the explosive i'm not racist but

119
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,839
but

120
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,399
and i feel we should have that more in

121
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
in general life

122
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
people saying okay it's not that i'm

123
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,600
racist but

124
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,040
why are we talking about black lives

125
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
matter when it's happening across the

126
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,319
world

127
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,040
why are we talking about the weakest

128
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,040
when

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,160
it's in china what are we gonna do we're

130
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
gonna buy our iphones from china anyway

131
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,680
and especially the weakers are

132
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,240
interesting because they're muslim

133
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,599
so yeah there is a point to saying we

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,160
should do something at home

135
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,040
but the people pointing to this fact

136
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,079
usually aren't doing anything at home

137
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,920
so remember the i'm not racist but but

138
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,760
because that's sort of i i feel like

139
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,360
this is a good way to sort of

140
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,439
leave an argument with these kind of

141
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,519
people

142
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,320
lgbt rights in denmark is something i've

143
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,800
fought for myself and and where i've

144
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,080
i've had results and it's something that

145
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,240
i've been talking about

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,160
in the context of surveillance as well

147
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,640
because this is where it starts

148
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,519
in order to violate the rights of a

149
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,360
minority

150
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,360
one needs to know where the minority is

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,320
this is from uh because i've held this

152
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
talk a few times before so i'm gonna

153
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,680
concentrate today on what's happened

154
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,279
since we last saw each other

155
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,239
this is from copenhagen pride and it's

156
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,240
not my best photo

157
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,359
that's a camera mask with several

158
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,199
cameras on it from a police van

159
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,360
this is a place in copenhagen where the

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,640
police chose to take the copenhagen

161
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
pride parade

162
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,959
and narrow where it needed to pass

163
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,760
through so people couldn't walk on the

164
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,319
other side

165
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,079
of a truck people had to walk after the

166
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,959
truck so everybody were

167
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,959
photographed by this

168
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
when we began the legal data retention

169
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,519
the campaign

170
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,599
i said yes but this can be used against

171
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,880
minorities and because i am a member of

172
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,480
the lgbt community

173
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,880
i often use that so i said by checking

174
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,760
our phones they can see if we go to gay

175
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,920
bars

176
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,519
they can see who we're close to how

177
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,439
often we are what we

178
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,880
know what we do but they can sort of get

179
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,160
a general gist of it just from the

180
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,160
metadata

181
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
and then they just sort of turned it up

182
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
and said yeah okay let's do that then

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,760
you don't need to read this this is from

184
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,480
rosa listen

185
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,399
something i was made aware of at the ccc

186
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,560
uh last year and it's online

187
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,959
and you can uh i'm going to tweet it so

188
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,319
go to artworksmelva.com

189
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,640
i'm going to tweet a link or you can

190
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,399
just google osa listen

191
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,760
ccc so the weimar republic which we

192
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,440
often talk about

193
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,160
was the period between the first and the

194
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,079
second world war in germany

195
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,279
and they saw okay fair enough we've lost

196
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,279
this war massively

197
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
and we're gonna need some strong leader

198
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,560
to take us out of this

199
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,640
we better begin counting the minorities

200
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,760
so this is a list of known lgbt people

201
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,240
in germany at the time and people were

202
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,640
saying

203
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,040
don't worry we trust our government

204
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,399
don't worry it's democratically elected

205
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,719
don't worry we have the courts

206
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,680
and then hitler king and they already

207
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,640
had the list

208
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,000
this is the different ones the political

209
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,120
prisoners the

210
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,839
union workers the immigrants the

211
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,800
this one the further one that's

212
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,800
jehovah's witnesses

213
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,600
one shouldn't laugh at the holocaust but

214
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,800
it is still sort of amusing

215
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,480
uh next to that one are the lgbt people

216
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
and they're all locked as homosexual but

217
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,399
obviously we had trans people in it as

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
well

219
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,839
anyone who'd ever had any relationship

220
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,920
then we have

221
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,600
more of this sort of political prisoners

222
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,639
and prisoners from other

223
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,600
armies so we saw this police car

224
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,040
preparing to make this list which could

225
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,760
in the future be used

226
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,439
to imprison us so i got a member of

227
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,720
parliament to ask a question

228
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,880
and this is just there and it's in

229
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,800
danish for you to be able to find it

230
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,279
so this is a absolute reference so you

231
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,160
can see that on the stream

232
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,279
this is the reply the police of

233
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,839
copenhagen

234
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,480
have told parliament that we didn't

235
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,120
position

236
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,880
any cameras but we did have a massive

237
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,120
truck with cameras on it

238
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
spying on them and oh by the way i think

239
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
you didn't mention

240
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
we had a drone

241
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,399
so police were using drones to register

242
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,359
all the participants

243
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,160
in the copenhagen pride parade and this

244
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
is a good case

245
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,000
because even if you are even if you

246
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,040
aren't an lgbt person

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
this is a good canary in the coal mine

248
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,959
and we've gotten a lot of rights

249
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,519
recently we can see we condemn

250
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,359
poland for being anti-lgbt but we're

251
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,320
living in a country where we register

252
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,079
the people who participate in the march

253
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
and the reason this is important is also

254
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,359
because the march is to be out there to

255
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,040
see us

256
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,639
and it's for a lot of people the only

257
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,399
time of year when they can come away

258
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,639
from the tiny village to a place where

259
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,519
they're accepted

260
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,160
but now they know the police are taping

261
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,800
it

262
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,079
and keeping it are they going to come

263
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,519
there again

264
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,439
that's a problem so both before during

265
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,720
and after they're doing this it's a

266
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,839
problem

267
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,240
another case we have is

268
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,600
the drones in themselves are illegal for

269
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
the police to use

270
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,199
and we talked about this on a radio show

271
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,040
as a part of

272
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,680
problem is the law states police cannot

273
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,160
film anything that isn't readily

274
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,800
accessible from street level

275
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,120
thus they cannot use drones they knew

276
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,439
this they told parliament this

277
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,680
then they made a law saying police are

278
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,800
allowed to fly

279
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,040
in city areas and for some people or

280
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,880
for everybody who's not a lawyer that

281
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,920
sounds like now they've been allowed to

282
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,880
fly the drones

283
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,120
and take photos but they haven't they're

284
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,199
now allowed to fly this was all in air

285
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,800
traffic regulation

286
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,719
the air traffic regulation in denmark

287
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,639
now is if you want to fly in a city you

288
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,040
need to if i have a permit first

289
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,880
but you still can't photograph into

290
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,639
people's homes and and things you can't

291
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,720
see from street level

292
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,040
so the law they needed to change was the

293
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,600
one saying the police are never allowed

294
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,360
to film anything they can't readily see

295
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,800
but they didn't change that law because

296
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,199
they knew that would be

297
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,319
an admission of a violation of human

298
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,240
rights

299
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,240
so they change the other one so it seems

300
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,399
like it and that's why we need people

301
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,079
like me

302
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,240
people with a law degree who are sort of

303
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,719
ready to take some of these cases

304
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,480
because when they did it i brought up

305
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,160
the lgbt community and said okay so

306
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
you're gonna be able to photograph where

307
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,959
we are and who we are in the parade

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,959
and two years later they did just that

309
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,199
and they admitted it

310
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,800
this is open information they said yes

311
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,800
we did that and we used the drone

312
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,680
there are reasons to be worried this one

313
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,360
is a screenshot of a danish newspaper

314
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,279
you don't need to know what it says

315
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,759
this is the response when a political

316
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,920
party said why don't we put body cams on

317
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,839
all police officers

318
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,199
and the chairman of the police union

319
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,839
said oh

320
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,599
might as well just abolish the police

321
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,399
you don't believe us

322
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,680
we're no use to you at all i brought

323
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,519
this here because it's interesting

324
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,479
because now we have on one side

325
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,240
the police illegally admitting or

326
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,959
legally admitting to illegally

327
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,360
surveilled the public that's no problem

328
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,839
yeah

329
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,120
we're stopping pedophiles and also and

330
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,480
on the other hand

331
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,920
our access to that information is not

332
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,839
available

333
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,560
i can't go to the police and say can i

334
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:20,639
see the photos you took of me at pride

335
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,479
they don't have to and when we want them

336
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,399
to document what they're doing

337
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,000
especially to minorities

338
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,279
they don't want to and and the fact that

339
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
we're living in this without doing

340
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,800
anything about it is

341
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,079
why i am that is why we need the

342
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,519
activism

343
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,279
so what can we do there are two tracks

344
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,279
that's political and the legal

345
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,199
the political is soft power but it's

346
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,920
it's and it's very easy to sell to

347
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,079
people

348
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,920
like wear a badge i have a lot of

349
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,000
stickers that i make for my own money

350
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,160
which are interesting so so wear the

351
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,279
stickers raise awareness

352
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,639
ask questions of people in power tweet

353
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,240
at the police

354
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:04,640
share what you see them do and recruit

355
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:08,000
others to do the same this works uh

356
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,480
the day before yesterday we went to uh

357
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
to pick up a fridge in owens uh for the

358
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,559
csv village

359
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,919
and on our way we passed the instant

360
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,359
profuse which is

361
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,000
perhaps it's there's no nice way to

362
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,000
describe them

363
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,359
it's it's a chain of restaurants in the

364
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,400
same way the mcdonald's is a restaurant

365
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:34,000
where they do mass-produce not very well

366
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,120
prepared meals but outside there was a

367
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,559
protest

368
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,120
and i really enjoyed that there was a

369
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,918
protest of young people protesting turpo

370
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,918
chickens

371
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,600
and i've never heard of a turbo chicken

372
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,039
so i had to sort of google it and the

373
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,639
guy i was driving with had to

374
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,480
of yeah that's because what you do is

375
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,559
you're treating these

376
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
growth hormones and they can become a

377
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,639
fully pledged

378
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,280
chicken flesh chicken after only a few

379
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,960
months

380
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,320
but they don't have any bones so you

381
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,760
sort of just keep them there so it's a

382
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,320
way of growing the chicken meat

383
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,320
artificially

384
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,240
so now i know i don't like that

385
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,760
and that was just young people and this

386
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,360
might have been a project for them

387
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,840
because they were standing like outside

388
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,439
of owens which in itself is a small town

389
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,918
but but they're standing on one of the

390
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
sort of

391
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,840
roads quite far from the center of town

392
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,960
with banners

393
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,959
that's fucking brilliant

394
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,439
it changed my mind from a position i

395
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,600
didn't know i had

396
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,360
but it's probably not gonna ban the use

397
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,959
of the chickens

398
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,799
and that's why we have the legal track

399
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,559
which i'm sort of promoting

400
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,240
which is hard power because what we're

401
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,960
doing with illegal data retention is

402
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,080
we're using

403
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,520
eu legislation the european

404
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,879
charter on fundamental rights to defeat

405
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,960
the danish politicians

406
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,320
and that's hard power we're stopping

407
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,760
them at cold

408
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,000
and that's quite impressive but it's

409
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,280
also very difficult to tell people with

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,440
a straight face and

411
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,440
without people saying oh wow that's

412
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,320
difficult and i trust live authorities

413
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,799
all of that

414
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,120
so what we do is we educate we fundraise

415
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,639
and we facilitate

416
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,559
and i mainly took facilitate because i

417
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,880
wanted three words but

418
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,799
it's we educate the public like i'm

419
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,960
doing now hopefully is telling you

420
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,918
people why this is important and how we

421
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,320
can do it

422
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,440
we go out there and we raise money and

423
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,120
we facilitate

424
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
for you guys to be able to do your own

425
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,719
processes

426
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,200
one of my which is not related to the

427
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,440
organization against data retention

428
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,440
stickers is a it's like a warning

429
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
sticker that's

430
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,440
semi-transparent so it's meant to be

431
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,760
placed in a

432
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,440
car window and it's a police officer

433
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,120
beating someone sitting down in front of

434
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,280
them

435
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,120
and i do these stickers whenever sticker

436
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,879
mule has an offer on they have an offer

437
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
every week and the offer was transparent

438
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,799
stickers

439
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,240
and i thought this would be interesting

440
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,240
to place in a police car window

441
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,080
and a few days later video emerged

442
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
on the social media and it ended up in

443
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,360
danish media of police officers

444
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:10,640
in denmark feeding people sitting down

445
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,678
not doing anything illegal

446
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,840
so that was kind of a spot on but this

447
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,200
is what i mean when i say facilitate

448
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,720
activism this is for you guys to take

449
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,200
and try and sneak onto a police car

450
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,440
i'm not encouraging you to well i don't

451
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,440
want to really respond

452
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,600
i am encouraging you to do it please do

453
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,840
it but i'm not responsible for for you

454
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,840
being beaten up by the police afterwards

455
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,039
and that's basically what we're doing

456
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,639
please ask the questions of

457
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
us so you can answer them and other

458
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,400
people are asking you because you're

459
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,679
going to be ambassadors to this

460
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,520
you're going to go out there and say

461
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,840
we're doing this we're changing the

462
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,840
world

463
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,600
a bit of a shift the american civil

464
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,120
liberties union is the aclu and that's

465
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,158
what got me into all of this

466
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,760
i knew i liked or i loved the human

467
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,640
rights and the fundamental

468
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,158
principles of the rights of men and i

469
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,600
knew that in america they had this

470
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,760
tradition

471
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,719
for having an organization that can

472
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,960
enter into

473
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,559
and and do amicus brief as they're

474
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,280
called where

475
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
in an american court of law anyone can

476
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,399
enter

477
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,000
any case so i can enter on the side of

478
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,120
for instance the government and say oh

479
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,520
you need to do this

480
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,439
or i can enter on the side of the victim

481
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,559
and saying for these reasons we should

482
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,600
go this way

483
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,600
in denmark this has been prohibited

484
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,959
and they've done all they could to to

485
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,959
discourage

486
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,400
us from taking these suits i've talked

487
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,760
about that earlier

488
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,559
so today i'm just going to focus on the

489
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,120
aclu because they are the reason

490
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,600
that american women can have an abortion

491
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,080
they are

492
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,559
part of ending slavery they are the

493
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,399
reason lgbt people have rights

494
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,000
they are fighting for the migrants

495
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,000
rights which is interesting because

496
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,880
america was founded by migrants coming

497
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,679
there taking the

498
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,200
place from somewhere else and now trying

499
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,200
to keep other people out

500
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,880
it's marvelous but also the right to

501
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,080
vote which in america is not just the

502
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,120
females but also the black people

503
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,039
and as in denmark people with with any

504
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,799
kind of psychiatric disorder

505
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:21,280
and in america and this brilliant thing

506
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,280
they take the right to vote away from

507
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,240
people they deem to be criminals

508
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,840
which is the best way ever to to keep

509
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,760
your opponents out of

510
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,480
of the political debate all you have to

511
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,000
do is criminalize what they're doing

512
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,440
and that's what they've done in america

513
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,760
with the whole three strikes and you're

514
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,600
out

515
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,120
but only for certain offenses that most

516
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,678
black people commit that's a different

517
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,158
story

518
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,880
the aclu i want you to know about them

519
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,559
that just

520
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,799
this is a documentary that just came out

521
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,840
about four cases in the aclu

522
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,960
that they're currently fighting as a

523
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,639
documentary that

524
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,480
we don't have the right to show it here

525
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,080
but i would i wouldn't mind pointing

526
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,880
anyone in the direction of where to get

527
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,039
it anyway

528
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,640
and i'm working on in september having a

529
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,679
screening of it in copenhagen

530
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,880
and i can really recommend it

531
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,000
this is what i need this is the american

532
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,400
supreme court

533
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,880
with people protesting while the aclu is

534
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,640
inside arguing

535
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,280
that's the difficult part about doing

536
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,360
the legal track in this activism

537
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,639
i need to convince the media to talk

538
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,799
about it and that's fucking difficult

539
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,799
last year there was an award ceremony

540
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:30,960
for the people who had fought most

541
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:34,879
for the human rights in denmark

542
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,880
and not that i'm bitter but

543
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,960
uh two of the people nominated are

544
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,400
journalists

545
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,240
who've only ever written about it

546
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,240
whenever i've been pushing them to do it

547
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,960
and and for every ten times i've tried

548
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,559
they write about it once

549
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:52,720
so i need this i need you all to go out

550
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,559
and protest when we have this when we

551
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,279
have these meetings when we have these

552
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,600
courts

553
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,960
when we have this it doesn't need to be

554
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,439
inside this building

555
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,320
like when we when we sued the government

556
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,200
we did file

557
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,799
a lawsuit but we do that online instead

558
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,919
we went to the court

559
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,760
just with a pretend subpoena

560
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,520
and we filed it pretend because they

561
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,200
don't accept physical post

562
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,039
but that was sort of for the media to

563
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,919
understand it this one

564
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,120
uh is lgbt rights this one is uh

565
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,360
abortion

566
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,239
and this one was the muslim ban the

567
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,719
trump one

568
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,720
so they're there at the minute in more

569
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,919
than 100 lawsuits against the trump

570
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
administration and local

571
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,200
administrations fighting for these

572
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,719
things

573
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,799
now i'm going to start off a danish

574
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,480
version of this

575
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,480
and this is going to be interesting

576
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,400
because i'm in the process

577
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,159
of getting a lot of money to do it so

578
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,559
this is further closer to

579
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,840
to to to being a thing than it's ever

580
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,840
been before

581
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,199
so if you want to join me and help me

582
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,678
you don't have to be lawyers

583
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,720
i i need activists i need creative

584
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,480
people i need

585
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,080
people who want to do a bit of the admin

586
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
so i'm not the only one holding all of

587
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,600
this up

588
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
please do get in touch and get some of

589
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,439
the stickers

590
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,559
illegal data retention which is why i'm

591
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,679
mainly here

592
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,399
is where we are at the minute

593
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,600
we are very close to finishing it which

594
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,760
is nice

595
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,840
i'm going to focus again on what's

596
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,679
happened since last we saw each other

597
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,120
the danish telcos are legally retaining

598
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,840
customers data you know that

599
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,199
now we know that 72 of the danish

600
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,360
parliament is in favor

601
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,120
of any surveillance regardless of

602
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,360
whether it works

603
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,360
and that's because i have pushed some of

604
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,158
the members of parliament on our side

605
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,639
to force parliament to have hearings on

606
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,360
this

607
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,080
where all members or all parties have to

608
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,479
come and

609
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,240
defend their position and they're quite

610
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,600
happy to go up there and say yeah

611
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,679
well it's just one surveillance just for

612
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,158
the course of it

613
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,440
um and we also have the the weird

614
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,279
situation where

615
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,520
this was because in the tilito watson

616
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,760
case uh which was uh where the judgment

617
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,240
was handed down in 2016

618
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,600
uh in the beginning of 2017 danish

619
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,039
government said yeah

620
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,959
we're not allowed to keep doing this

621
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,879
they've obviously told us now

622
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,080
but we found this art case from the

623
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,440
danish high court

624
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,158
saying oh but you you might be able to

625
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,760
uphold

626
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,000
the situation for up to 12 months

627
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,080
that was in itself wrong but that was

628
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
their only argument was we have 12

629
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,120
months to fix it

630
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,279
and that was in 2017 i'm unsure if

631
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,000
12 months have passed since but people

632
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,000
tell me they have

633
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,320
since we were last here one year ago

634
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,279
scandals one to four

635
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,480
we had a massive uh scandal that you're

636
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,240
all gonna love and i

637
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,760
it's difficult for me to explain it to

638
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
people who don't do programming or

639
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,480
scripting

640
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,480
but what they've done is all of this

641
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,000
illegal data when they get it in

642
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,559
it might not show what they want this

643
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,600
show so they went out to a private

644
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,158
company and said

645
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,760
please build us close software that's

646
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,760
going to transform this data

647
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,000
that we don't understand into something

648
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,080
that supports our case

649
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,640
closed source software to help one side

650
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,720
in a lawsuit or in a criminal case even

651
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,000
it's mental in and of itself but because

652
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,440
they're not all as clever as the

653
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,799
people's assembled here today

654
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,840
or watching on the live stream uh

655
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,600
it was allowed and now the people

656
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,439
responsible for this the technicians

657
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,439
sitting there were like

658
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,760
okay but uh it's very important that we

659
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,600
get this information out quickly

660
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,279
and the reason that's important is not

661
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,120
because it's important cases

662
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,799
it's because the only way to get the

663
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,559
data without a court order

664
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,559
was to say they needed to do it quickly

665
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,559
so instead of sitting there waiting for

666
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,080
the the closed source software to finish

667
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,480
processing in ways they didn't

668
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,320
understand and then send it to the

669
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,120
people who need it they built a script

670
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,760
like a bash script saying after 15

671
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,959
minutes

672
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,960
send whatever is done

673
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,439
so there might have been exculpatory

674
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,120
evidence that was just rendered after

675
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,799
the 15 minutes

676
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,879
but that wasn't sent so the court never

677
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,200
got it

678
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,000
it's true this is real life it's like a

679
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,039
stand-up show

680
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,320
but how can you how can anyone

681
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,840
i went to like i i went as a journalist

682
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,960
both to the press conference where the

683
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,439
minister sort of

684
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,320
discovered like he he vindicated

685
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,120
everyone in his

686
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,559
ministry despite what we now knew they

687
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,080
knew about this and didn't do

688
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,760
anything about it they knew about it

689
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,120
during the election and chose to keep it

690
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,799
a secret

691
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,479
and he said ah nobody's done anything

692
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,440
wrong and then i went from there to the

693
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,399
police own

694
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,960
briefing with the technicians and

695
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,959
they're like yeah

696
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,760
so there's this magic thing called

697
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,159
scripts

698
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,600
and it says how could you people and

699
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,880
they're like no we don't believe we've

700
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,158
done anything wrong because it's very

701
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,039
important whenever you have a child

702
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,559
molester

703
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,320
okay but have you ever had a child

704
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,960
molester where you needed the location

705
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,240
data

706
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,279
no no but if we had yeah so that wasn't

707
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,360
good

708
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,200
and we had three more since then where

709
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,080
it turns out the telcos are not just

710
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,760
logging uh where you are or the metadata

711
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,399
they're also logging the content of your

712
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,399
unencrypted texts

713
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,239
and that's interesting because telco in

714
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,399
this case was taylor norm

715
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,600
which is around the world which where i

716
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,120
used to work

717
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,879
and whom i got in touch with after we

718
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,120
filed the lawsuit and we went to a

719
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,840
meeting with their leading general

720
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,039
counsel

721
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,600
like the the the the i don't know cto of

722
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,200
of

723
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,799
law stuff cielo and she looked us in the

724
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,840
eyes and said don't worry

725
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,320
we're not logging the content of

726
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,520
anything

727
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,080
and now we know they do and they did

728
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,080
and they knew

729
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
so so that's sort of difficult to say

730
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,480
that

731
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,039
without people saying okay you seem like

732
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,520
a bit of a nutter but i can document all

733
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,399
of this

734
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,679
with like written that this is how is

735
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,959
this happening with with

736
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,679
so little attention uh those were the

737
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,440
scandals

738
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,520
and we've used these in court as well to

739
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,360
stop it from uh from being

740
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,000
delayed more we've also received the

741
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,479
opinion

742
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,080
of the advocate general at the european

743
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,080
union court of justice

744
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:23,439
with the beautiful justice eu acronym

745
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,080
now when you have a case at the european

746
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,559
court

747
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,240
it's usually the the courts of the with

748
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,000
the question in the country

749
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,279
in this case it's it's a french court

750
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,200
and a belgian court

751
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,960
who have sent cases to the european

752
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,600
union's court of justice

753
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,120
to ask them how should we interpret the

754
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,600
law of the european union

755
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,600
in this regard but as i said before a

756
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,120
lot of people can join filing amicus

757
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,120
briefs and the danish government did

758
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,039
that and many others have done that

759
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,360
and once they have all that they hold

760
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,200
the hearings and then you get an opinion

761
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,678
from the advocate general

762
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,440
who is not a part of the court as such

763
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,559
he's not a judge in himself

764
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,320
but he comes up with like an overview

765
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,600
and for these reasons i feel like we

766
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,760
should go in this direction

767
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,199
but obviously it's up to the courts and

768
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,679
it's brilliant

769
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,880
it's all on our side and he's i'm gonna

770
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,320
come back to it because there's some

771
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,240
juicy bits in there

772
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,360
um but even then the danish police

773
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,399
have a spokesperson

774
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,479
who is struggling with the truth

775
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,239
um so he's already out there saying oh

776
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,360
yeah yeah when they say that we're not

777
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,080
allowed to do that

778
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,399
what they mean is that we've done that

779
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,199
slightly wrong we should do more of it

780
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,000
that kind of argument and and on the

781
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,840
basis of this

782
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,919
the danish court have given us a court

783
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,918
date this monday so next monday

784
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,919
is going to be what's uh preparatory

785
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,720
court meeting is on the phone

786
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,000
and we're going to set a date for the

787
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,519
general hearing

788
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,039
and that's very important and that's

789
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,399
very interesting and it's probably going

790
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,640
to be in january

791
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,158
and what comes with this date is also a

792
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,799
date of uh

793
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,399
when you end the preparatory work so

794
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,120
it's going to be sometime november

795
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,760
december

796
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,479
from then the government cannot add any

797
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,000
arguments

798
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,080
they cannot they cannot change their

799
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
opinion they're going to be locked into

800
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,158
this

801
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,159
and then in january we're going to be

802
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,279
there and we're going to beat them and

803
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,480
obviously i need you guys but we're

804
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,080
going to come back to that

805
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,200
this is from the opinion of the advocate

806
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,760
general he says we told you this

807
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,080
and we told you this again to stop

808
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,480
asking us the same fucking question

809
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,279
he uses more legalese language but i'm

810
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,279
translating it

811
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,279
he also says obviously the culture of

812
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,360
hope but we've already decided it would

813
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,039
be silly to do anything else

814
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,879
and then in in he says so regardless of

815
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,919
the fear of crime you cannot justify

816
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,919
surveilling everyone

817
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,679
all of the time and that's the one you

818
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,600
come back to when they're saying oh yes

819
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,399
but what if a terrorist

820
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,080
held your wife at gunpoint and the only

821
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,879
way to figure out who they are

822
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,080
is to go back and see where they've been

823
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,159
and he's just saying stop

824
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,279
it there's nothing that's that bad that

825
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:07,360
it can rectify or justify us doing this

826
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:10,480
all of the time and this is interesting

827
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,320
have i yes um because one of the

828
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,480
arguments

829
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,480
that the courts have said is okay but

830
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,600
imagine this

831
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,360
pedophiles so

832
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,519
we have in the european charter

833
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,320
of civil liberties children have the

834
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:31,600
right not to be violated

835
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,120
and in order for us to to uphold the

836
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,360
right not to be violated

837
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,279
we need to surveil all of the people all

838
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,320
of the time

839
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:43,279
and he just says well no

840
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,039
no no no no stop this and and this is

841
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,240
interesting because this isn't very far

842
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,320
from what he says

843
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,360
it is just yes obviously pedophilia is

844
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,678
bad

845
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,519
but two things you can do things about

846
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,120
it without surveying everyone

847
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,760
and when we have this conflict of rights

848
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,959
like i have the right to freedom of

849
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,120
expression

850
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,039
but if i say that all muslims rape their

851
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,279
children that would be racist

852
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,199
and it would also violate the rights of

853
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,960
those people i would say that about

854
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,560
people have a hard time understanding

855
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,280
this but this is a clear-cut

856
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,279
violation or a conflict of rights

857
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:24,078
and even though people is very bad

858
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,599
you cannot say that the right of a few

859
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:30,639
of children not to be violated

860
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,359
can be protected by surveillance

861
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,440
and not to a degree where this is

862
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,520
proportionate with what you're doing

863
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,000
we could also lock up all men because

864
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,918
it's usually men

865
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,359
and and then well yeah i keep the

866
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,239
children i don't know like

867
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,078
feeding parts but that would violate

868
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,678
other rights so we shouldn't do that

869
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,399
that's a bad idea

870
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,800
and and this is interesting because this

871
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,399
is such a silly argument

872
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,560
that it's difficult for the danish

873
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,520
government to come up with anything

874
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,960
to spin this any other way and i'm

875
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,200
really looking forward to seeing them

876
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,200
try

877
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,800
another argument that they've come up

878
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,560
with is oh yes

879
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,800
we know the court has told us not to do

880
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,799
this but they haven't told us what to do

881
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,240
instead

882
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,079
and i've been sort of i've been on

883
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,200
television and on the radio trying to

884
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,119
say but that's not the core

885
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,399
problem you're violating people's rights

886
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,160
it's not up to the course to tell you

887
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,839
how to get away with it

888
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,078
like i usually say okay so there's a

889
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:34,320
bank robber standing before a judge

890
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,520
saying yeah but how else am i gonna earn

891
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,359
money

892
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,640
no one's gonna say oh well yeah that is

893
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,880
a good question

894
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,879
really we need to vacate the premises

895
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,480
and not really give him any sentencing

896
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,400
because we're not able to tell him how

897
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,520
to make money off of his very limited

898
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,800
skill set

899
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,000
he has been caught so so i i came up

900
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,760
with this it's not up to the court to

901
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,960
write new legislation montesquieu who

902
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,640
came up with the whole division of

903
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,040
powers he's spinning so hard in his

904
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,799
grave

905
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,880
the french government because he's

906
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,599
buried in paris is considering using the

907
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,359
cemetery as a thermal power plant

908
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,960
because it's really now we're we're

909
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,640
looking at him spinning at more than

910
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:15,200
the speed of sound um it's just

911
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,200
how can the legislator and the the the

912
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,880
executive branch of government say oh

913
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,400
yeah

914
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,480
so you're telling us what we're doing is

915
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,150
wrong well why don't you try to make the

916
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,960
legislation

917
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:28,000
[Music]

918
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,359
it's it's it's such a a useless argument

919
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,200
and this is what they have left

920
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,119
so so that's why i'm so optimistic that

921
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,078
when we get this the opinion of the

922
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,000
chord

923
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,280
there's there's nothing really that they

924
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,200
can surprise us with

925
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,119
because all of this has been done

926
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,799
another reason i'm i'm positive is

927
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,000
because of the marxim's

928
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,480
case against facebook where the advocate

929
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,119
general

930
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,560
had actually given them some ways out

931
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,040
where they could sort of

932
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,078
tweak it a bit and say okay but facebook

933
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,520
can do these things

934
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,599
and maybe the american government is

935
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,759
allowed to see these things

936
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,280
and the court said okay we read the

937
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,599
opinion of the advocate

938
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,839
but no we're not going to take any of

939
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,720
the consensus pieces

940
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,880
european union citizens rights and

941
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,640
people in the territories are

942
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,400
so much higher than whatever you're

943
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,960
getting from facebook surveilling

944
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,400
everyone so i'm looking forward to

945
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
seeing the opinion from the court in

946
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,480
this one

947
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,480
where the advocate general hasn't given

948
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,880
them any ways out it's going to be

949
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,880
brutal

950
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,640
so coming up i need a happening

951
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,799
when the decision comes because it's

952
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,000
going to be published on the internet

953
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,280
like now it's there i need people in a

954
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,880
room with flags

955
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,000
and and banners shouting yay

956
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,000
regardless of what it says

957
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,880
because that's what journalists want to

958
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,359
cover they need people being happy or

959
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,079
sad

960
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,960
uh on camera and uh and i need your

961
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,880
people uh

962
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,880
to help me do that we're probably gonna

963
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,040
do it in copenhagen but but uh maybe

964
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,680
we'll do it with some people uh

965
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,960
as i was about to say zooming in but

966
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,560
obviously as soon as evil

967
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,359
so joining us on a more respectable

968
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,720
platform

969
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,720
that isn't microsoft teams

970
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,440
imagine that come and join us on

971
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,839
microsoft teams

972
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,000
that's when you okay so if you ever see

973
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,040
a photo of me being sort of held captive

974
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,599
in in like an uh a cave in

975
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,960
albania or somewhere that'll be my code

976
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,640
word to you guys

977
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,560
that'll be use microsoft teams to

978
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,040
contact them then you know

979
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,000
me it's me so the danish court hearing

980
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,680
that's in january

981
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,359
we're going to need an audience so we

982
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,118
need to fill up the courtroom seats and

983
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,200
we need people standing outside

984
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,640
they're not going to deliver the verdict

985
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,520
on the same day because we don't do that

986
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,200
and

987
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,440
which is probably good because they need

988
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,520
some time to write it down

989
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,760
but it's still gonna need people sitting

990
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,800
in there for two reasons one of them

991
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,800
for the press but mostly for the judges

992
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:03,680
because that's

993
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,240
what i can't prove i would like to do it

994
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,680
and that is a suggestion i've made

995
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,680
to do some research about but

996
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,598
do the rulings more often go in in the

997
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,000
direction of the

998
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,520
citizen when the courtroom is full

999
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,720
versus when it's just the citizen and

1000
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,720
their lawyer there

1001
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,839
i don't know but i like to put a bit of

1002
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,399
pressure on the

1003
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,640
on the judges and say hey look this is

1004
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,160
something that people are interested in

1005
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,078
and then when the decision comes we need

1006
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:32,319
a party

1007
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,440
uh again same reason as the others but

1008
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,440
also because we deserve it

1009
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,079
for the danish aclu i need help

1010

me trying to to seek

1013
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,000

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,560

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,399
stuff with the communication stuff with

1019
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,560
just all the boring stuff and some of

1020
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,200
the interesting stuff

1021
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,640
and and you're very welcome was that a

1022
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,160
question

1023
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,520
i do need a better name and that's

1024
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,720
that's a thing it's not going to be

1025
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,079
called the danish

1026
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,598
aslu in the movie they fight

1027
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,079
when they're standing outside they're

1028
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,040
shouting aclu

1029
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,040
we are here we stand with you and i want

1030
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,200
i want our name to be something that can

1031
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,240
be worked into a chant

1032
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,439
that's sort of that's my my spec for

1033
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,680
what i need help with

1034
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,319
is finding a name for this organization

1035
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,160
that can be gendered

1036
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,359
ongoing violations and the reason we

1037
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,359
need the broader

1038
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,480
thing the drones are already talked

1039
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,319
about this is an

1040
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,480
area where they've admitted to

1041
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,839
parliament what we're doing is illegal

1042
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,319
but snooping at borders this is an

1043
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,520
area where during the corona so we

1044
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,160
weren't allowing people in

1045
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,280
unless they had a reasonable reason to

1046
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,279
get into the country

1047
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,920
and one of those could be again with eu

1048
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,760
legislation and civil liberties

1049
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,200
that you had a boyfriend or girlfriend

1050
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,000
or whatever type of partner in the

1051
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,078
country

1052
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,319
and the police said okay fair enough

1053
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,440
we'll need to check your emails and text

1054
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,040
messages to see

1055
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,119
if you're actually in a relationship

1056
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,759
and i said excuse me you can't do that

1057
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,560
that that is a violation of of human

1058
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,760
rights because

1059
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,799
it it it would always be something that

1060
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,640
is protected

1061
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,480
by human rights even in the danish

1062
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,560
constitution which doesn't have many

1063
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,680
that this is a private conversation they

1064
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,200
want access to

1065
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,040
in order to get that they need

1066
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,078
legislation that is clear

1067
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,560
and that is there at the time and that

1068
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,400
is

1069
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,240
reasonable so again we're talking about

1070
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,359
the conflict of rights

1071
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,598
and it needs to be balanced and they had

1072
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,880
none of those things so i got parliament

1073
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,440
to ask a question

1074
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,720
and the police said yeah we did instruct

1075
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,880
the police to do it

1076
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,160
we wrote these cards because apparently

1077
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,720
that's how they communicate with their

1078
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,399
officers

1079
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,040
they write these action cards they're

1080
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,200
called sounds like magic with gathering

1081
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,000
and um and the police can pull them out

1082
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,759
and say okay i need to snoop in this

1083
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,839
and yeah that's illegal we did those

1084
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,119
that was illegal sorry about that

1085
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,400
they didn't even say sorry about that

1086
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,839
they just said yeah we did something

1087
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,839
illegal we stopped that now

1088
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,440
that's it that how can that be how is no

1089
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,680
one being put

1090
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,359
like like how is no one being being

1091
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,560
being held responsible for doing it

1092
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,759
they've said what we did

1093
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,640
we had a computer we wrote a text it was

1094
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,400
illegal

1095
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,319
they did the thing we wrote that was

1096
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,760
illegal and it was illegal

1097
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,680
oh yeah fair enough you're just uh

1098
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,880
mischief

1099
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,359
photographing that's uh general both

1100
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,319
at the pride parade but also at other

1101
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,480
protests

1102
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,839
and then it's something i i thought with

1103
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,520
myself

1104
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,520
i live in nepal which is a part of

1105
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,280
copenhagen where the police are ever

1106
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,839
present because it's so politically

1107
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,839
an interesting area and the police
