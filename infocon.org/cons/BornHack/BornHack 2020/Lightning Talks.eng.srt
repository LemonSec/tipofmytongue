1
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,920
exciting

2
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,879
um it's described in rc uh 7489

3
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,879
for those of you who want to deep dive

4
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,720
it's domain based message authentication

5
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,640
reporting and conformance

6
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:17,120
so it's really um exciting stuff

7
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,399
um most of dmarc is actually technical

8
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,040
but what it adds

9
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,440
is it's something else than a technical

10
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,440
solution

11
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,280
i lost the signal there

12
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,040
oh there it is uh who am i

13
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,360
uh sign out in the real world um in the

14
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,599
analog world my name is dennis

15
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,400
on twitter i'm at sign rtk and there's a

16
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,238
geek code block

17
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,120
you can see if you download the pdf or

18
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,200
view the presentation afterwards

19
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,799
um this is what i'm going through a

20
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,439
quick background who can use it

21
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,239
overview status why is it important and

22
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,079
how does it work

23
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,920
and i'll mention a couple of tools to do

24
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,439
it

25
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,798
um the background is that

26
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,918
in the in the beginning there's no money

27
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,000
to be made of spam from spam because uh

28
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,758
you couldn't use the the opennet

29
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,440
commercially anyway

30
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,360
uh and up through the 80s and 90s it

31
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,919
increased of course and in

32
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
i think around 2010 90 of all emails was

33
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,000
actually spam

34
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,600
you had to do something about it who can

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,720
use dmarc

36
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,080
everybody should they yes

37
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,960
of course um this is a

38
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,198
standard mail delivery uh someone

39
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,039
composed and sends an email

40
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,240
uh sending mail server inserts the d

41
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,759
computer uh

42
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
it is sent to the receiving mail server

43
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
then you do the standard validation

44
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
tests have a

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
blog blog list reputation rate limits

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,880
and whatever then you come into this

47
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,479
exciting green box that actually is the

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,919
dmoc policy

49
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,120
where you retrieve and verify the

50
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,479
dkim you validate the

51
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,800
spf and you apply a policy

52
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,840
which can which can be a past quarantine

53
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,320
or

54
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,320
reject

55
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,280
and the the different parts is

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,159
the smtp part you know where type hello

57
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
and mail from and

58
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,919
stuff like that that's covered in rfc

59
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,880
five three two one

60
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,320
that's the spf uh five three two two is

61
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,080
uh the kim part it's

62
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,360
it's a message header like the content

63
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,199
of the email

64
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
so that's actually what your most male

65
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,479
clients are showing

66
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,239
um so

67
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
it's important to distinguish between

68
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,919
the envelope and the actual letter

69
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,080
if you if you're doing debugging in in

70
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,599
this case but

71
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,120
if you need to do dbr bugging you'll

72
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,919
probably figure it out but keep that in

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
mind uh

74
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,880
if you're ever in that situation

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,880
uh the current status is that it's

76
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,719
working fine it's implemented in the

77
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,800
in most of the mtas the rfc is from 2015

78
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,039
so it's five years ago

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,319
it's uh it's implemented basically in

80
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,560
all mail service you can find

81
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,199
it's in the process of becoming an itf

82
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,199
standard as well

83
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,440
and it's important because it's for the

84
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,120
business it provides better uh

85
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,560
protection of your vein that's probably

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
what you can use as a selling point if

87
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,000
you need time to

88
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
to implement it and the tech importance

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,919
is that it

90
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,600
it allows you to um monitor and collect

91
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,719
reports on the

92
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,759
uh the attempted abuse of of your domain

93
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,160
as as an email sender

94
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
and if you have ever tried implementing

95
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,919
spf and the kim in a

96
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
large environment you'll probably you'll

97
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,479
know that you're working uh

98
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,759
mostly blindfolded and this is where

99
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,840
dmarc can actually help a bit

100
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,880
um it works in the way that you have

101
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,560
your spf record

102
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,319
and don't do it like this because it has

103
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,599
a plus all which basically means

104
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,800
fuck you i don't care uh just anybody

105
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,639
can send on behalf of this domain

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,440
um also don't use this

107
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,800
tilde all because that's kind of a i

108
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,560
don't know i don't care

109
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,120
uh you have to decide yourself it's a

110
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,240
it's somewhere between neutral and fail

111
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,160
but you have to decide on your own um a

112
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,039
proper record looks kind of like this we

113
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,680
have

114
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,120
mx ip addresses or and min end with

115
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
minus all which means that

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,720
no one else and the ones on this list

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,720
can actually send emails

118
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,840
and what it adds is a policy

119
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,080
so you have v equals d mark one is it's

120
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,719
uh

121
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,199
demagogue version one p equals none uh

122
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,039
that is

123
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,400
uh i don't i only want to collect data

124
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,599
on this and the rua is uh is where the

125
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,599
reports are mailed to it's an xml format

126
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,878
and don't parse it yourself there's

127
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,878
online tools to help you with that

128
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,719
you can get this status detail from a

129
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,520
site called the martian

130
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,960
you can see the spf is yellow attention

131
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,599
needed that's because i have the plus

132
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,159
all

133
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,360
and that's not really uh that's another

134
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,400
good thing

135
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
um it's green even though the p equals

136
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,120
none the

137
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,120
no policy is present

138
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,559
the options for policy is none which

139
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,080
means

140
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,439
collect reports you can have quarantine

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,719
that means if someone else

142
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,839
then those on the spf list are sending

143
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,480
a market as spam or you can

144
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,920
have a reject as policy that means if

145
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
anybody else is trying to send it you

146
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,640
should just

147
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,640
discard the email immediately

148
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,279
and do we have time for a live demo

149
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,839
well we have ten slides left and three

150
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,839
minutes but

151
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,000
enjoy

152
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,000
this is the martian interface

153
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
um you can see there are some various

154
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,479
statistics on

155
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,519
the origin of the mail servers mainly

156
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,640
russia

157
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,200
for some reason if you go into

158
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,240
the volume part here you can see that

159
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
it's uh

160
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,000
24 unknown emails in volume details you

161
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,200
can

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,720
see sorted by day or where it is

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,600
and you can actually uh expand this as

164
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,480
well and see

165
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,160
what sending servers are actually doing

166
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,640
this and it's mainly russian as a

167
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,719
chinese and

168
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,160
so you can get reports and see where

169
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,839
your where they are originating from and

170
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,480
you can see that the reporter here

171
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,200
is from google and mail.ru yahoo also

172
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,240
sends

173
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,120
these dmarc reports if you requested but

174
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,800
none of the

175
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,000
other major players is really doing

176
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,359
anything good in this

177
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,240
thing yet but it'll probably

178
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,240
be better soon

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,120
the way that the the text record is made

180
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,199
is this version one then you have the

181
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,360
policy if here you have a quarantine

182
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
as a policy and you can set the pct

183
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
that's the percentage of emails

184
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,519
that are hit by this policy so if you

185
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,560
want to lean softly into it

186
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,320
you can just start by enabling it and

187
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,599
setting it to none to collect reports

188
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,240
and when you're brave enough to actually

189
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,959
enable it

190
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,800
um you can just set it to one percent so

191
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,239
only one percent of your emails

192
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,000
is actually being treated by this and

193
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,000
if you have a large environment it still

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,640
may be many emails but you'll um

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,320
you'll get a better idea and when you uh

196
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
are feeling brave you can set it to five

197
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,279
percent and thirty percent at a hundred

198
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,040
percent and then you can change the

199
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,959
policy from

200
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,279
um from quarantine to reject

201
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,319
and do the increasing of the percentage

202
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,680
again from

203
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:12,079
1 5 30 whatever so dmarc

204
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:15,680
is send a policy framework plus dkim

205
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,479
and the policy um

206
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,239
i'd recommend that you look at

207
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,399
demarcian.eu

208
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,000
run by really nice guy you can it's it's

209
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,920
free for personal use

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,160
so if you have just a couple of domains

211
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,240
just put them in there you can get

212
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,439
the good reports uh and there's also a

213
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,800
list of uh

214
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,519
actually i forgot to show you that um

215
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,519
you can um

216
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,839
here if you go under the main list

217
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
there's a tasks and issues as well so

218
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,880
here you can see that i have a domain

219
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,920
call for deco it needs demark to be

220
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,519
added

221
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
and there's an issue which is that

222
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,279
kubernetes doesn't have a

223
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,560
spf record at all so it actually also

224
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,279
helps you through the process of

225
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,479
actually

226
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,160
enabling dmarc for your domains that's

227
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,440
pretty handy if you're

228
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,839
someone somewhat unsure of the process

229
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,519
but use these two tools uh dmarc uh as i

230
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,079
said uh free for personal use

231
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,880
um if you're a commercial user you can

232
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,719
pay a bid for

233
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,160
for the service and i do that for where

234
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,079
i where i'm

235
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,600
currently at uh also there's

236
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,519
hardeners.com which is

237
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,920
a generic tool for hardenizing all of

238
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,760
your infrastructure also

239
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,160
it checks your cls setup and stuff like

240
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,760
that it's an invite only side but

241
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,079
ask for an advisor pretty fast to let

242
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
you in

243
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,440
things that aren't covered in this talk

244
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,399
is the nsx dane mts

245
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,920
sts and tls reporting you can look that

246
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,959
up for yourself

247
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:53,839
and there's like 45 seconds for

248
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,839
questions if you have any

249
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
yep

250
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:21,680
that's true there is a problem with

251
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:24,560
mailing lists

252
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,920
i i think it's uh it's a matter of

253
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,959
pushing them to doing it

254
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,719
because dmarc is merely the policy of

255
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,160
enforcing center policy framework and

256
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,760
the kim in one tool

257
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,000
with reporting as well um so

258
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,880
it's true that there is uh a problem

259
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,320
with mailing lists in particular but

260
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
there isn't really a lot of commercial

261
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,040
users using

262
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,920
like mailing lists and there is a

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,519
workaround for that as

264
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,399
well if there's any more questions i'm

265
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,000
in the

266
00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:03,839
first of the currents after the info

267
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:03,839
booth feel free to drop by and talk

268
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,839
great yeah thanks

269
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,199
everyone is

270
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,800
hello i'm a first time presenter

271
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,440
so this will be my experiment is to

272
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,000
talk consistently into the microphone

273
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,519
all right

274
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,639
so this lightning talk is i'll give you

275
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,720
the tldr

276
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,519
is i used to spend a lot of time on

277
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,920
exorcism

278
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,720
which is exorcism.io is a learning

279
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,959
project for

280
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
like uh you can learn programming

281
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,079
languages

282
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,759
and i think they have like more than 50

283
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,000
languages you can learn

284
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,480
and uh they have some structural

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,560
problems but they have a mass momentum

286
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,759
and i want to know if there's better

287
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,199
ways to do it where you

288
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:47,120
overcome some of the scaling problems

289
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,719
so this is a call to investigation if

290
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,399
anyone is curious about

291
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,000
collaborative learning platforms

292
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,399
is other ways where we can use

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,519
decentralized

294
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,959
systems like git when it

295
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,800
the subject matter is going to be

296
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,040
programming anyway so

297
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,000
maybe for some learning material git

298
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,079
would be

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,600
a showstopper because they it's a

300
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,839
difficult thing to learn

301
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
but specifically for programming that

302
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,279
might not be a problem at all in fact it

303
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,040
might be a benefit

304
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:22,320
so um i'm gonna start by saying

305
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,439
uh i think in 2008

306
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,480
i started i thought maybe

307
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,800
maybe i should try and learn o'camo and

308
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,800
i

309
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,479
i already know a very similar

310
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,439
programming language so i thought maybe

311
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,160
i can learn that

312
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
like the dialect part like maybe i can

313
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,839
transfer my knowledge from one

314
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
language to the other if i just complete

315
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
a few exercises

316
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,759
it's just like to get to know the syntax

317
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,160
and do a few problems and realize

318
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,680
what are the differences like in dialect

319
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,199
and i think exercise

320
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,959
exorcism was really great for that

321
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,359
because i signed up and i went through

322
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,839
10 exercises where i got custom feedback

323
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,399
from

324
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,959
someone who probably had more experience

325
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,399
with

326
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,958
with ocam than me and

327
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,520
and the waiting time was maybe a day

328
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,240
between

329
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,160
each uh handing in an exercise i got

330
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,679
feedback within a day

331
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,000
and i thought this was fine because i

332
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,400
could just do uh side exercises i could

333
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,079
just

334
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,600
brush up on other things but eventually

335
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,000
i got a bit bored waiting so i thought

336
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,399
i'll just

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,079
open another track like another language

338
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,199
that i'm familiar with maybe i like it

339
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,520
even more

340
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
and that track had that was the haskell

341
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,879
track that track had even

342
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,919
worse performance so

343
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,320
um maybe the average waiting time there

344
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,360
was

345
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,080
uh a week before i got feedback on a

346
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,760
simple

347
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,559
exercise that might have taken me five

348
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,120
minutes to complete so this was very dis

349
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,799
satisfying so i decided okay maybe i'll

350
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,479
just become a mentor on that track and

351
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,918
then i follow the other track so i'm

352
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
learning something and i'm giving

353
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,200
something and that is

354
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,559
only reasonable because i mean i get

355
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,679
other people's time for free i should

356
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,320
give some back right

357
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,960
it's like questing and answering on irc

358
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,240
channels or whatever

359
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,520
but the burden was just so big so i

360
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,520
basically kind of quit learning o'camel

361
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,360
and i just became a

362
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,360
what the role is called a mentor so you

363
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,479
have three roles like a student a mentor

364
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,320
and a maintainer

365
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,240
so there's a part of the infrastructure

366
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,399
for each language track for for example

367
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,559
what are the exercises for this language

368
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
that is that's run one role in the

369
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,360
system is to maintain those

370
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,879
another one is to give feedback so

371
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,360
feedback is given on

372
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,039
the website that is developed in i think

373
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,520
ruby on rails or something

374
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,799
and the organization exorcism the

375
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,559
organization

376
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:42,559
has um kind of a bottleneck because they

377
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,080
they are not an op free open source

378
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,360
software project but they're

379
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,399
a non-profit ngo that

380
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,639
uses open source and free software

381
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
to to kind of reach their goal of kind

382
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,120
of

383
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,520
programming education for everyone or

384
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,320
something like that

385
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,400
but because the organization is running

386
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,559
in in

387
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,799
reproducing the website fixing box

388
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,200
extending the interface for

389
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,360
when people deliver solutions and the

390
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,559
feedback interface for mentors is on the

391
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,320
website

392
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,918
this kind of because there's very

393
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,280
limited amount of of

394
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,360
hired programmers to do this then

395
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,080
the development here has to be kind of

396
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,600
angled and very prioritized and they

397
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,639
don't accept a lot of

398
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,760
outside help because managing

399
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,720
people's uh code for this they kind of

400
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,559
assess is

401
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
is kind of they would end up spending

402
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,440
more resources cultivating the

403
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,799
type of development they expect so this

404
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,679
part is not really open source

405
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,480
it's open source but it's not free free

406
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,600
to come

407
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,960
contribute to and i think that's a like

408
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,080
a massive problem because

409
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,600
one of the bottlenecks is you don't want

410
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,720
to have to wait so for example for the

411
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,199
rush track

412
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,440
if you handle it hand in your solution

413
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,120
to some kind of hello world like problem

414
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
the way the average waiting time would

415
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,799
be two months before you get feedback

416
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,559
that is enough time for you to

417
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,600
completely have either quit the

418
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,678
the uh quit the

419
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,439
learning the language or have found some

420
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,039
other source of learning it right

421
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,799
you don't want to wait two months

422
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,559
between like very simple assignments

423
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,679
that take maybe 10 or 15 minutes to

424
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,600
complete

425
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,440
so of course exorcism has addressed

426
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,760
these problems by

427
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,240
trying to automate some of the feedback

428
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,799
mechanisms by making autograders and

429
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,880
this

430
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,360
this is a massive effort because every

431
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,440
single language has to

432
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,879
build the exercises from the bottom up

433
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,559
with these in mind

434
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,080
some of some languages don't have the

435
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,960
same infrastructure for

436
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,240
passing itself and doing syntax trees so

437
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,120
for example

438
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,960
languages like c-sharp is this is really

439
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,719
easy because you have a

440
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,799
well compiler support for that and

441
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,200
python i think is pretty easy too

442
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
and you also have a like a an abundance

443
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
of people who want to do that for those

444
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,799
languages but

445
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,719
maybe for pearl you don't have the same

446
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,280
luxury of a lot of people contributing

447
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,640
uh hours and hours of work

448
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,080
so this is some of my experience with

449
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
the platform i think it's an excellent

450
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,520
platform and it has some bottlenecks

451
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,159
and also the last thing i would

452
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,158
highlight

453
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,480
from from having experience with it is

454
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,480
when you contribute you get access to a

455
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
website where you can upload a file and

456
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,000
you get a command line tool

457
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,360
where you can

458
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
where you can upload it using the

459
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,520
command line tool so if you're writing

460
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,360
in

461
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,720
your solution in a file on your file

462
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,639
system you can use

463
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,039
that command line interface to upload

464
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,520
your files this is really smart

465
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,760
but it's also kind of a simulation or an

466
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,760
approximation of a similar command you

467
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,520
might use as a real developer using git

468
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,640
or something similar and

469
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,000
what i think is maybe make that part

470
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,880
more realistic because you're going to

471
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
learn to do that

472
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,400
anyway so why create like a separate

473
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,320
ecosystem

474
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:07,520
only for simulating real work why not

475
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,480
use git to fully leverage the the

476
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,600
decentralized aspects of this platform

477
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,400
and uh having kind of

478
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,799
pointed out at least most of the scaling

479
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,480
problems in terms of there's not enough

480
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,879
mentoring capacity and

481
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,080
the software infrastructure for the

482
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,360
exorcism project

483
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,360
also has some development bottlenecks

484
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,760
at one direction that i would propose is

485
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,439
to to look at

486
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,600
something like github classrooms which

487
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,679
is something that was released by github

488
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,760
this year i think

489
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,400
which is kind of like intended for

490
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,600
school systems that they can create

491
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,440
organizations

492
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,320
and projects and assignments and

493
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,240
you have these entities inside the

494
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,439
github classroom system

495
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,080
and then work from there see if if

496
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,679
github github is enough or if we want to

497
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,199
kind of

498
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,840
take it even further go more

499
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,919
decentralized and basically

500
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,600
reinvent this kind of collaborative

501
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,280
learning where everyone is kind of

502
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,399
connected as a node in the

503
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,440
system uh i will be spending a bit of

504
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,840
time doing this

505
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,200
today and if anyone is interested in

506
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,918
collaborative programming platforms

507
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,480
growing them using them uh come and talk

508
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,640
to me and

509
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,840
maybe you have some good ideas or maybe

510
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,520
you have a completely different

511
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,799
experience report

512
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,840
and i would also like to hear that so

513
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
that concludes my talk

514
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,929
[Applause]

515
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,279
here after the

516
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,480
thing and also i have a workshop

517
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,159
tomorrow uh called solving jq problems

518
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,320
and this would be a good place where we

519
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,840
can kind of bootstrap for example

520
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,000
github classrooms because it will be a

521
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,760
workshop and it it would be possible to

522
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,080
use github classroom so

523
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,000
at least the next time i'm on schedule

524
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,000
is in that workshop

525
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,840
but otherwise immediately after the

526
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,840
lightning talks i'll be around

527
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:59,439
this is very unprepared but

528
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:03,520
this two three days ago

529
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:11,840
last weekend we lost you and one more

530
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:11,840
lesson from them

531
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,000
okay yeah can everybody hear me you're

532
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,520
great good

533
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,919
okay so uh this week uh just before one

534
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,158
hack

535
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,679
uh me and my friend we were playing in

536
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,039
the def con

537
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,000
finals ctf uh the team

538
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,919
team north code which is a like a

539
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,760
collaboration team between all of the

540
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:48,159
nordic's nordic teams ctf teams

541
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,760
the best teams so hacking for certio and

542
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,559
boot blogs

543
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,279
collaborate on competing in yeah the

544
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,678
hardest

545
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,200
ctf competition like ever

546
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,000
yeah and we're going to talk a bit about

547
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,360
that and we actually hope that you have

548
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,640
mostly questions for us about how it is

549
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,600
so um yeah it was an amd ctf

550
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,120
which means everybody has a server and

551
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,559
then we are like trying to hack each

552
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,918
other services

553
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:21,039
and there is no sla so

554
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,360
like there's no like uh machine checking

555
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,640
if the binary is correct or you just

556
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,799
passed everything uh

557
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,000
patched the service out you didn't have

558
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,559
like ssh

559
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,200
into the vulnerable vulnerable box

560
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,399
itself

561
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,440
but you have like this form um maybe a

562
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,360
bit hard to see

563
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,760
but it's like here you can submit flags

564
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,240
or create and like auto smita based on

565
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,039
it

566
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,000
and then only chances get released here

567
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,240
and you'll get like

568
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,679
p caps from all the servers and here you

569
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,760
could also submit patches

570
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,279
because if you find a vulnerability

571
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,158
start saving one team

572
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:56,000
like go start making an exploit and then

573
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,799
you have like another half of the of the

574
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,840
team

575
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,399
go uh make a a patch for this

576
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,320
and then you were very limited in how

577
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,479
these patches could be applied

578
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,799
so often you could at most edit a few

579
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,080
hundred bytes so so you really had to

580
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,720
patch in the binary

581
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,320
and of course in these kind of channels

582
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,679
you don't um

583
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,439
you don't get the source code so um

584
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,200
so yeah you only have like the binary

585
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,559
format you have to reverse it

586
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,480
and just to kind of peek into how

587
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,120
how hard extremely hard are these

588
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,760
challenges so one of them the first was

589
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,158
like

590
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,200
a parallel operating system built

591
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,880
completely from

592
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,559
scratch and also a a custom architecture

593
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,159
so it was a binary file that like

594
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:48,158
um yeah that that brand as a vm

595
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,520
uh on top of that there was some there

596
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,919
was some

597
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,360
uh some services running inside of these

598
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,200
this custom vm

599
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,080
and it was all written in a custom

600
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,080
architecture you never seen before and

601
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,480
also the os was still like

602
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,600
dynamically load uh load files like from

603
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,120
elf and so on

604
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,199
but it completely cost them uh os

605
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,719
and architecture and then you had to

606
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,520
like reverse these

607
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,200
and and find the exploit in these

608
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,679
pre-installed files so you really have

609
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,120
to

610
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:22,480
reverse an entire virtual

611
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,520
machine from scratch and you have like

612
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,559
eight hours or so before the shift ends

613
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,480
to do this

614
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,840
so that is the kind of level we're

615
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,919
talking about here

616
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,320
um and we have also

617
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,600
we have also some brought some images i

618
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,399
just found them here

619
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,399
if i can get my mouse over here

620
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,760
okay i can take this oh yeah oh yeah

621
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,799
this is also very good

622
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,000
yeah so that is kind of like a what we

623
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,240
call meanwhile uh so that is an overview

624
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,440
of all the teams our auto flag

625
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,360
submission system

626
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,120
so we just like put a python script and

627
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,840
it just prints out flags

628
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,799
in sdv out and then this system would

629
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,918
automatically

630
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,399
like fight the play in in all these lots

631
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,080
here it's like our runners so uh the

632
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,799
scripts that we run

633
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,439
um yeah and here we can see all of the

634
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,080
teams

635
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,880
we got a tenth by the way yeah

636
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,879
competition of

637
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,480
which is the most important thing but

638
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,480
yeah

639
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,679
we also had some practical stuff so as

640
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,000
alexander said we

641
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,919
were we met at in stockholm with all the

642
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,520
other people from the other teams

643
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,919
and um there you can also we also have

644
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,720
some

645
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,440
photos here one of the challenges was a

646
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,679
uh

647
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,039
a capture the flag and no no no king of

648
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,679
the hill sorry it's the king of the hill

649
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,000
challenge

650
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,880
where you had to um you had to create an

651
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,279
ai that

652
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,240
was to compete with the other with the

653
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,840
other people

654
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,760
so you upload your air and that control

655
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,120
a little ship that had to to shoot all

656
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,158
the other ships

657
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,360
and and um well it wasn't only that

658
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
simple because they had

659
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,439
also put in some intentional bugs uh in

660
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,600
the in the code that actually ran this

661
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,440
so it had a buffer overflow at least

662
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,480
that's the one we found

663
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,640
where you could actually um extend

664
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,000
so you were able to extend the space and

665
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,080
overwrite some of the checks

666
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,120
for the size of this ai so so you can

667
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,360
get a big ai

668
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,439
with that was better at attacking the

669
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,439
other people and here we have a little

670
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,039
photo of everybody standing around the

671
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,640
same screen and looking at the

672
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,240
at the small planes flying around and

673
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,760
shooting each other

674
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,840
that's five minutes um

675
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,600
right and then we have other pictures

676
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,519
here oh and i have those

677
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,360
at here

678
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,640
yes so this was the venue we were

679
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,519
sitting at and uh

680
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,080
we were at the venue we were 20 people

681
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,120
and

682
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,439
there were about five to ten uh

683
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,479
at their own homes on discord uh helping

684
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,399
us but

685
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,679
maybe a bit more but but it was mainly

686
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:04,239
the people at the venue

687
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,960
we like that's right yeah when's active

688
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
with and

689
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,640
it's it's also a bit easier when you're

690
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,159
just sitting in the same place to help

691
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,159
on so this will say like

692
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:19,199
for uh government this competition

693
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,559
it had all the food and everything we

694
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,039
needed everything was just

695
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,840
sponsored so it was no time to get pizza

696
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,840
someone brought it

697
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,360
yeah that's also one of the lessons

698
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,799
learned so we had booked a

699
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,840
a hotel uh close by that we did not use

700
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,760
at all uh it was there was like

701
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,000
you had to be ready if if anything

702
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,158
happened and and also like spending

703
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,880
those extra 15 minutes walking back and

704
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,440
forth

705
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,440
it's time wasted yeah so uh so it's

706
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,559
really time intensive you just have to

707
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,039
be there all the time

708
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,760
get four hours to sleep at most and then

709
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,039
back

710
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,640
yes there were downtime in between

711
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,000
when when you couldn't and when you

712
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
couldn't harvest flex from the other

713
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
teams

714
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,640
but um but but then you still had the

715
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,760
you still had the binaries and you're

716
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,960
still able to

717
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,519
to to to reverse engineer those uh still

718
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,440
so

719
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,200
so there were really you really had to

720
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,399
choose when to when to go to bed and

721
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,480
when not to

722
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,678
so it was structured and shift so it was

723
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,559
like when you

724
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,760
the server gets up you get one hour to

725
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,440
set everything up

726
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,480
and then after that hour it starts

727
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,679
then it flat flex starts coming in and

728
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,679
every like six minutes

729
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,760
and six minutes then six minutes with

730
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,559
one tick every tick there's new flank

731
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,559
and zero

732
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,240
so every six minutes you can like go get

733
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,799
another black with the same eight points

734
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,840
and then

735
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,840
have time

736
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,199
then it will like after eight hours or

737
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,200
something then it will go down and say

738
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,720
okay now the server is closed now you

739
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,760
can reverse your union you can start

740
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,080
making patches

741
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,158
so everything is ready when next shift

742
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,799
starts and at the beginning at each

743
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,279
shift

744
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:59,840
is like there comes some new chances and

745
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,559
you will

746
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,120
just have to leave and then the other

747
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,760
teams are

748
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,039
very very good like like really good for

749
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,879
instance we had one

750
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,800
uh one um one like module that was

751
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,879
module written in node.js and it had

752
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,399
some bucks in it and the best team like

753
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,279
no they didn't actually win but the ones

754
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:20,000
that were

755
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,399
leading the most of the time they found

756
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,399
they

757
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,839
they got a flag in the first tick so

758
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,159
within the first six minutes they had a

759
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,239
working exploit against it

760
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,520
and then you're really like okay now now

761
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,959
we also have to find something because

762
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,719
they're harvesting flags at least trying

763
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,560
to patch it or something like that

764
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,158
so extremely hard competition yeah and

765
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,759
the other thing is extremely good

766
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,960
yeah so yeah so yes any questions about

767
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,960
uh being at the fdr

768
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,158
yeah no well no but but there were caps

769
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,639
given

770
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,520
by the game um what's it called like the

771
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,200
game network

772
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,040
yeah the game there was like this

773
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,960
instance that run all of the servers

774
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,240
so we were also getting pcaps from all

775
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,480
the other teams

776
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,319
or kinda there are two ports you could

777
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,800
attack on one stealth port and the long

778
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,400
board

779
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,920
if you hack on the long port you get

780
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,599
full point but everything

781
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,079
everyone can see all the traffic and the

782
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,960
normal port still point still for

783
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,760
half the points but there is no peak at

784
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,440
released

785
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,680
so you can kind of have to decide

786
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,160
whether or not you want to stop this

787
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,919
or not we also there was some some of

788
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,399
the challenges was solved because of the

789
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,400
p caps

790
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,560
but many many many of the good teams at

791
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,720
least of course

792
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,240
like sends a lot of bullshit with the

793
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,240
with the with the actual exploit

794
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,320
no no no no but we didn't we didn't

795
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,560
sleep no you were just released to us

796
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,079
then we could go through them and yeah

797
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,920
that was a lot of help and it's like

798
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,480
it's like a really big meter game

799
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,880
because you could also submit patches

800
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
and the patches you package for catching

801
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,000
your vulnerability

802
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,040
that's also exposed so people can go

803
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,119
like just

804
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,119
if they can figure out how this path

805
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:12,950
works just go and copy it

806
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:16,200
and you can of course background because

807
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,200
[Applause]

808
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,920
you
