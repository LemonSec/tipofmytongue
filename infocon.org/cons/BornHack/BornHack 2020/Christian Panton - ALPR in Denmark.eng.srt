1
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
um

2
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:23,120
and then

3
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,198
you so um

4
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,639
this is sort of an iteration of a talk

5
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,720
i've been giving for a few years

6
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,639
um so if you've seen some of the parts

7
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,960
and some of the jokes please still laugh

8
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,160
because they're still funny uh but i

9
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,799
added a lot of content

10
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,680
because uh license plate readers in

11
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,199
denmark have been

12
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,600
fairly growing over the past few days a

13
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,759
few

14
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,199
years here in denmark where it started

15
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,160
out in sort of

16
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,800
only policing it's becoming more

17
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,800
prevalent

18
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,120
across the board and i want to give an

19
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,520
introduction to to

20
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
what is going on with the license plate

21
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,599
readers in denmark

22
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,319
and what's going on with sort of the

23
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,479
entities that are starting to use them

24
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,800
but first like why did i get into this

25
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
so i'm a guy who takes pictures of

26
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
things that sits in pools

27
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,198
in the sort of traffic space

28
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,520
i i really am curious about what

29
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,360
a thing like this was for instance so

30
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,880
you can look it up but it's a

31
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,080
clear forward-looking infrared

32
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,880
based sensor that can be used to detect

33
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,599
cars

34
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
but also people these are being put up

35
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,560
in in

36
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,159
cities because it's cheaper than digging

37
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,479
down

38
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
spools to detect cars inside the

39
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,359
concrete

40
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
and it's easy to reconfigure if you have

41
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,479
roadworks for instance

42
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,080
so this is a very common technology but

43
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,800
it actually doesn't have a feed out so

44
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,440
you can

45
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,319
watch it in real time so those are like

46
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,039
a thing that i'm

47
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,759
interested in of course other boxes that

48
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,990
are sitting in

49
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,039
in in the

50
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,720
[Music]

51
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,318
in light poles and stuff like that first

52
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,039
of all there's like a camera here but

53
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,479
that's

54
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,240
pretty standard now but there's also

55
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,599
like things that detect wi-fi there's

56
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
things that take bluetooth and other

57
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,759
things

58
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,520
those things are already always

59
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,039
interesting to see therefore i take

60
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,639
pictures of it and try to identify them

61
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,318
and figure out the purpose and who sets

62
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,479
them up to figure out like what do

63
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,440
all these boxes in our sort of outdoor

64
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,440
environment actually do

65
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,080
more boxes here uh this one very

66
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
recently just came up i haven't looked

67
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,960
up what it is

68
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,960
but there was just something sitting

69
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,758
almost outside of my house

70
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,319
and the other thing over there is a blip

71
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,440
track they do bluetooth based

72
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,080
commute distance and

73
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
also now they do some corona policing

74
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,519
because they try to detect how many

75
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,360
people are in an area

76
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
so generally like i look all up all this

77
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,880
stuff so

78
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,880
a good thing about that is that i take

79
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,959
digital photographs of everything so i

80
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,399
know exactly when

81
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,359
i got interested in license plate

82
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,880
readers or alpr automatic license plate

83
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,279
readers and that is from metadata

84
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,279
of the picture so that was back in 2016.

85
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,120
this is the first picture i've taken

86
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,360
it's

87
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,399
on a street that is very i live in

88
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,399
episode and

89
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,000
this is in glow stop this is the main

90
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,720
road towards copenhagen

91
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
if you don't go by highway and it was

92
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,880
suddenly sitting there in the middle of

93
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,880
the road

94
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
and i go by you can see that it's a

95
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,680
little bit blurry so it's kind of like

96
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
what is going on here i go by my bike

97
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,399
and you take a picture

98
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,640
and then of course let's take a uh sorry

99
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,360
yeah that was the picture of them one

100
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,279
slide ahead sorry about that

101
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,720
um and take a few more pictures of this

102
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,920
and this is generally what i do like

103
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,880
trying to figure out what is this thing

104
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,760
right

105
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,760
and uh i don't even know why i took a

106
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,519
picture of the manufacturer of the pool

107
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,600
i thought that would be nice but now i

108
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,080
know a lot about

109
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,040
like the impact that a pool can resist

110
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,560
before it's breaking and

111
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,560
the failure characteristics of it so

112
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,160
sometimes you get off on the wrong foot

113
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
there but then you can sometimes take a

114
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
really good

115
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,479
like clear picture of what's going on in

116
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,920
the business end of the poll

117
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,399
and then you can start to identify this

118
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,160
so i didn't waste time

119
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,320
one minute after i put a picture on

120
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,079
twitter of all of this

121
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,160
um and i think less than an hour later

122
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,399
i figured out what it was so it was this

123
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,680
genotech overview sharp it's called is

124
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,560
like a first generation

125
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,560
license plate reader

126
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,279
and as soon as i did this other pictures

127
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,680
emerged through signal through messenger

128
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,240
through various means of communication

129
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,599
people starting sending me pictures of

130
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,720
these license plate readers around the

131
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,320
country

132
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,600
because they started noticing the same

133
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,519
thing that i noticed that there was a

134
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,079
new box in town there's a new thing

135
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,880
that sat on the overpass somewhere and

136
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,040
they were

137
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,399
like these boxes are fairly big i even

138
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,399
brought one here so you can see that

139
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,800
they they're kind of big right so so

140
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,079
they're easy to spot

141
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,680
and they have very characteristics

142
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,399
because they have these dual camera

143
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
system

144
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,320
and then they have the leds in the

145
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,359
middle so it was a very easy thing to

146
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,200
say like you know

147
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,040
look at it at the business side here and

148
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,320
then if you see something like this

149
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,880
please dm me essentially and this was

150
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,839
fairly like rapidly i started getting

151
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
pictures

152
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
and some of the pictures included yellow

153
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,720
labels

154
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,640
so uh rp means listen to national police

155
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:32,480
and pr license plate reader escape

156
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,319
that is a box or something else and then

157
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
it says that this is a type 3

158
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,120
installation so it's interesting to see

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,640
okay they have different types of

160
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,519
installations

161
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,640
um and they have some component numbers

162
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,040
on it as well

163
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,079
but the nice thing as well is that you

164
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,719
you get this

165
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,079
zero six facing y that looks a little

166
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,839
weird

167
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,638
it's it's a name of a place but it

168
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,480
indicates that it's like a site id

169
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,760
so this is a way you can kind of

170
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,839
estimate the upper bound

171
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,200
of how many sites there are like get the

172
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
highest number that was like a famous

173
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,639
german

174
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,240
there's a famous german tank serial

175
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,800
number example if you ever look that up

176
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,600
you know

177
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,719
where the allies tried to uh figure out

178
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
how many german tanks were being

179
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
produced by looking at zero

180
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,279
numbers of tanks that got destroyed and

181
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,040
this is pretty much the same thing since

182
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,800
they have like site ids you can kind of

183
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,399
like okay we have the upper limit of

184
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,359
how many sites we know that are in

185
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,639
production right now essentially

186
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,160
i got a few of these labels and i

187
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,600
specifically asked for these labels to

188
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
try to understand like

189
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,760
how many are there where should we move

190
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
from here

191
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,440
um one thing that is interesting is also

192
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
these

193
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,680
suddenly become like fixtures in the

194
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,800
environment so there was an election

195
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,800
shortly after and i wanted to put a

196
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,719
like my own billboard on there i looked

197
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,560
looked up a lot on the law on what you

198
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,240
can put on election posters

199
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,319
and i could basically if i made an

200
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,920
election poster and put my name on it

201
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,000
i couldn't make it like something saying

202
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,519
like stop

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,120
mass surveillance or something like that

204
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,160
and put it on there and that would be a

205
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,680
valid thing

206
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,040
but then i looked up the rules and

207
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,160
you're not allowed to put it in the

208
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,160
middle of the road because it's too

209
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,360
speed you drive too fast there but

210
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,360
politicians were allowed

211
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,120
okay okay so another approach was like i

212
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,040
kind of knew that this was the police's

213
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,639
stuff i needed to know about more about

214
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,279
it so

215
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,639
i i i sent out afraid of information

216
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,800
requests to the

217
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,000
municipality where this was placed

218
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,680
trying to fly a little bit under the

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,880
radar not going directly to the police

220
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,839
because otherwise they will just block

221
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,000
me up front

222
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
trying to see if i can hit somebody

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,279
who's clueless about this

224
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,279
who doesn't know that this is national

225
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,600
security or perceived to be national

226
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,639
security in some sense

227
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,880
and uh what they said is that they could

228
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,839
talk to risbury and i was not allowed to

229
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,760
know what it was so they were kind of

230
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,880
giving it away that it was belonging to

231
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,399
switzerland but

232
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,079
i can kind of like put two and two

233
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,639
together then right

234
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,439
um and then i said okay please give me

235
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,680
the complete

236
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,480
correspondence uh journal on the file

237
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,439
don't give me all the

238
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,519
files but just like give me uh the index

239
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,480
of your file on this case

240
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,279
and then they they kind of noted this uh

241
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
there was

242
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,240
there was a meeting in city hall where

243
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,480
this was marked on this file

244
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
and then i looked up the minutes from

245
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,600
the meeting and that was public like the

246
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,120
minutes were public on the website

247
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,480
it was just scanned so i couldn't go

248
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,760
through it like i couldn't find it when

249
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,360
i was googling it

250
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,360
but basically it says let the police

251
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
without prior authorization put up a

252
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
license plate reader in the middle of

253
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,518
their street

254
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,880
there's laws that allow the police it's

255
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,320
called the guest principle

256
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,000
it allows the police to push stuff up

257
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,040
like this but they didn't apply for one

258
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,480
thing

259
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,719
and paperwork is very important they

260
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,519
didn't apply for uh digging like to dig

261
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,480
up the road

262
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:47,040
license so i had to do that afterwards

263
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,639
uh after the fact

264
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,719
because i had this i could then go back

265
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,079
to the municipality and say

266
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,560
please give me all the files i know this

267
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,638
is a lpr now you kind of it's public

268
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,680
there's no way to hide it now and then

269
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,680
they the police

270
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,439
sent i got the letter which bully sent

271
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,638
to the municipality said please don't

272
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
let question know about the fact that

273
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,160
this is a

274
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,440
lpr and i got a letter of the

275
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,800
so i think that is fairly funny so i i

276
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,959
played around with moshi and genetic

277
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,000
animals when it came to foil requests

278
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,439
and

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,800
and sometimes it's like um

280
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
you know you get stuff like this

281
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,639
background was just like blacked out

282
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,040
but then i thought okay it's two

283
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,760
municipality entities communicating

284
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,599
together

285
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,240
i'm just gonna ask the other end and

286
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,480
then i got the full mail

287
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,440
um so that is also funny then sometimes

288
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,120
i go by

289
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,240
you know try something completely

290
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,920
different so where they don't think i'm

291
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,040
gonna attack them from right

292
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,199
so one of them is uh go buy invoices

293
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
like i just want to see your invoices

294
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,399
and they are so

295
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,160
so in their head like focused on

296
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,880
questions must not know the price of

297
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,719
this stuff

298
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,480
that they forgot to black out what was

299
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,320
actually sold to them

300
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,680
so if you zoom in it actually tells you

301
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,199
like all the things they did

302
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,079
like the places they put up license

303
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,758
plate readers and stuff like that

304
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,359
that was kind of the material thing that

305
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,199
i wanted but i kind of made a magic

306
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,720
trick by saying invoices and i want to

307
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,000
know like how much does this cost and

308
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,839
then they say you cannot know what this

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
costs because it's secret

310
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,959
but they forgot to black out what i was

311
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,560
actually going for

312
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
so by doing these methods and also

313
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,000
having a lot of people help me out i

314
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,959
want to thank all you anonymous guys out

315
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,759
there who have

316
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,719
contributed photos and also name persons

317
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,800
will i which

318
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
i will not name because i don't know if

319
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,040
i'm allowed to

320
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,399
but thank you for for helping me finding

321
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,560
all these

322
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,560
so this was the map about two years ago

323
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,399
it was really really nice to see how

324
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,359
quickly this came about it took about a

325
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,040
month or two

326
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
and we have mapped out all the scanners

327
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,160
that were suddenly there

328
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,519
um that was extremely nice um

329
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,680
then the police showed uh to

330
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,560
fargating and others that this was a

331
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,719
very good thing

332
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,079
they thought so let's put up some more

333
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,440
and actually

334
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,800
the danish parliament was putting

335
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,839
pressure on the police to put up more

336
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,160
scanners

337
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,360
and now we they since the technology

338
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,720
evolved a little bit

339
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,959
they now put up a second generation

340
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,640
scanner they're a little smaller

341
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,640
they're about half the size of

342
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,360
about about half the size of this bugger

343
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,679
right so if you imagine the lens size

344
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,760
here

345
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,039
and you see up here you kind of see that

346
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,240
they kind of just pulled off

347
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,760
all this extra ir in the middle

348
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,280
that's because the sensitivity of the

349
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,799
cameras got much better and they don't

350
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,799
need that much illumination anymore

351
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,320
since uh this is now caught in in a much

352
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,400
smaller um

353
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,879
size they can now mount them in places

354
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,480
where it's almost impossible to see

355
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,840
so now they get mounted on the bridges

356
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,960
for instance this is a good example this

357
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,360
is on the highway

358
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,720
sorry this is on the highways under the

359
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,439
bridge

360
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,720
and it's it's not even so there's like a

361
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,720
pool sticking up the old

362
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,120
system had the sort of disadvantage that

363
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,200
it was kind of mounted on the side

364
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,360
of overpasses and then people would like

365
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,039
put sticks down and you know

366
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,799
move the cameras not to point at the

367
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,240
road anymore or destroy them

368
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,679
but now since they are under the deck

369
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,679
essentially it's really really hard to

370
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,559
get to so therefore

371
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,320
uh they they are kind of protected from

372
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,000
the environment that way but also

373
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,000
vandalism

374
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,440
so how do i go about finding these new

375
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,600
things because they're not so

376
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,000
like they're not easy to spot anymore

377
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,480
they are kind of hidden away from

378
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,320
um from daily life because they're

379
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,440
sitting there quiet life under

380
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,840
highway underpasses so there are kind of

381
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,440
few

382
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,120
tricks to look up stuff like this and

383
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,120
shenanigans like this so the first one

384
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,120
would be

385
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,280
foia the permits for digging up the road

386
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,600
and i did that a lot so i asked

387
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,799
different municipalities can i please

388
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,918
get the permit that you have for

389
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,440
setting up cameras from this specific

390
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,880
company that was doing this and they

391
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,000
were blacking out all the prices but

392
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,679
they didn't black out the

393
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
plan for where it was so this is

394
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,840
actually the one from closure

395
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,479
the first camera and um and you can kind

396
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,360
of see on

397
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,360
on on

398
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,640
on on the plot here that they even draw

399
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,480
out where the line the power line goes

400
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,480
so it is very nice you can kind of see

401
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,679
where they dug up the road essentially

402
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,440
to place it and they they even fairly

403
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,600
accurately place the direction

404
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,360
and orientation of the cameras so it was

405
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,840
even with complete degrees and how they

406
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,678
should

407
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,120
like be mounted towards the road so

408
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
there's a really good evidence

409
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,959
to say that there's a camera here but

410
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,640
another thing that is really nice about

411
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
this is that because this is like now

412
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,120
we're entering the public domain right

413
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,559
you're digging up the road you need to

414
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,439
coordinate with other people

415
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,600
and stuff like that so uh there's a

416
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,760
register called linux aya register

417
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,159
or the ones that own cables in the

418
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,080
ground register

419
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,440
in for sticking info it's called so it's

420
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,799
a place where you can look up before you

421
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,160
dig a hole in the ground whether it's a

422
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,559
cable

423
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,000
and all these things were actually put

424
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,600
in there because they they were doing

425
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,760
they were first screening whether there

426
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,199
was cables and that puts in an entry and

427
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,640
then they are doing the actual digging

428
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,200
that puts in another entry

429
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,039
so we kind of figure out here and you

430
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,240
can see that this company is called its

431
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,440
technique that's the company that won

432
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
the contract for setting up

433
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,520
these license plate readers and then

434
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
suddenly you have some numbers you can

435
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,879
start forwarding that

436
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,200
getting information another thing

437
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,799
is uh when you need to do road works to

438
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,919
set up cameras you also need to block

439
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,918
the street

440
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,280
and i learned a lot about this is also

441
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,200
one of these you know

442
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,399
going to another rabbit hole right the

443
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
rules of

444
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,760
how to mark a street probably um

445
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,879
it's a thick book and it has all these

446
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,039
nice diagrams

447
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,960
but this diagram is actually from uh

448
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,480
from the glowstop case as well

449
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,080
where it kind of marks the type of block

450
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
that you have to have on the road with

451
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,240
the signaling on it

452
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,360
and what kind of truck it can take and

453
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,840
withstand

454
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,600
basically so like if you're on a street

455
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,559
with a specific speed limit

456
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,600
it needs to be um it needs to have a

457
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,440
certain

458
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,280
stopping power the thing that you put

459
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,480
there so if you ever

460
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,200
if you come here from from the

461
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,480
copenhagen side over the over the bridge

462
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,039
you try to notice the the the things

463
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,320
they have

464
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,120
on on the on the bridge

465
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,720
for stopping cars when if they were

466
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,879
swearing into the lane

467
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,159
it's like big big trucks with large

468
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,840
tanks of water on it

469
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,760
to stop a large truck from hitting

470
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,360
roadside workers essentially

471
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,200
um but you have to submit plans like

472
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,158
this because otherwise it's dangerous to

473
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,640
work on the road but

474
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,760
you can fire you can get a freedom of

475
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,159
information request

476
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,440
out on this and they kind of don't think

477
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
about it but it contains a lot of

478
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
information like who's the one

479
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,799
who's you're doing the work for instance

480
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,799
so it kind of reveals things on the side

481
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,360
anyways

482
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,720
and then if it's on a public sort of

483
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,479
state road

484
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,000
it's actually you have to report it to

485
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,520
write it to other which is the national

486
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,880
authority for the roads it's kind of

487
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,520
like the danish department of

488
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,520
transportation

489
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,360
and this is like just local data like

490
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,400
road closings and

491
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,320
stuff like that in the area here and

492
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,679
you can even see them here like when

493
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,280
they're blocking the road

494
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:20,240
in order to set up this uh equipment

495
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,200
another extremely valuable source is

496
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,799
mapley

497
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,480
i don't know if i couldn't pronounce it

498
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,200
correctly uh

499
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,400
people in the tent here are helping me

500
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,080
quite a lot on that

501
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,039
so it's basically live street view but

502
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,158
updated so it's it's great and it's

503
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,480
it's uh there's so much more

504
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
tracks on it so much more fidelity on it

505
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,559
because

506
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,959
it's uh it's it's brought by volunteers

507
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,240
i think

508
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,600
mostly um and i'm just so happy that i

509
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,440
can i can look up

510
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,678
places where i wanna uh

511
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,520
investigate more on like whether there's

512
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,000
a license plate reader or not

513
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,360
without having to start my car like i i

514
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,960
really enjoy that also because i don't

515
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,080
want to drive you jutland for figuring

516
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,559
out whether there's a license plate

517
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,678
reader

518
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,760
xoya like whether one of these blips on

519
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,799
the roadworks map was actually a license

520
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,799
plate reader that came up

521
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,400
so from this it's kind of like the first

522
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,399
rollout was like this

523
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,799
fairly concentrated in the in sort of

524
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,000
copenhagen

525
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,679
maybe a little bit on the border

526
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
crossings maybe a little bit on like

527
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,640
central points

528
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,880
this was 2017-ish state and then

529
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,080
um just a few years later this is the

530
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,360
situation right now where we have

531
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
license plate readers and this kind of

532
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,879
just

533
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,799
like exploded so

534
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,000
it's still like on the long stretches of

535
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,158
road within denmark

536
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,320
it's not you know it's not every

537
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,400
10 kilometers but probably like every 50

538
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,559
or 100 kilometers you'll need it

539
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,640
if you go by the major roads but then in

540
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,600
border regions and especially

541
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,159
in around copenhagen it's pretty crazy

542
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,360
how much

543
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,120
got up there um

544
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,799
and and it's just been exploding over

545
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,239
the past

546
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,520
few years especially like copenhagen is

547
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
completely surrounded now

548
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,720
like all minor roads as well are

549
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,480
starting to get

550
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,559
these license plate readers all right

551
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,320
so that was the police view like the

552
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,320
police use of license

553
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,600
plate readers and now i'm just going to

554
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,520
move into some other

555
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,360
entities that i've started doing license

556
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,320
traders as well so if you have any

557
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,158
questions right now

558
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,678
just to that part of should we take them

559
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,799
afterwards

560
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,000
okay anything about the police's use of

561
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,559
it

562
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,080
all right otherwise give me a shout

563
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,200
afterwards

564
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,879
so of course that's the anpga black

565
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,080
edition

566
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,440
i'm i can just tell you that it's uh

567
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,799
the national uh police security service

568
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,919
that is setting them up

569
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,600
and they are being put up near

570
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:02,159
places that they protect so it's usually

571
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,719
um it's being put up if you remember

572
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,240
there was a case in in langston where

573
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,919
there was a sort of immediate

574
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,120
threat to the life of um

575
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,159
i think it was some iraq iran iran group

576
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,559
something like that i'm

577
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,520
sorry about the details here but that

578
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,799
that led

579
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,200
uh to a complete chase uh police chase

580
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,120
across

581
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,960
sealand closing down all the bridges and

582
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,158
stuff like that guess what there was one

583
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,679
of these license plate readers just

584
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,200
sitting outside there

585
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,600
it's probably one of the first ones that

586
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,640
gave a hit that this car was stolen that

587
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,879
was a swedish car

588
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,919
stolen a market stolen police radishes

589
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,000
this was sitting

590
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:45,760
right side right outside the house

591
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,559
this one is near kaulinasgon in

592
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,559
northern copenhagen

593
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,720
they are near

594
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,760
they are located near places where pt

595
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,440
the danish police intelligence service

596
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
are protecting people or protecting

597
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,200
property

598
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,879
and these are even more secret of course

599
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,159
than the ones that police have they

600
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,080
you can basically not get any

601
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,679
information about them but one thing

602
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
that is really nice and i think it's

603
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,799
probably extremely stupid of them but

604
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,600
they kind of made them black rather than

605
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,360
white

606
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,719
so it's very easy to see whether this is

607
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,959
something that is meant

608
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
like who owns them it's like black hat

609
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
white hat kind of thing

610
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,840
almost

611
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,440
then other players are starting to move

612
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,039
into this game right and this

613
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
was actually just sent to me while i was

614
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,320
in the parking lot

615
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,919
parking up my car here for one hack that

616
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,840
a newspaper article uh in

617
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,120
and a newspaper in august was saying

618
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,879
like

619
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,879
there's a mystery camera camera and

620
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,960
nobody know who owns it

621
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,640
and it's pretty ironic giving gdpr that

622
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,000
you're required to tell that you're

623
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,799
doing surveillance right

624
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,440
that nobody knows who owns the camera

625
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,440
but somehow

626
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,760
the data protection denmark discounts

627
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,240
information about who

628
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,760
actually operates the cctv i was in

629
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,320
norway for instance and it's

630
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,039
fairly common that all cctv camera signs

631
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,960
also have

632
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,640
like who's the responsible of the

633
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,360
operation under it but

634
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,640
apparently it's too hot in denmark

635
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,158
anyways

636
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,919
so it's interesting to see that it's

637
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,240
also kind of hitting like other people

638
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,000
are noticing these cameras right

639
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,760
and and and this specific camera and

640
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,120
it's nice that they buy different brands

641
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,000
so you know what they like the different

642
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,559
purpose of them

643
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,440
so this one is uh called an pips iris

644
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,520
camera

645
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,480
it's for controlling the environmental

646
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,600
zones in copenhagen

647
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,880
and albo so in in these cities there's a

648
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,799
environmental zone where you're not

649
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,399
allowed to drive your truck into with a

650
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,000
diesel without a diesel

651
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:50,799
particle something filter on you

652
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,480
uh and and you cannot if you go in there

653
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,600
anyways this is the way you get fined

654
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,360
then

655
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,799
so they kind of have to capture the

656
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
license plate so everybody check whether

657
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,600
you are a truck or

658
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,959
if you are like a personal vehicle and

659
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,158
then they have to get rid of the data

660
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
for personal vehicles

661
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,520
and then they have to check the trucks

662
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,080
afterwards to check whether

663
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,399
you actually have paid your dues or if

664
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,399
you have

665
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,158
submitted to these extra filters on your

666
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,520
truck so of course it's great that we

667
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,679
don't have large trucks with like

668
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,200
polluting diesel particles in the city

669
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,120
but whether this is the correct approach

670
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,799
i'm not entirely sure also because it's

671
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,000
not necessarily everywhere these cameras

672
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,760
will be

673
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,360
anyways i i actually saw one of these

674
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,120
cameras also going over the bridge and

675
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,039
that's something that i got i'm gonna be

676
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,239
interested in coming like when i go back

677
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,240
again see if i can spot it

678
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,080
on the other way but it seems that this

679
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,840
camera is more of a

680
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,320
consume like in consumer friendly or

681
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,158
like not necessarily police friendly but

682
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,279
towards no more like normal enterprises

683
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,600
that you can buy license and split

684
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,600
reading

685
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,520
since this is operated by the danish

686
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,960
sona belt

687
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,960
which is a public company

688
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,240
owned by the state they are actually

689
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,158
also under

690
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,440
um of this loan which is the public

691
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,760
records act in denmark

692
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,440
which means that i i asked for a list of

693
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,120
all the sites that they put up so now i

694
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,039
actually got a very nice list from them

695
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,799
they weren't even pushing back on that

696
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,960
so that was nice

697
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,080
um but it shows that if you're a little

698
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,840
bit familiar with

699
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,678
some of the geographies of oh who's

700
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,158
copenhagos and owens

701
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,679
it's not necessarily like omnibus

702
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,679
surveillance right now

703
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,880
but who knows it might change going down

704
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,640
the line that they might put up more

705
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,360
once they realize this will not work in

706
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,159
the end

707
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,840
once they figure out that people will

708
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,520
just drive another way into the city

709
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,439
a funny thing about this is all these

710
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,399
places are places where the police also

711
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,919
have a camera

712
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,239
so now they're kind of you you typically

713
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,120
see

714
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,080
like for instance near uh dumb stream in

715
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,239
copenhagen which is

716
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,000
like a recognizable spot you see two

717
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,640
license plate readers just next to each

718
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,679
other

719
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,200
operated by two different entities

720
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,600
so and there was talks that the bulesis

721
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,440
was

722
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,039
the one that was going to be used to

723
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,679
this first so i think the police set up

724
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,279
the camera

725
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,120
first to bid for this so they could

726
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,080
collect more data upfront

727
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,520
but then it was kind of i think somebody

728
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,678
saw that the wins that it was probably

729
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,600
better to put this in a separate company

730
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,600
to avoid misuse of data

731
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,000
another camera you might see is this one

732
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,640
called siemens psi core

733
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,360
it's it's a also fairly well used in

734
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,679
denmark

735
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,639
there's if you either way you came if

736
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:32,559
you came on highway

737
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,679
here it's uh it's

738
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,760
on sort of on this area of on

739
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,799
on the tekken some wall it's called in

740
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,399
jutland

741
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,639
it's just the immediate area from here

742
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,840
in jutland where the roads are covered

743
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,600
with these cameras

744
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,840
and they'll be used primarily for travel

745
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,520
time measurements so it's an

746
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,199
alternative to bluetooth tracking and

747
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,679
other tracking in order to see

748
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,360
what are the travel times in the area

749
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,080
but they're using these siemens psycho

750
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,678
cameras for this purpose also know that

751
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,039
the municipality of copenhagen uses

752
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,519
these for some

753
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,800
i think some sort of measurements

754
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,840
yeah then there's

755
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,678
[Music]

756
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,879
one camera that i found more that was

757
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,640
also used by

758
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,880
uh waiter torreira which is like the

759
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,600
danish dot

760
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,120
which is called the ca traffic black cat

761
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,799
and they could just say that it was used

762
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,279
for experimental stuff

763
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,240
it didn't seem to be very bad

764
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,880
experimental stuff

765
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,880
but it was more like could they figure

766
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,279
out if people were driving

767
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,919
too many hours in their lorry without

768
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,960
stopping

769
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,600
or stuff like that but it's still like

770
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,840
it's a slippery slope right apart from

771
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,000
that there's

772
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,600
tons of operators now in the private

773
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
domain that are starting to use license

774
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,320
plate readers

775
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,799
across the board it's

776
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,000
it's being used by parking a lot by

777
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,760
parking entities and a lot by

778
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,600
target and parking and parking

779
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,799
enforcement especially like

780
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,719
cities are using it for parking

781
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,879
enforcement and

782
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,480
also if you enter and exit like parking

783
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,679
garages it's being used

784
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,679
at a very high rate now

785
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,159
and i think

786
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,479
uh it is being started to be used

787
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,120
for payments as well so when you cross

788
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,960
the bridge you can pay by plate instead

789
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,120
um they're capturing the applied license

790
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,919
plate anyways even though you don't

791
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,120
pay by plate but they and i guess that's

792
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,399
because they

793
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,719
they want some security if you're

794
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,760
defrauding them by putting like paying

795
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,559
with

796
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,360
a stolen card or something like that so

797
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,678
so that is kind of

798
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,199
the domain of where we are right now and

799
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,240
now i'm gonna focus a little bit

800
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,240
on on this bastard down there

801
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,919
so i've had alerts on ebay for quite a

802
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,519
while

803
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,519
for these cameras because i wanted to

804
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,519
play with them

805
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,880
i think that my main goal the first time

806
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,159
i saw this was i

807
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,600
kind of wanted to enact what the what a

808
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,360
group of artists did once in the uk

809
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,678
where they made a film

810
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,158
based on ccgtv camera so they were kind

811
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,360
of acting in front of ctv cameras

812
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,679
and then they've they asked for the data

813
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,600
on the data protection law got a copy of

814
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,440
the data and then they could use the

815
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,600
that in an artistic for an artistic

816
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,600
purpose i kind of been drawn for having

817
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,760
a selfie with one of these cameras

818
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,719
i kind of wanted to see like what do i

819
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,000
look like to

820
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,600
a license plate reader so i thought okay

821
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,799
the best way would be to see when these

822
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,199
go discounted on on ebay

823
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,120
but i'm i'm a bit cheap sometimes so i

824
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,679
actually just put up a link to mobile

825
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,719
page

826
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,200
on on my twitter feed

827
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,720
and i went to make some food or

828
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,960
something like that and

829
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,880
in a few hours i had enough money to buy

830
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,080
this so i'm actually thank you for

831
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,159
everybody who's uh

832
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,360
who owns this now you can get a

833
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,320
officially signed

834
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,320
um certificate of ownership where you

835
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
can get like your quarter or tenth or

836
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,720
whatever

837
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,559
of the camera if you want so but right

838
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,320
now it's in safe possession with me

839
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,678
but i think it is more of a community

840
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,440
purchase because you all

841
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,800
participated to this um

842
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,480
so the first thing was like i was

843
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,399
waiting for this to go

844
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,480
from some parking lot defunct parking

845
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,598
lot in the us in utah

846
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,639
to come to to copenhagen um or to

847
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,839
albertsland

848
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,639
where i live um and the first thing that

849
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,679
i was kind of

850
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,320
uh trying to figure out was

851
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,839
i need to power this bastard somehow and

852
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,079
i don't know how to power and there's no

853
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,320
manual you can buy the very official

854
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,839
cable from them but they don't document

855
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,919
anything about specs

856
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:43,679
so i was really like looking at manuals

857
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,118
trying to enlarge this stuff

858
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,520
trying to figure out if i can find like

859
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,079
a catalog of connectors so i can buy

860
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,079
that

861
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,000
prior to getting the camera but i was um

862
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,760
there's not enough resolution on it and

863
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,560
some of the pictures that i got were

864
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,400
kind of

865
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,000
counter countering each other whether

866
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,240
which connectors to buy so i needed to

867
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,880
get the damn thing for it

868
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,439
but luckily i got it and here's a man

869
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,720
and he's

870
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,440
very happy that he got a

871
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,959
lpr camera in the in the mail i was like

872
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,800
ecstatic the day that it came in the

873
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,480
mail

874
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,480
i guess you could also just have gone

875
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,079
like gone here with a mask and just

876
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,640
stolen one from the street but i thought

877
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,280
this was a nice thing actually to buy it

878
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,040
um

879
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,599
so so i'm actually happy to to legally

880
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,079
have this camera in my position but i

881
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,440
could find

882
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,599
like now i could take some high

883
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,320
resolution pictures and again it's like

884
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,680
twitter is

885
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,000
awesome and people with speciality in

886
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,200
cables and connectors say you need this

887
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,720
specific plug

888
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,879
and i bought this specific plug and it

889
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,160
came the day after and it fit

890
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,320
so that was wonderful

891
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,440
uh one problem though i don't know what

892
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,599
was what here

893
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,280
like there's no manual on which of the

894
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,359
many pins you do what

895
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,440
so and i didn't just want to go by

896
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,319
random and i knew that some of this was

897
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,160
ethernet so

898
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,400
this was a video signal and some of this

899
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,799
was power but i did not know which was

900
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,880
which

901
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,640
i didn't want to mess around with it too

902
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,359
much

903
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,598
so i had to dissect it

904
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:17,279
so this was like an operating table i

905
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,920
put the kids to bed

906
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,720
and i was laughing manically while i

907
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,480
tried to open the damn thing

908
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,279
first i had to avoid the warranty

909
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,040
sorry about that i was not expecting to

910
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,720
to enjoy that afterwards

911
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,720
and the first thing that came to light

912
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,399
was a very happy site

913
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,399
it runs windows xp embedded

914
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,520
i knew i had struck gold at this point

915
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,520
you know it's what more can i ask for

916
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,359
a windows xp computer that haven't been

917
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,759
patched for 10 years

918
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,160
running inside of an enclosure that is

919
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,520
incredibly hard to get to

920
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:57,520
that is almost as a success

921
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,839
uh for if you ever have to do anything

922
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:02,880
malicious with these cameras right

923
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:05,279
so i got it completely uh and this is uh

924
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,720
sort of an overview of of the internals

925
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,079
of such a camera

926
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,319
one thing that springs to mind is that

927
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,599
it's very kind of

928
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,200
put together by crap right it's

929
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,480
zip tied together and stuff like that a

930
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,359
lot of things look like this on the

931
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,440
inside

932
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:21,200
but this sort of have like this like hot

933
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,160
glue on some connectors that were kind

934
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,720
of forced into

935
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,520
place is this really clearly something

936
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,000
that is like

937
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,240
second or third generation prototype

938
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,720
style that they put into production

939
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,680
uh specifically some of the the stuff

940
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,118
going down

941
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,279
in the south part of this picture with

942
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,320
the number label on it

943
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,960
they were really forced in there with um

944
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,680
with connectors and it kind of looked

945
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,320
like

946
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,598
you you had some sort of lab setup that

947
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,520
you're just trying to minimize a little

948
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,520
bit and put on the bench and then make a

949
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,079
lot of money on that lab setup and then

950
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
go

951
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,839
for the new generation as you sold

952
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,560
before uh when you start pushing into

953
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:59,119
the

954
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,320
mass market but i can maybe give you a

955
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,000
little bit of a tour

956
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,440
to what's going on here if you're

957
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,240
interested

958
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,119
so in the and sorry about using the trim

959
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,319
business and all the

960
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,400
all the time but it's kind of where all

961
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,880
the magic happens right on on the front

962
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,680
here

963
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,280
you have led panels uh you have what's

964
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,040
called a context camera it's just a

965
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,079
standard

966
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:25,200
hga camera and then there is a

967
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,400
high frame rate uh extremely light

968
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,200
sensitive

969
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,359
lpr camera and it's just a basic

970
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,560
standard it's called the bassler

971
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,400
it's a it's something you use for

972
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,119
scientific stuff it's stuff you use it

973
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,240
in

974
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:41,040
if you ever have like um assembly line

975
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,560
or if you have some production facility

976
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,800
where you need to do like

977
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,480
a quality control with images stuff like

978
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,359
that is like it's built for taking

979
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,160
pictures day

980
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,680
out and day out and it feeds via

981
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,799
firewire

982
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:58,480
into a capture port

983
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,200
so you see the two two

984
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,320
pcbs that are yellow on top they feed

985
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:05,439
into a capture

986
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,880
uh card basically so these digitize

987
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,480
the video so there there's a video input

988
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,400
so you can have another camera on it

989
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,040
sitting on this connector and then you

990
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,040
have the context camera puts in this

991
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,520
video and then you have a firewire card

992
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,200
for the digital video stream from the

993
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:28,400
um uh yeah from from the

994
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:31,279
sort of high resolution camera um

995
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,040
and then there is some on-board digital

996
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,040
signal processing because the cpu is not

997
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,079
that powerful so they do a lot of

998
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,960
dsp on the board itself before they put

999
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,320
it off to

1000
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,359
to the main cpu so i'm not sure maybe i

1001
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,560
will go to a

1002
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,480
place where we can see the mainstream

1003
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,200
view board um

1004
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,640
it's a it's the big green thing but if

1005
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,480
you turn around on the back side it's

1006
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,279
much more interesting

1007
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,200
um it's basically an industrial pc so

1008
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,560
it's like a

1009
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,560
completely standard industrial pc

1010
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,279
it has a some connectors that are like

1011
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,279
ethernet and

1012
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,839
usb and power and sound and stuff like

1013
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,880
that

1014
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:16,400
so with this i could kind of because the

1015
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,440
the industrial pc it's it's a very

1016
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,240
common i think thing is called like pc

1017
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,200
at 106 or something like that which is a

1018
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:26,319
very standard

1019
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,919
industrial pc form factor and board you

1020
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,359
could kind of reverse engineer all

1021
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,119
connections to that

1022
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,799
and then you could kind of from there

1023
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,599
reverse engineer connections to

1024
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,880
the plug figuring out like which plug is

1025
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,359
the

1026
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,240
tx rx on the ethernet which ones are

1027
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,720
power

1028
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,759
whereas ground was video signals and

1029
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,200
stuff like that

1030
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,800
so that got mapped out and then there

1031
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,118
was a little bit of synanogen so there's

1032
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,119
like

1033
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,640
two different ways you can power it and

1034
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,599
it's something to do with some failure

1035
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,598
with batteries

1036
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,960
but a lot of people were very nice to

1037
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,720
explain what was going on

1038
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,040
on twitter with me and i was kind of

1039
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,040
probing while taking pictures and

1040
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,200
got helped out and the other thing is i

1041
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,240
had to dig in my

1042
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,680
in my stuff like who uses these huge

1043
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,720
cards anymore right

1044
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,598
who uses um uh i

1045
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,359
was called compact flash cards anymore

1046
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,960
so i had to find a compact flash reader

1047
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,560
in my junk bin somewhere

1048
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,079
it took me like that was probably what

1049
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,319
took me the longest like

1050
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,680
i think two days to find it but anyways

1051
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,720
i found that and then i could dump the

1052
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,560
sd card

1053
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,959
i have the sd card as a gzip file so if

1054
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,400
you

1055
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,240
want to play around with the file system

1056
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,760
at some point you can do that

1057
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,279
but you can also just go to the website

1058
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,720
and download a software update and it's

1059
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,359
pretty much the same

1060
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,959
so all the stuff that is interesting is

1061
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,440
in a zip file on the website

1062
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,960
so just have to look at the right place

1063
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,240
anyways i could power this up and then i

1064
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,440
could do the first selfie and that was

1065
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,439
kind of like yay

1066
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,720
yeah so that was awesome um

1067
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,200
and you see the pink light from the ir

1068
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,000
leds there in the front

1069
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,759
um and this is the picture so this is

1070
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,680
from the context camera and this is from

1071
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,040
the lpr camera the one with the

1072
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,040
where i'm really lit up in the face

1073
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,200
um i brought it here with me so if you

1074
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,599
want to play around with it

1075
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,240
um i thought of two things that you can

1076
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,599
do to it

1077
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,118
to attack the thing you can take it on

1078
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,560
the network side and you could attack it

1079
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,400
on the optics side

1080
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,319
i think that attacking it on the optic

1081
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,119
side is the nicest thing

1082
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,800
uh and i would i'm gonna leave it here

1083
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,240
at the camp and i hope that somebody's

1084
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,880
gonna play around with it and try to see

1085
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,540
if you can

1086
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,079
try to fuss it um

1087
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,079
[Music]

1088
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,760
i don't remember the password for it

1089
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,560
anymore i don't remember anything for it

1090
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,760
so it's

1091
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,599
it's standard passwords that are in

1092
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,079
manuals around on the internet so you

1093
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,839
can probably

1094
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,520
you can probably hook up to it and

1095
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,359
figure out how to get to it but it's

1096
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,960
also a windows xp machine so i'm sure

1097
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:49,200
that you can exploit it

1098
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,240
um through rdp it runs rdp for instance

1099
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,240
so that should be

1100
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,359
fairly simple to do but play around with

1101
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,919
it if you want to

1102
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:58,640
uh i consider this as a community thing

1103
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,880
it's not mine it's like yours and ours

1104
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,400
so i'm not gonna hold on to it forever

1105
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,000
so if you have some interesting projects

1106
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,319
where you want to play with it

1107
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,720
uh this is now in all our hands one

1108
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,160
thing that i was playing with

1109
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,919
was trying to defeat the on the optic

1110
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,680
side so i have like a few ideas that i

1111
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,880
haven't gotten around to materialize in

1112
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,319
my head yet

1113
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,319
but there was like two things that i

1114
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:24,160
thought of one was blinding it

1115
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,920
and one was trying to obfuscate your car

1116
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,839
so it couldn't figure out the license

1117
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,760
plate obviously getting your car so you

1118
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,520
cannot figure out the license plate

1119
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,960
might make your car look really ugly and

1120
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,040
you might get into

1121
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,640
a conflict with some of the legislation

1122
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,920
around license plates which says that

1123
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,440
you cannot put something on your car

1124
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,040
that looks like a license plate

1125
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,200
but you can probably put some banners or

1126
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,520
other stuff on there that will confuse

1127
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,118
the algorithms and i would invite

1128
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,119
everybody to try to do that of course

1129
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,279
sadly i didn't have time to do it to to

1130
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,040
set up a test setup because otherwise

1131
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,079
that would be like a fun thing to do

1132
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:58,480
um maybe next year or somebody wants to

1133
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,240
do it

1134
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,079
um the other thing was blinding it and

1135
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,118
then and i thought that uh that was

1136
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,000
probably the best

1137
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,200
tactic trying to you know shine strong

1138
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,880
ir light

1139
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,560
from like around your license plate not

1140
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,640
on your license plate which is like

1141
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,400
having like a frame around your license

1142
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,520
plate with ir light that is not like

1143
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,960
human visible

1144
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,640
but we're really really strong like

1145
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,920
beefy chinese

1146
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,359
led 10 watt leds right so i was playing

1147
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,920
a bit around with it and

1148
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,279
um i was filming it and i don't know if

1149
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,839
you can see that

1150
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,440
it kind of blacks out on one side here

1151
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,119
and uh

1152
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,480
i don't show the video here but it's

1153
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,359
actually it has like a rolling shot

1154
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,720
effect

1155
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,400
and i was trying to look out what's

1156
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,720
going on there that's like a some sort

1157
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,560
of

1158
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,399
frequency to this light so it's

1159
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,759
that was interesting to me at least and

1160
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,440
kind of a downturn

1161
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,560
on my side because that means that it's

1162
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,160
kind of bursting light at specific times

1163
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,920
and then the other thing is that if you

1164
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,200
look at the camera and this is the

1165
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,119
camera if you want to look that up it's

1166
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,078
called the sca1300g

1167
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,440
32gm that's the bezel camera but it has

1168
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,520
a spectral response

1169
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,359
that is not very good in the ara domain

1170
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,839
that means that it's actually better for

1171
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,640
daylight like now so if you're trying to

1172
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:13,680
avoid

1173
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,118
the camera by blinding it during the day

1174
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,839
it's almost impossible

1175
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,560
so you really have to go blinding it at

1176
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,920
night

1177
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,839
that's the only possibility you have

1178
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,760
otherwise the sun is just too strong

1179
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,119
cannot really blind the camera from

1180
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,480
there

1181
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,560
so one thing that i rigged up trying to

1182
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,839
figure out this signal

1183
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,839
was just rigging up like a small

1184
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:35,279
meteor bug thing that i tried to like

1185
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,400
read out data like

1186
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,839
phk did some articles on how you

1187
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,839
you read out data from your meter and i

1188
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,400
wanted to do the same

1189
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:46,480
and i had this lying around so it was

1190
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,599
rigged up to detect ira light it's just

1191
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,319
like

1192
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,760
uh ir serial but i just hooked up one of

1193
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,359
the lines to my scope

1194
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,880
and there you can kind of see the period

1195
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,160
of the burst so even though it's

1196
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,760
negative it's just because it's

1197
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,560
conducting

1198
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,240
so it's conducting when the light is

1199
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,880
hitting the sensor that's why it's

1200
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,879
jumping down

1201
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:12,640
and you can see that time period is 820

1202
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,078
microseconds so that is the amount of

1203
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,598
time that actually illuminates the

1204
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,520
target

1205
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,040
and the rest of the time it's dark and

1206
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,599
you can kind of see here the spikes that

1207
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,240
they go

1208
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,000
that's it's a it's it's very long

1209
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,759
between but the nice thing about this is

1210
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,880
that it's synchronized and i could

1211
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,040
check this out by doing like

1212
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,720
multi-channel on the screen on it itself

1213
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,880
is synchronized to the frame rate of the

1214
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,879
camera just like every time that it

1215
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,400
like the every time the shutter goes to

1216
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,880
take a picture

1217
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,920
it it like bursts out an rr signal so

1218
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,200
you can actually

1219
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,480
detect a lpr cameras that have this

1220
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,919
style of sensors

1221
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,319
just by the signature if you have

1222
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,200
something that have like a rapid pulse

1223
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,400
of ir um that's because it's

1224
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,680
synchronized to the frame rate of the

1225
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,520
camera so every time you want to take a

1226
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,399
picture it's kind of like

1227
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,160
light bulbs right and there's some

1228
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,720
fairly beefy caps in there so if you

1229
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,879
open it up

1230
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,839
be careful because they they store a lot

1231
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,200
of power

1232
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:09,680
and they over they run the leds

1233
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,879
in in the extreme overpower mode to make

1234
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,399
these bursts

1235
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,800
but because they only do it so shortly

1236
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,560
the lifetime is not hampered

1237
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,400
by the camera because they they can cool

1238
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,400
it during during this whole

1239
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,400
cold cycle essentially yeah

1240
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:32,078
yep

1241
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:36,720
[Applause]

1242
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,720
we still have the 10 minutes or

1243
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,839
almost

1244
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,359
it's not very technical you know you

1245
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,760
just ask for things you know

1246
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:12,078
the way you do it normally with normal

1247
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,079
wording

1248
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,160
yeah sometimes it's you can put some

1249
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,599
keywords in there that will trigger

1250
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,040
things but

1251
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,520
generally i just try to use my own

1252
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,640
language when doing this stuff

1253
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,160
because if you do like if you go if they

1254
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:30,078
if you go too technical they might not

1255
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,839
understand it just try to

1256
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,839
imagine who's on the other side

1257
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,559
yeah uh so it seems that besides you

1258
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:06,720
doing this

1259
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,559
kind of public investigation there's

1260
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,598
another youtuber like the

1261
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,800
anaco capitalist last cop

1262
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:17,680
he also likes to criticize these

1263
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,079
he does it in a slightly different way

1264
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,919
uh

1265
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,480
it seems that your effort is aimed

1266
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:27,440
towards documenting what's going on

1267
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,440
and his motto was how to destroy them

1268
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,598
i wonder if there's uh like what's a

1269
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,440
good uh

1270
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,599
i mean besides documenting what's even

1271
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,319
going on is there any effort towards

1272
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,160
uh actually using this information

1273
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:44,800
towards

1274
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:47,920
kind of addressing the issues

1275
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,839
so i i think that like my approach

1276
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,520
is about curiosity and understanding

1277
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:53,359
things like i don't want to criticize

1278
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,440
things that i don't understand like

1279
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,359
i really need to understand them what

1280
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,520
i'm against like i'm

1281
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,040
this is what's driving me all the time

1282
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,559
like i'm curious and i want to

1283
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,079
understand why things are working the

1284
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,960
way they are

1285
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,119
and by that it will enlighten you to

1286
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,640
have a political debate on it

1287
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,720
there might be different approaches in

1288
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,400
the political or anarchos space on how

1289
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,799
to handle this

1290
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,960
i am probably more of a traditionalist

1291
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,079
in terms of like democratic discourse

1292
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:26,079
um so like i i wouldn't

1293
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:29,760
destroy a camera right personally um

1294
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,720
so but i i see it as some sort of sense

1295
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,040
that that people

1296
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,160
are starting to develop on these issues

1297
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,000
that

1298
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,240
me by informing people about this they

1299
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,760
can draw their own sort of

1300
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,959
reasoning about it and also have an

1301
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,440
enlightened debate otherwise i think

1302
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,200
that

1303
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,040
if we are it's too easy to dismiss an

1304
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,399
argument if you are

1305
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,000
being if you're if you're acting without

1306
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,520
information essentially like if you're

1307
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,160
acting without any

1308
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,119
concrete information about the threat

1309
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,759
then

1310
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,280
you'll be shown in part by the ones who

1311
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,880
have the information so i think it's

1312
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,559
more of an equalizer

1313
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,240
to ensure that we're all aware of what's

1314
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,760
going on on a technical level as well

1315
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,558
and how that can be defeated and how it

1316
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,400
works and

1317
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:11,920
how things are interconnected and then

1318
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,079
we can start a debate from there and we

1319
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,440
can also of course do other things but

1320
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,440
it's not necessarily my domain to do

1321
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:33,839
that so no more questions

1322
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:33,839
that's it
