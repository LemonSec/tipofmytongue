1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
foreign

2
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:23,840
hello yeah so what's going on

3
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,639
awesome and thank you for

4
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,280
joining me here for the first

5
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,320
presentation of this bonhack

6
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,599
so i'll um i'll try to give a little

7
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,199
sort of look into the

8
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
batches that we've been doing for the

9
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,320
past five years in in

10
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,000
here at bonak and uh going a little

11
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,960
deeper on this year's batch

12
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,320
what's on it some of the production

13
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,039
stuff of

14
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,240
what happened and the little

15
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,240
nitty-gritty nerdy things

16
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,599
so first yeah go go through all the

17
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,360
little history of batches we have here

18
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,400
we have sort of a mini

19
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,520
sort of uh anniversary with the fifth

20
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,120
edition of bonhack and then

21
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,680
look into some of the ideas and the

22
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,560
plans for the batch of this year

23
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,400
and then what actually ended up being in

24
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,479
the batch for this year

25
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:31,039
and then close up with a look at

26
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,039
how patches like these are made

27
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,080
also yeah due to the how it ended up

28
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
being made

29
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,758
there's a little more information that

30
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,680
you normally would get in

31
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,680
in production so the mini history um

32
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000
most of the batches we have had has been

33
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,520
sort of focused on being relatively

34
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,479
simple so that most people if they sort

35
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,880
of wanted to

36
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,080
figure out and sort of understand how

37
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
the badge works

38
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,359
they could go in and look at it and it

39
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,120
wouldn't be like too complicated

40
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,880
it would be simple things connected to

41
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,080
each other

42
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,280
and try to put it in sort of in a way

43
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,400
where it could

44
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,318
be understood and sort of

45
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,120
fairly deep because many of these

46
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,080
electronics things they are

47
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,360
for some there is a black box and and

48
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,199
there's something you use you put some

49
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,080
software in and something comes out

50
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,840
um but but on the level of these patches

51
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,599
you can actually go in and actually

52
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,919
figure out the whole thing and

53
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,440
how stuff is on the little nitty-gritty

54
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,440
things under registers and

55
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,800
so on that that's that's possible on

56
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,039
many of these and

57
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,639
not an undoable task

58
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,159
another thing is that these patches

59
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,840
shouldn't be too expensive

60
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,639
we are still sort of a smaller hacker

61
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,198
camp uh we need sponsors to

62
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,879
to pay for some of these things um and

63
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,240
we don't have like an

64
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,240
unlimited budget so to to play with so

65
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
trying to sort of keep them within a

66
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,199
reason

67
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
so we don't spend like all the ticket

68
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,479
money on just a badge we

69
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
also need like toilets and all the other

70
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,639
things and speakers

71
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,960
and so on so we need to be manageable in

72
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,960
price

73
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,599
and one of the things that we've been

74
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,758
using is basically for the past uh

75
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,680
this year and the past three years uh

76
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,560
whereas off we can write software on the

77
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,240
batch

78
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,599
um we've been sort of inspired by the

79
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,840
demo scene thing where we have

80
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,039
like a limited set of resources you have

81
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,638
like 8k

82
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,800
or 128k or whatever sort of limited

83
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,919
stuff you can put in and there's like a

84
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,320
border you can't

85
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,159
expand that it's it's what's there and

86
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
then do the best we can with that

87
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,279
that's been sort of one of the ideas and

88
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,519
having these

89
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,039
fairly small processors fairly small

90
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,159
microcontrollers they're still 32-bit

91
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,920
and so on but

92
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,279
they're still in this small range where

93
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,040
i'm measuring

94
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,160
normally missing flash in kilobytes and

95
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,160
so on not in megabytes

96
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:00,320
so the first batch of bonneck was

97
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,319
very simple it was um

98
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,839
there was no microcontroller on there

99
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,640
there was just a

100
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,399
used battery and then a few normal

101
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,240
electronic components uh

102
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,680
it's also it's a little circuit known as

103
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
dual thief where you can

104
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,079
boost the voltage of a used double a

105
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,518
battery that's usually on the

106
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,320
0.8 volts uh maybe 0.5 as it's really

107
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,959
used

108
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,480
you can boost that voltage up enough to

109
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,560
light up a little led you can use it as

110
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,480
a flashlight in your tent or you can

111
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,680
um that was sort of the first batch it

112
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,519
was very cheap to make

113
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,680
it was very quick to make because i had

114
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,279
made similar circuits before

115
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,439
so it was actually sort of a surprise

116
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,000
thing nobody actually knew that would be

117
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
a badge except for me and a few others

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,279
so that was a fun thing there it was

119
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
mostly a soaring exercise people had to

120
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,760
saw it themselves

121
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,120
it's fairly easy but if you're not used

122
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,040
to it and don't

123
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,959
it's it's a little sort of new

124
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,920
experience in that area

125
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,199
um there was some sort of prototyping

126
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,760
area on the badge

127
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,360
and but only like i think a few maybe

128
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,120
one or two people actually sort of took

129
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,440
advantage of that

130
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,160
it looked like this um we used the uh

131
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,480
logo from uh with uh on holland island

132
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,959
uh

133
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
as the main feature on it and then there

134
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,319
was a little led that could

135
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,519
point in different directions and it

136
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,120
could either be on your name or

137
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,200
something so it also had the

138
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,200
name tag feature on the badge

139
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
even the little coil you had to wind

140
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,040
that yourself so it was like a really

141
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,279
diy project

142
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:38,000
for the 2017 match um

143
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,279
we went to a microcontroller based

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,880
platform it's the same that we've been

145
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,240
using for a few years now

146
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,480
um one of the main features we put on on

147
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,040
this one was that esme he wrote a

148
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,079
awesome bootloader that made programming

149
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,399
this batch

150
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,560
much easier than many other electronics

151
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,120
you didn't need the programming

152
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,839
extra programming circuit to do it it

153
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,160
was just a

154
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,120
usb plug-in shows up master always write

155
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,680
your files uh

156
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,760
down to there and then you you're going

157
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,239
and had new firmware on it

158
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,360
we had a little led oled led screen on

159
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,079
it

160
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:17,680
and the the production of this batch was

161
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,519
uh the sweatshop style in levitate we

162
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
saw yeah we can make hundred and

163
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,560
two hundred each batches uh we can do

164
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,680
that by ourselves

165
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,040
um time was a little limited we tried it

166
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,000
and then

167
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,480
we also succeeded everybody got a badge

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,519
um

169
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,000
but it's a lot of work and when you

170
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,920
haven't

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,519
done this before it takes some practice

172
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,240
to put the stencil correctly

173
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,959
and when it gets smudges you have to fix

174
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,959
stuff afterwards

175
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,719
this is how the badge looked it had a

176
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,839
little 128 by 64. i think

177
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,320
oled screen had two buttons

178
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,000
for four buttons for navigation somebody

179
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,720
wrote a little snake game i think

180
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,920
there was some star field animation

181
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,079
stuff

182
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,399
there was some physic animation where

183
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,399
there's a dual pendulum stuff

184
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,440
people managed to go in and hack that

185
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,800
and write some

186
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,839
code on it this wall c based um

187
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,359
but uh it was fun to see people actually

188
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,360
digging in and just

189
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,959
the the software angle is sort of i

190
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,519
think many people here will

191
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,839
will have somewhat ease of getting into

192
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,839
that

193
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,439
so for 2018

194
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,319
we need to do more and other things so

195
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,440
this was

196
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,320
had a focus on the radio communication

197
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,800
we looked at the bbc micro bits and they

198
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,079
have a bluetooth low energy on there

199
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,839
and that was a lot of the circuit that

200
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,920
we sort of took and

201
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,920
put on on the batch here in combination

202
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,959
with the heavy gecko that we had from

203
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,839
the previous year

204
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,518
esme wrote a bootloader that could flash

205
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,240
the

206
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,160
bluetooth cortex m0

207
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,760
via the usb the same controller and so

208
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,920
on

209
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,519
there was no screen on this patch you

210
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,380
could add one yourself if you wanted to

211
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,600
but

212
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,720
[Music]

213
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,720
some people seems to that the the very

214
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,880
limited ui

215
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,200
might have been a lot of hindering in

216
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,880
making

217
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,360
quick hacks and and getting something to

218
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,040
blinking uh

219
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,279
these patches were assembled in china

220
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,560
that was the first ones we had where

221
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,560
we just got fully uh assembled pcbs with

222
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,319
surface mount components on there

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,599
it went very smoothly it's actually the

224
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,620
pcb way that was

225
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,880
the sponsor for this patch they um

226
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,199
[Music]

227
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,240
they actually contacted us uh and said

228
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,839
okay we can help

229
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,600
with doing that and and they actually

230
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
did a great job uh

231
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,920
um even in a somewhat limited time they

232
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,439
actually managed to get the badges uh

233
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,360
out to us in in in good time so we

234
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
the battery holders were soldered on by

235
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,519
some volunteers at the camp

236
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,319
uh very awesome um but that was the only

237
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,959
sort of

238
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
post receiving them production we had to

239
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,000
do and that was sort of a nice

240
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,519
flow um so the

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,040
the antenna for the bluetooth actually

242
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,519
goes up in the little antenna on the

243
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,880
badge

244
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,440
uh it's just a tiny trace and it seems

245
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,120
to work

246
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
fairly okay i think some of the ponies

247
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,920
guys had the communication between two

248
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,199
tents and so on

249
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,199
so uh so that was that was fun

250
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
same bootloader as the the one used for

251
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,479
them for the previous

252
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,199
year and then last year

253
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,959
uh the screen thing seems to be a topic

254
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,560
people like so we put a

255
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,560
20 to a 240 by 240 pixel full color leds

256
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,680
uh

257
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,079
tft ips screen on it it had a lot of

258
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,920
pixels

259
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,920
so we also kind of had to put an sd card

260
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,199
on because the little happy gecko has

261
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,199
very little limited

262
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,319
memory so if you want to actually have

263
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,439
images on the screen

264
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,160
you need to store them somewhere

265
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
we kept with the same controller and

266
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,399
started

267
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
experimenting with infrared

268
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,720
communications to sort of have

269
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,839
some batch to batch communication i

270
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
needed to

271
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,959
i should have looked more into that

272
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,000
because it worked really well

273
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,920
really bad it was like this much

274
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,160
distance you could communicate on uh

275
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,920
otherwise it wouldn't really sort of

276
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,000
um receive the data correctly um

277
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,599
these patches were also assembled in

278
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,760
china but

279
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,920
i kind of screwed up a few things and

280
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,920
those things had to be fixed when we

281
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,160
received the badges so the production

282
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,279
went actually pretty nicely

283
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,759
but the the work afterwards

284
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,240
was a lot of work there was a whole

285
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,519
group of volunteers mostly from holland

286
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,079
and uk

287
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,000
that did a great job in having this

288
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,479
sweatshop on site

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
and fixing i think a total of 400 badges

290
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,519
that was a

291
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,040
awesome job there but ideally we

292
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,199
we shouldn't have that sort of things on

293
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,279
site

294
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:03,680
this was the badge shaped as the

295
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,959
yoda light lightsaber in the star wars

296
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,920
theme

297
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:11,040
all the main components are sort of

298
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,040
hidden behind the screen

299
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,079
so now we're moving to so this year's

300
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,199
batch

301
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,199
taking some of the

302
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,519
experiences from the previous batch

303
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
productions and so on and how people use

304
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,360
them in

305
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,560
and and trying to figure out okay what

306
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,120
what would be nice to have on the badge

307
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,880
some things were like something that

308
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,959
resembles the screen

309
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,360
something you can see something put text

310
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,599
on it put some graphics uh

311
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,959
put blinky stuff that would be nice to

312
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,320
have

313
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,000
and also right now this

314
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,240
whole spring and summer it's been a

315
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
little a little different i guess for

316
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,480
most people

317
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,399
and maybe trying to see if we can get

318
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,040
some of that into the batch also that

319
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,079
would be

320
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,920
fun and the plan is to

321
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,120
have as much as this bad machine

322
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,559
produced

323
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,400
so that we don't have to have these

324
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,280
sweatshops and and doing a lot of

325
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,280
assembly afterwards

326
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,039
and then having it really really really

327
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,319
easy to

328
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,799
get started with just jumping in

329
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,438
writing some codes writing that that

330
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,160
sort of

331
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,559
process should be as easy as as possible

332
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,439
to

333
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,579
to get as most people to to hack on the

334
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,679
badge and do their own

335
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,080
[Music]

336
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,640
little designs and customize the best to

337
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,520
their own liking

338
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
originally we we went with risc five

339
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,120
processor and

340
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,960
we found this gd32 vf103

341
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,719
it's a clone of uh it's a variant of a

342
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,160
clone they did of an st

343
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,480
chip in a factory in china

344
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,840
and it looks pretty good you can get

345
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
some dev kits from

346
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,039
seed studio and i have also managed to

347
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,200
actually get some chips loose chips

348
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,400
it was via tao bao and super buy in

349
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
china and

350
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
it was a little hassle and and took a

351
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
while um

352
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,000
but we actually managed to get a little

353
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,200
dev kits and put something together and

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,840
um esme had wrote a bunch of code to it

355
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,120
and then

356
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,879
actually made it pretty neat but

357
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,239
getting these chips when i called the

358
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,720
factory and said oh

359
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,760
we need to get these chips and if they

360
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,200
could help solve them

361
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,760
and the answer was just no they couldn't

362
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,880
so making a badge and having a sample in

363
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
china without

364
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,799
being able to get the chip was a little

365
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,000
too much for

366
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:39,440
at least for me this year so we ended up

367
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,170
doing a

368
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,360
setup with a sam d21

369
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,960
[Music]

370
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,360
it's a chip i've been playing a little

371
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,640
with before so and getting in the chip

372
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,199
is just like

373
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,240
asking digikey or something similar to

374
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,600
just ship it

375
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,840
and you have it two days later that

376
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,879
that's sort of a little easier to get

377
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,320
your hands on

378
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,039
and then we've gone with circuit python

379
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,520
on the chip

380
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,440
because this jib is there's already sort

381
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,240
of support for the circuit python on the

382
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,840
chip

383
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,400
there are many other boards that already

384
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,159
use this chip and circuit python

385
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,880
the chip is very similar to the happy

386
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,880
gecko it has

387
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,760
the same sort of usb interface built in

388
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,400
has a crystal less operation so you

389
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,720
don't need

390
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
external crystals keeping the component

391
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,600
down

392
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,000
component countdown on the on the badge

393
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
a little bit

394
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,200
the other sort of the main feature on

395
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,720
this patch

396
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,320
is a lot of leds so you can do either

397
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
blinky or you can do text you can use it

398
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,520
as a screen it's only like

399
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,880
9 pixel by 32 pixels um

400
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,480
which is of course a limitation but

401
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,440
let's have a look back to the demo scene

402
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,520
thing

403
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,520
where having a limited scope view

404
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,000
i think many of you will be able to do

405
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,520
awesome and very interesting stuff

406
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,919
uh with this setup all the leds are

407
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,158
driven by two led controllers

408
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,679
uh each of the elite controllers takes

409
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,720
off half of the batch

410
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,760
so 144 leds in in in one half of it and

411
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,200
there are 144 in there i have

412
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,480
they are controlled via square c they

413
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,760
have two different addresses so they're

414
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,919
on the same bus

415
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,120
um but in the circuit python code you

416
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,200
can have them as either

417
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,639
these you have them at two displays and

418
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
then you can sort of with a frame buffer

419
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,600
you can do some little

420
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,678
fiddly so it works as one large screen

421
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,439
these uh little chips can actually store

422
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,280
eight frames in the chip

423
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,720
um so you if you have like a simple

424
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,600
animation you can have these eight

425
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,760
frames stored

426
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,280
and you just need to sort of flip the

427
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,280
which frame is displayed

428
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,799
and the chip will do that so uh so

429
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,559
that's that's one way of

430
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,158
offloading some of the load off on the

431
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,080
main processor if you want to do other

432
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,919
weird stuff or infrared or something

433
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,399
with that

434
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,080
so that's sort of the the next thing is

435
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,960
take two on the infrared

436
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,480
uh hopefully getting this to work on on

437
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,280
longer distances than these tiny little

438
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,000
ones

439
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,480
um so we have an infrared led that can

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,840
emit

441
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,600
signals um that is this year driven by a

442
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,000
transistor so you can have the

443
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,799
current going through the led way higher

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,799
uh it's not

445
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,320
that much higher but it's it's it's more

446
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,440
than what the pin on the controller can

447
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,760
handle

448
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,679
and the receiver side is a complete

449
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,720
module that has

450
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,400
ambient light compensation so that

451
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,200
they will likely work both indoor and

452
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,520
outdoor ish

453
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,799
and also it has the decoding of these

454
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,960
38k

455
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,480
signals that that normally used with

456
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,200
with invert at

457
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,200
receivers and transmitters so it should

458
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,960
also work with many little remotes that

459
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,000
you have for

460
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,600
tvs or whatever stuff

461
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,600
you use ir for

462
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,880
and so similar to many of the the the

463
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,240
previous battery we have this little

464
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,159
gaming thing because i think

465
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,520
on on a screen this size on a little

466
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,679
handheld device

467
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,480
some sort of games i guess this uh is an

468
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,440
obvious thing to put on there i would

469
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
really like to see

470
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,200
tetris uh tetris running on this curved

471
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,360
display going down

472
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
and it could be a fun thing to to see

473
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,918
that running

474
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,360
these are directly connected to the pins

475
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,039
on the mic controller so you can do a

476
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,280
normal effect should be fairly easy to

477
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,280
use

478
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
so in to to boost the the flash that is

479
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,120
on

480
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
the micro tutorial directly we've added

481
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,678
a

482
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,840
little four megabytes spy flash

483
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,520
that's enough to keep a bunch of circuit

484
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,080
python libraries you can have maybe a

485
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,760
little graphic files

486
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,480
there's on the batch right now there's a

487
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,559
little font uh bitmap font loaded on

488
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,280
there also

489
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,399
and it when you plug the batch in this

490
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,240
four megabytes

491
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
the spy flash will show up as your mass

492
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,799
storage device and that's where you save

493
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,199
the files

494
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,559
that's also where the code.pi file is is

495
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,320
located

496
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,639
of course the four megabytes is small

497
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,639
compared to the

498
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,400
to the sd card sizes that you normally

499
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,000
would use but

500
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,159
with the screen size on this batch i

501
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,600
don't think you will need like

502
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,600
gigabytes of flash storage

503
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,960
one other change we did this year is we

504
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,760
went with a usbc connector

505
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
i think many mobile phones and computers

506
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,600
have

507
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,120
been moving towards that um and

508
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,439
these connectors have been sort of going

509
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,120
down in price this is a limited pin

510
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,039
count connector so we don't have the

511
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,320
the high speed connections that is used

512
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,000
for usb3 and so on

513
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,600
but the controller can't handle that in

514
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,200
any way but

515
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,678
the sbu2 one and two that's the sideband

516
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,159
use

517
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,159
pins that are in the connector um those

518
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,159
are actually connected to the chip

519
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,000
so if you want to have like a batch to

520
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,880
batch wired communication

521
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,679
a fully populated usb-c cable should be

522
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,039
able to

523
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,600
to hook those two up um so if you run

524
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,879
like a

525
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,840
uart rx tx stuff um if

526
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
you get it mixed up you can just flip

527
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,959
the

528
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,120
usbc connect on one one end you can just

529
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,840
rotate it and it should be

530
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,120
flipping the rx and cx because sb 1 sbu

531
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,439
is like symmetrical on the connector

532
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,520
you can also power the batch similar to

533
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,679
the previous years on the

534
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,679
on the usb connector it has a

535
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,000
voltage regulator pulling the voltage

536
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,960
down to 3.3 volts and that the whole

537
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,400
patch runs on that

538
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,080
the batteries they um

539
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,000
they have a boost so they boost the

540
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,120
voltage up to 3.3

541
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,559
mostly because the same d when running

542
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,600
in the circuit python setup it has the

543
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,399
brownout levels

544
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,320
are fairly high and when the led sort of

545
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,200
starts blinking a little

546
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,000
they pull a bit of current and then if

547
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,600
we hit the

548
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,240
brown out um the the batch will just

549
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,279
restart

550
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,960
and and it won't go in so the normal run

551
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,400
mode will go into brown out mode

552
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,320
so you can fix your code and then you

553
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,000
can sort of go back in

554
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,760
but if if i just run the batteries

555
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,320
directly in you will hit that all the

556
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,879
time

557
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,439
so this voltage boost was needed and

558
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,200
also we added a

559
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,880
physical switch you can turn the batch

560
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
on and off it's only turning the

561
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
batteries on and off so we have usb

562
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,559
connected it will always

563
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,080
be powered um but the battery you can

564
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,600
disconnect with the switch and it's sort

565
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,600
of put a little bit inside

566
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,840
so you shouldn't sort of dangle and

567
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,840
accidentally turn it on

568
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,799
the batches come with a uf2 bootloader

569
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,639
that's the

570
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,879
bootloader that's normally used along

571
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
with circuit python

572
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,320
if you double click the or click twice

573
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,320
on the

574
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,158
the reset button when you have it

575
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,480
connected to usb it should show up as

576
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,880
bh batch boot uh and that's where you

577
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,799
can drop in files uh if you want to

578
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
update your circuit python so on or if

579
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,200
you want to put other things on there

580
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,120
and write c code or something like that

581
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,159
circuit python um is uh

582
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,600
preloaded on the batch yeah when um when

583
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,320
you're in this mode if you accidentally

584
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,158
go into the

585
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,000
the little status led next to the main

586
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,960
controller that will fade sort of slowly

587
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,159
in and out so if you see that that's

588
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,679
likely because you click

589
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,679
reset a little too quickly or something

590
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,240
circuit python is adafruit's version of

591
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,520
python and it's

592
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,600
sort of a modified micropython sort of

593
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,760
slightly deviated from the standard

594
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,879
micropython

595
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,520
it has a setup where when you

596
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,600
edit a file and just say save on the

597
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,240
device it will automatically reload

598
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,439
the the running program and run your

599
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,279
code again

600
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:49,279
which makes for a really quick sort of

601
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,880
development see what's going on cycle so

602
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,320
having this sort of software like

603
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,559
development setup is

604
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,799
i think is is really neat for for

605
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,678
hardware hardware projects

606
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,200
um and it should help anybody else

607
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,840
especially people who haven't

608
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,240
coded electronics before took it in and

609
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,279
and

610
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,240
modify their their batch a little bit

611
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,240
on the software side

612
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,760
it's just yeah edit code pi and save the

613
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,840
file and you'll have a

614
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,960
a new text running on the little marquee

615
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,918
thing so there are some things that

616
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,080
hasn't been done

617
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,440
yet it's planned to be done but it will

618
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,360
be done sort of over time

619
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,200
it's not super critical for this event

620
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,520
right now uh but the usb

621
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,039
vendor ids and product ids right now

622
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
they're just sort of stolen from some

623
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,640
other

624
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,000
projects um but to get them into circuit

625
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,240
python and have circuit python

626
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,760
sort of maintain hand the batch in there

627
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,880
officially they will need to be like

628
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,360
official uh

629
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,399
vendor ids and i'll get that done

630
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,840
eventually

631
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,039
um so that if when it gets up there and

632
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,918
it's part of circuit python

633
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,279
uh it will be it'll be correct um when

634
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,080
you guys want to update your batch you

635
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,600
can just

636
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,520
uh get a new circuit python down there

637
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,120
and it'll update it all could be done

638
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,679
via usb you'll need a programmer for

639
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,918
that

640
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,880
so the plan for this patch with like a

641
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,919
lot of leds

642
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,240
um that was to um

643
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,360
to have it it picked and placed so it

644
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,799
was like

645
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,559
with with these many leds you don't want

646
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,760
to do it at hand i did the prototypes by

647
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,960
hand because i didn't have a pick and

648
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,600
place machine

649
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,480
and and just placing the leds not the

650
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,879
other parts

651
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,679
just the leds takes 40 minutes if you

652
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,760
sort of

653
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,600
i think i know what i'm doing and help

654
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,158
prep but it's still 40 minutes

655
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,918
for one batch that's not fun so if you

656
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,360
start calculating out 40 minutes you

657
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,320
need the other components that may be 20

658
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,399
minutes more

659
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,520
and there's an hour per batch with 200

660
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,678
batches okay that's

661
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,918
ends up being 200 hours that's more than

662
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:50,559
months of work

663
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:54,640
that's not what time we have so

664
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,639
the plan was to do production in china

665
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,000
that didn't really happened because

666
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,760
stuff

667
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,600
didn't work um so the infrared stuff the

668
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,200
booting up where the batch sort of

669
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,439
started resetting when the

670
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,320
ld controller started up and so on that

671
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,840
sort of

672
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,600
when we were so supposed to start

673
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,480
production that was sort of the what was

674
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,039
happening

675
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,320
so backup solution ended up being that i

676
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,240
have a friend with a picking place

677
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,240
machine that's a good friend to have

678
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,440
especially if he does pick electronic

679
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,039
projects so

680
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,279
um i asked him and he he said that

681
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,039
he'll be willing to help out with uh

682
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,640
with populating all these batches and

683
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,679
soldering him and so on

684
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,279
um so

685
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,760
for the rest of this talk i'll talk a

686
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,480
little bit about sort of how

687
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,520
these ping play stuff a couple of weeks

688
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,960
ago i was sort of thinking

689
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,639
maybe i should have a ping place machine

690
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,799
but after

691
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,159
actually using one and doing a project

692
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,600
like this

693
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,799
i'm not sure i want the pink place

694
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,520
machine because they need to be

695
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,720
babysitting

696
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,960
you need to be babysitting these

697
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,880
machines and you actually

698
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,880
if you want to have something that does

699
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,559
like fast production

700
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,919
you need like a really expensive machine

701
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,960
and if you have a really expensive

702
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,480
machine

703
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,760
you would need to have a lot of stuff

704
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,240
going through that machine otherwise you

705
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,679
wouldn't

706
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,960
ever pay it back so um so yeah having

707
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,240
your own pink and place machine i don't

708
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,039
think that's uh

709
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,080
unless you really sort of need it i

710
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,080
don't think so

711
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,360
um the machine we used here had a has

712
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,960
four heads so it can pick up four

713
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,240
components at the same time

714
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,799
and then go in and place these

715
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,320
components so to optimize

716
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,320
the the speed of production how fast

717
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,760
these patches could be produced because

718
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,520
even with a pick and place machine

719
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,360
starting to calculate okay how many

720
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,120
hours should this machine be running

721
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,760
successfully these patches

722
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,239
it ends up being like 20 hours and we

723
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,760
don't

724
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,960
like just have infinite time so

725
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
we spend most of two days and a lot of

726
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,039
two nights

727
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,559
to get these up and running um

728
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,600
but but placing these sort of

729
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,799
which head places which components uh in

730
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,760
a somewhat uh

731
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:03,279
optimized way can can help reduce the

732
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,440
the time it takes to

733
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,840
place the parts um and also the feeders

734
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,799
that

735
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,918
the parts come in on um having those

736
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,399
sort of

737
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,240
placed in a neat way especially when we

738
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,080
have these

739
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,600
288 leds that need to be placed and the

740
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,399
other components are sort of low

741
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,760
low count we actually had two feeders

742
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,600
feeding these leds

743
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,039
so that they could move quicker and pick

744
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
them up and we didn't have to replace

745
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,840
wheels

746
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,000
as often as we would if we've only won

747
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,600
one reel there

748
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,039
so let's see if it works yeah so this is

749
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,039
the machine picking up

750
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,720
two parts and two reels checking with

751
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,679
the vision that the parts are actually

752
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,200
on the feeders

753
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,519
and then placing them on the badge and

754
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,440
then you see one head has this section

755
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,200
next that has next section so the

756
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,200
movement of the head is the minimal

757
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,840
amount of movement that we could sort of

758
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,840
come up with

759
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,440
but getting to that point needs a little

760
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,279
tweaking because

761
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,440
which head is number one how is the

762
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,080
badge rotated and so on in the machine

763
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,480
and all these little things that takes

764
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,559
time

765
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,840
and that's sort of the setup time of a

766
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,799
pick and place machine getting the

767
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,039
feeders

768
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,840
put on with the the reels you have you

769
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,919
purchased

770
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,879
and positioning the machine telling the

771
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,000
machine which

772
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,799
sort of feeder is which component and

773
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,159
and where the nozzle which nozzle should

774
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,399
pick up in which feeder

775
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,760
all these little things is as a planning

776
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,479
process that if you send them to china

777
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,879
they will they will handle that

778
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,080
but if you want to optimize for cost or

779
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,159
speed or something like that

780
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,240
then when you design your projects

781
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,840
having some of these things in mind

782
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,919
might actually save you a bit of money

783
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,000
or time even if you don't do the

784
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,320
production yourself

785
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
the software for this machine is it's a

786
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,918
chinese machine

787
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,440
most of this is actually in english but

788
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,240
the dialogue boxes are usually in

789
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,080
chinese

790
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,000
so you kind of have to know what it

791
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,840
means by what they want

792
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,840
because you can't read it

793
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,039
not all of the um the process is

794
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,559
automated

795
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,960
my friend doesn't have a like an

796
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,000
automated paste dispenser for instance

797
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,760
so the first process

798
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,240
in the pcb is putting the pcb in this

799
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,039
little jig that i have put together

800
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,240
mostly with tape and 3d printer parts

801
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,320
and then um

802
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,559
squeegee on the paste that's the little

803
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,960
solder that holds all the components to

804
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,960
the board

805
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,080
getting this job right is

806
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:34,080
kind of important because if you have

807
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,678
them smudged and sort of touching each

808
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,320
other

809
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,720
then you will have to fix stuff later on

810
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
and

811
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,760
some of the badges quite a lot of them

812
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,120
especially the small parts the

813
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,919
led controllers the the solar pace got

814
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,120
so close

815
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,080
and and smudged that most of the batch

816
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,600
it had to be fixed afterwards by hand

817
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,678
another issue is that some of the leds

818
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,760
like the one in the corner up here

819
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,760
that the machine put it on the sides so

820
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,440
it doesn't really shine up

821
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,879
i think we catch most of them but there

822
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,279
might be a few that

823
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,720
we've missed but this manual step of

824
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,159
looking through a microscope and

825
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,439
checking all the uh

826
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,280
all the parts that they're on there and

827
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,960
then adding the leftover parts like

828
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,399
connectors and the

829
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,399
the controllers they're all placed by

830
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,399
hand by me and my friend

831
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:26,000
so it was like a tedious job and it

832
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:29,040
it ended up taking at least two days and

833
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,040
most of the nights also

834
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,879
i put up all the files on the

835
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,560
on the github repo i see already people

836
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,759
have

837
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,480
been doing uh pull requests uh

838
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,639
issues and that's awesome i'll i'll get

839
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,320
to them and look at him and

840
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,839
you're very welcome to do pull request

841
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,520
if you have like an awesome project you

842
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,320
invite some code that can go on there

843
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,079
uh very welcome to um to do it and

844
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,079
sharing it via this repo

845
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,520
i'll i'll try to be as quick as possible

846
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,520
to to get it put in there

847
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,640
any questions

848
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
yep

849
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,799
so all the feeders are i used to to put

850
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,280
the leds on there

851
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,119
uh so it picks up you could put four

852
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
feeders in there but we also needed so

853
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,040
there was we had a limited amount of

854
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,359
eight millimeter feeders

855
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,200
so if you want to so if you took an

856
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,598
extra feeder for an led we would have to

857
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,598
manually place a resistance that

858
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:44,720
so it was also weighing out

859
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:48,480
which sort of work

860
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:51,200
and also halfway during this the

861
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,880
nozzle free stopped uh sucking up the

862
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,960
air so to pick up the components so we

863
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,520
had to sort of decommission feeder free

864
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,240
nozzle free and then only having three

865
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,400
feeders

866
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,000
that changed the sort of time to

867
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,440
populate a board from six minutes to

868
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,800
seven and a half minutes

869
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,920
so that's just so so even with the same

870
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,720
parts the same population it's a

871
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,119
25 extra time just because the feeders

872
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,118
are different

873
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:30,640
any other questions

874
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,320
otherwise uh feel free so uh to sort of

875
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,078
ask me during camp i'll be here all the

876
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,160
time um

877
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,760
and i i have a little mini electronics

878
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,480
lab sitting down in one of the workshop

879
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,800
rooms

880
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,320
so if one of you you want yourself see

881
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,480
in a little bit more we can

882
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,440
maybe do a little session and uh and

883
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,119
hang out down there

884
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,040
i have a little microscope all so we can

885
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:54,000
inspect the pcbs

886
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:57,440
see if they are properly fixed

887
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,160
cool i hope you guys have

888
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:09,839
fun with the batch and do some

889
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:09,839
interesting projects

890
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,920
