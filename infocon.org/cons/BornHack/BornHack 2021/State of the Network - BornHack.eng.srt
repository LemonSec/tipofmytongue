1
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,879
the victory

2
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,160
sure

3
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,949
[Music]

4
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,839
i was kind of asking the video guys

5
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,000
so first of all

6
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
you should check this way ahead that's

7
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,959
why you should feel 50 minutes

8
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,760
streaming

9
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,080
me

10
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,800
yes

11
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,880
so welcome to almost the last talk of

12
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,640
this year and this is the time where

13
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
morton gets to brag about how well the

14
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,010
network has run through the camp

15
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,409
[Applause]

16
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,360
so it's nice

17
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,320
sorry

18
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
it's nice to see so many people um

19
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
i have um

20
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
added something um

21
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,120
by request from the noc team

22
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,880
um so this is the usual end of camp

23
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,720
network

24
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
network um talk where we will go through

25
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,519
what we've been doing and

26
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,200
we have done all kinds of interesting

27
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,760
things and you guys have also and this

28
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,000
is the talk about that so

29
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
um

30
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
you all know hypnotoad right

31
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,519
okay

32
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,279
so first things first this is the

33
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,839
mandatory slide about how much bandwidth

34
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,360
we've been using

35
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,640
and last year i had this

36
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,560
recurring thing saying use more

37
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,439
bandwidth and

38
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
well i just skipped that hashtag because

39
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,959
apparently it's not working to say it

40
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,480
so just

41
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,519
a quick one on the slides

42
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,839
yes

43
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,480
oh this is much better anyway so what

44
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,600
you see is the red line that is 200

45
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
megabits

46
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,279
um

47
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,160
i'm

48
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,279
yeah and i'm pretty sure that um

49
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,279
the big line here is probably someone

50
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,079
doing an iperf or maxing out the network

51
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,399
or whatever testing you could do

52
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,240
but um when i look at this slide i'm

53
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,279
thinking

54
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
i'm gonna have a hard time convincing

55
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,680
orca to give a three gigabit next year

56
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
or five or ten

57
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
so we kind of need to

58
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,680
do some design changes in order to use

59
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
massive amounts of bandwidth because we

60
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,079
of course only like bandwidth it's just

61
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,079
not something we use but we like it

62
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,440
so

63
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,160
i have divided this token to two parts

64
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,240
all the core stuff and all the non-core

65
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,839
stuff so um just to give you a bit of um

66
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,079
agenda for this

67
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,200
so we of course started as we always do

68
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
in the weekend and we start

69
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
looking at all the stuff we have and

70
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,279
there have been a lot of switches and

71
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,839
stuff that we brought we being

72
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,200
my team not me

73
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,519
um and then then

74
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,200
sunday or was it saturday oh it was

75
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
saturday

76
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,279
yay now we have the fiber link you know

77
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,880
the converter from mx to lc you know if

78
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,480
you were here last year you probably

79
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,959
remember me talking about mx connectors

80
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,040
nobody uses that except broadcast people

81
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,519
so of course nobody has that in stock

82
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,880
but this year we were well

83
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
we were well prepared

84
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,680
and um

85
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,480
the thing that happened was that um

86
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,040
espeon he brought the

87
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,320
mx to lc converter and there was an mx

88
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,519
thing in the well so what's the problem

89
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,560
well

90
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,120
well of course then some bright person

91
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,079
said

92
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,160
didn't we have two cables last year

93
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,000
the thing that happened was that if you

94
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
see here

95
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
this is a connector with a flange which

96
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,560
is you know for built into equipment

97
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,320
and this here is the thing for the

98
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,760
connector cables

99
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,360
so we had two of those

100
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,440
wonderful

101
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,320
um

102
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
so um we um

103
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,560
well

104
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
i went through my phone book to find

105
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,800
broadcast people who actually had some

106
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,519
of this stuff but all of them were when

107
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,760
had gone to le mans and some place in

108
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,120
jutland so

109
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
my connections were no good but we

110
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,839
acquired one in a proper connector cable

111
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,800
in

112
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,079
during saturday but before that

113
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,320
we actually punched a hole through which

114
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,279
i think is immensely super nice

115
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,639
um so

116
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,560
this is um apparently a picture we're

117
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,120
gonna do every year because i like this

118
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,839
this is the uplink and we have light

119
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,279
awesome um

120
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,800
um as i said we were short of cable so

121
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,719
how to fix that when you work with light

122
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,639
yes

123
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,360
we um we use the scratch in order to

124
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,160
have the two um flange ends meet up so

125
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,760
that we could actually test the if we

126
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,040
had a connection

127
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,839
which

128
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,320
worked

129
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,920
well

130
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,519
actually it worked well

131
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,920
it was just that you know um

132
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,160
shouldn't be too windy or anyone

133
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,399
touching it because you know light and

134
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,240
you know different angles would not be a

135
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
good thing so but we actually had them

136
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
light through the um

137
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
the um

138
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,399
the equipment on saturday

139
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,839
this was

140
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,040
quick

141
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,880
um

142
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,759
so

143
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,639
um

144
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,000
we of course

145
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,759
ran into other issues

146
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,680
because you know

147
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,000
this is born hack and what would

148
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,199
networking be without extra issues

149
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,360
uh this one was a new one you know we we

150
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,720
plan for a lot of things we bring a lot

151
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,560
of equipment and you know spare fibers

152
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,720
and all kinds of stuff and what we

153
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,519
hadn't planned for was a beautiful red

154
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,560
digger

155
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,240
next to the well

156
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,399
so um

157
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,720
well i don't know how to say this but

158
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,440
you you see the the red digger this is

159
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,680
um

160
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,880
this one here is our pole

161
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,040
you know that for the crossing road and

162
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,199
we have this nice large digger next to

163
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,079
it

164
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,480
and it's just the the the strings we

165
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,079
attach in order to

166
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,360
make the pole not fall over was actually

167
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,600
going across the digger

168
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,279
so we kind of you know

169
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,320
um

170
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,360
this might be an issue you know

171
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
um and then so i wrote this a nice uh

172
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,759
thing and put it in the windscreen with

173
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,800
uh with some of the bone heck

174
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,320
flopper tape

175
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
flower

176
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,720
flutter bunt i'm learning touch with

177
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,440
some flutterband and

178
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,199
wrote that hey please take care of our

179
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,160
fiber

180
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,359
and the guy he uh he called and monday

181
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,720
morning i was not here we were all um

182
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,799
we you know planned for the worst hope

183
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,359
for the best situation um it could have

184
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,919
been some idiot driving this thing and

185
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:16,799
the

186
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,319
complete no-brainer start digging

187
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,439
everywhere

188
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,079
but it turned out to be a nice guy who

189
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,959
was super helpful

190
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,359
and

191
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,079
we had some

192
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,559
we had some help building this actually

193
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,000
i've inverted these two slides let's do

194
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
the next one

195
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,160
so we had this guy and we actually

196
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,679
installed

197
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,320
an extra little tube going from our well

198
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,000
to the fence so and then move the pole

199
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,559
and he was helpful doing that with us

200
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,799
and then we have our two and these are

201
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,080
not

202
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,600
publicly employed these are from the

203
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,880
network team

204
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,280
you see we have this i'm the manager i

205
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,880
don't do much and then we have our

206
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
supervisor and then we have the ticket

207
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,799
people doing the work right

208
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,360
this is moral support i've heard that is

209
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,039
super important so you don't feel alone

210
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,840
when you work hard

211
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,120
yes

212
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
and of course we have tried to anonymize

213
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,799
them so that

214
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,600
to protect the innocent and such

215
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,320
anyway i just wanted to show you uh this

216
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,960
one where i um

217
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,320
this is how it looks uh yesterday

218
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,600
i tried to pick a panoramic view of this

219
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
and you see there's a big hole here

220
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
we have our well here and then there's a

221
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,919
big hole on the other side so there's a

222
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,360
big hole two meters including our well

223
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,600
and a big hole in the other side and it

224
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,320
was also there that they you know

225
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
killed the water pipe earlier

226
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,240
but they were nice and they killed the

227
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,760
water not our

228
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,880
fiber

229
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,000
we like that so sensible people kill

230
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,160
water not our fiber because that would

231
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
have been problematic who wants the

232
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,360
fiber cut but um he was really nice that

233
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,360
guy and he got two packets of stroke

234
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,880
rifle and

235
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
so that worked

236
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,360
and

237
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,919
this is um it just makes me happy when

238
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,480
you meet people who are sensible who

239
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,919
just

240
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,080
find solutions to crap problems that

241
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,559
none of us have invented and just

242
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,520
ram into them um

243
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,600
and this is the kind of problems that

244
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,360
since we actually were well prepared we

245
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,160
had

246
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
actually configured all the switches and

247
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,360
start in advance

248
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,720
we can

249
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,039
i think that when you do good planning

250
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,400
and are well prepared

251
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,120
you have capacity to handle

252
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,480
uh yeah who foresaw this one it might be

253
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,960
in some book in at the municipality that

254
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,880
they're gonna dig now but

255
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,640
uh i'm not gonna look into that one i

256
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,720
don't even know where to find it so a

257
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,320
lot of crap will appear and they will

258
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
have a lot of problems we also had this

259
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,360
issue with

260
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,440
all our knock equipment being at the

261
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,919
furthest end of the container so power

262
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,360
cables for the

263
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,799
switches and such

264
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,559
it's uh we

265
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,720
it's not something that the dutch people

266
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,559
have that brings most of the equipment

267
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
they use you know shuku which is

268
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,039
not what we use in denmark because

269
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,600
safety

270
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,159
monopoly i don't know why we use these

271
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,320
three-legged things um

272
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,400
so but that was foreseen we actually

273
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,720
bought an extra box from my home i have

274
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,760
spare

275
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,679
because then we could get started this

276
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,000
is planning to make stuff easier and

277
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,559
then we have capacity to handle weird

278
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,640
 which always happens for some

279
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,840
reason

280
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,720
okay

281
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,520
so

282
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,919
the end result of this was that we

283
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,280
actually got this um

284
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,080
light through so when you when you when

285
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,640
you build something like this um we know

286
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,919
that

287
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,559
as soon as possible we want to know if

288
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,360
we have a light going through from

289
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,720
our end to the data center in gilster

290
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
because that means that we have layer

291
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,320
one up and running we have you know

292
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,440
um stuff has been configured ish right

293
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,640
and when you have layer one up and

294
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,480
running you wanna have layer three up

295
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,720
and running also and of course there was

296
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,960
some configuration issue so that we

297
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,120
didn't have layer 3 at once

298
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,799
that's fine that's happens every year

299
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,400
that we have some non-standard

300
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,000
configuration and

301
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,240
our provider kind of forgets something

302
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,000
so we call them and we know that this

303
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,880
happens but what happened this

304
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,280
this bonhack was that we actually had

305
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
internet up and running since monday

306
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,000
afternoon i think that is super cool and

307
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
i think the network team

308
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,600
should get an approach for that

309
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:49,089
[Applause]

310
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,010
okay um we continue as always um

311
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,520
[Music]

312
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,559
this is one of those

313
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,840
marketing

314
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,480
pictures where this is after we cleaned

315
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,559
up

316
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,480
it didn't look like that all the time

317
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,400
but now it looks nice and clean right it

318
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
also helps with other things like

319
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,159
finding the right cables and such but

320
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,720
this is our server room um we actually

321
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
have room to move now we kind of move

322
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,559
all the firefighting equipment elsewhere

323
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,919
i think that's a super nice idea we're

324
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,840
going to do that next year also

325
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,480
um and then you have all our equipment

326
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,159
we have

327
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,120
our

328
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,600
nox server which runs

329
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,799
virtual machines for dhcp and dns and

330
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,240
what's the third one

331
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,600
and

332
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,600
we have some equipment in the stack

333
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,000
which is the core switches the wireless

334
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
controller and

335
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
this year we also had an extra

336
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,919
virtual machine

337
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,400
host we had another server and then we

338
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
have all the cables coming in and out

339
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,039
and that's a nice setup

340
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,120
one of the

341
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,440
designs that we use here that is

342
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,000
different than from most places is that

343
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,480
we really don't want your data

344
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,039
we want to make an effort in preserving

345
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,400
your privacy and that includes turning

346
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,640
off a lot of logging on these devices

347
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,880
and when we leave we are going to wipe

348
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,080
the servers

349
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,919
that's just how it works so that we will

350
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,000
not have your mac addresses we will not

351
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,880
know

352
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,799
when you went from one tent to the other

353
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,360
you know normal wireless systems they

354
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,200
can track you by mac address when you

355
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,320
move from ap to ap and such

356
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,039
and um all this dns stuff and so on this

357
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,440
is simply not something we log and now

358
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
when we're done here we're going to wipe

359
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,200
the servers as we always do so

360
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,799
[Applause]

361
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,600
yes

362
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,039
so this was a little view into our r31

363
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,600
our server room it's not the toilet it's

364
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,520
the one between the toilets just saying

365
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
yes

366
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,720
okay

367
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,279
we um we use a bit of fiber on field

368
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,320
and what you see here is me and my phone

369
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,640
going for a walk

370
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,679
a long

371
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,960
walk

372
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,440
and for some reason somebody decided to

373
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,400
put him through the nettles so that i

374
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,360
you know

375
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,200
it's wonderful you know might have an

376
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,520
issue with that you're saying

377
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,080
um but the interesting part here is that

378
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,799
we

379
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,120
we have kilometers of fiber and you can

380
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,520
see this design we have where we

381
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,799
you know

382
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,200
this looks like a standard star topology

383
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
no actually it doesn't but it is

384
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
so we have

385
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
r31 here

386
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
in the middle of everything oh i forgot

387
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,760
noisy on this one noisy is over here

388
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
i have that one in stock also

389
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,760
so

390
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,080
cute

391
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,200
so we have um a fiber going from we have

392
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,880
a distribution point next to r31 and we

393
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,039
have fibers coming in and out and what

394
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,200
you can do with fiber which is which is

395
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,760
super cool is that you can make passive

396
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,640
connections so what you have from all

397
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,200
the way up to the well through campsite

398
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
through down and

399
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,159
down into r31

400
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,799
we have a passive connection for the

401
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,840
fiber which means that if power drops

402
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,400
everywhere else than in data center

403
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,000
gilster or data center r31

404
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,840
then we actually still maintain internet

405
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,840
connection and it means that when you

406
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,400
are on site like imagine you have you

407
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
are in the general camping

408
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,640
and for some reason is power outage um

409
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,559
different places you are actually not

410
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,039
affecting the other areas

411
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,360
and that is a super nice feature of this

412
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,039
um

413
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,919
of these fibers so we have fibers with

414
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,159
two cores with virus eight core four

415
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,320
twelve i don't remember numbers

416
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,640
but one like the one that crosses the

417
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,279
road from r31 to our distribution point

418
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,679
it ha it's a twelve core thingy

419
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,000
and it just means that we have um a

420
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,640
different different site or different

421
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,559
area per

422
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,960
fiber and that's that's actually quite

423
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,559
nice

424
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,480
um this is something we have been

425
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,840
discussing

426
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,120
because i'm i'm i'm always doing this um

427
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
stupid drunk guy scenario

428
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,720
and it turns out that the

429
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
stupid drunkard is not someone who

430
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,600
touches our network at the bone heck and

431
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,000
it's really nice to

432
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,320
be around people who treat our equipment

433
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,440
nice and you know play along because

434
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,440
otherwise we really should have insane

435
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,600
amounts of protection and ensure that

436
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,679
everything is super armored and locked

437
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,279
down and all kinds of stuff that we

438
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,760
don't want to spend our time doing so

439
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,000
you treat our equipment well

440
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,320
and that's that's all we can ask for so

441
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,039
thank you for that

442
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,520
um

443
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,559
these fibers yes some people have them

444
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,679
under their pillow or something we

445
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,760
borrow some left and right actually the

446
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,799
2.4 kilometers i don't think they

447
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,159
include the 300 meters from kamsa so

448
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,399
it's actually more we have

449
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,399
but we still have a bit in spare so we

450
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,000
of course have not abused only used a

451
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,960
bit more than two kilometers why not

452
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,760
um

453
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,799
and all this stuff we get it from event

454
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,960
infra

455
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,440
event info is an organization in holland

456
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,840
that just has

457
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,799
a lot of equipment and now we get back

458
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,880
to the good part about doing bone hack

459
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,399
during corona

460
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,559
there are not other hacker camps

461
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,559
which means like last year we can just

462
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,799
say two of those three of those one of

463
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,320
those oh that one looks nice and then

464
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,960
just pick and choose right

465
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,159
and that's really cool and um

466
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,520
we might need to do a bit more detailed

467
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,840
planning and borrow a bit less in the

468
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,679
coming years if there are other hacker

469
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,520
camps

470
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,399
so

471
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,320
we uh that's that's actually one of the

472
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,679
reasons why i do this um

473
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,320
fairly detailed map about where stuff is

474
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,240
with gps and you know which cable we use

475
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,520
for wear because when we get pressed on

476
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,640
the equipment we want to know

477
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,440
in fairly great detail where stuff was

478
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,679
so that we can you know do a more

479
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,679
minimal solution than this thing where

480
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,120
we can just you know

481
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,279
oh 100 meters that's fine here we have

482
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,320
200 meter cable that's not going to be

483
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,520
as easy if we cannot borrow

484
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,080
all we want

485
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,760
bonheck actually has very little fiber

486
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,000
if any do we have any fiber i don't

487
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,399
think so

488
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,600
born heckles

489
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,200
awesome so

490
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
i'm glad that we don't have a microphone

491
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,799
in the

492
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,120
in the audience with the audience

493
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,640
um

494
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,840
some people might say

495
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,080
slander but um the point is that this

496
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,520
will simply not happen without um being

497
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,000
able to borrow ridiculous amounts of

498
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,080
stuff from somewhere this is not

499
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
something that we ever want to buy this

500
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,039
is

501
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,960
to use for a week well i don't know

502
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,399
maybe you can rent it but that would

503
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,799
also be very expensive

504
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,080
so

505
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,640
sorry no sorry one of the things that we

506
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,880
have been discussing which we have

507
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,960
kind of shelved for for now

508
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,080
is talking to juniper and have them

509
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,320
deliver everything we point at

510
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,399
but we don't want to draw that card

511
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,559
before we actually

512
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,320
know that everything is going to be

513
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,200
peachy and corn is kind of settled

514
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,240
so this would be one way of handling

515
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,679
some of the equipment

516
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,600
it's much easier for us to have a lot of

517
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,320
the same equipment but

518
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,880
well we're pro so it might not be

519
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,520
necessary it's just way easier okay

520
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,679
so i just want to send a lot of love to

521
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,360
event infra and say

522
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,879
thank you should give them an applause

523
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,129
[Applause]

524
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,360
yes

525
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,679
so so when the dutch people arrive they

526
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,240
have their cars packed and this is very

527
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,080
cool to see and perhaps you should you

528
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,120
know

529
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,960
rent something bigger next year let's

530
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,679
see what happens

531
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,720
okay

532
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,480
that was what i wanted to say about our

533
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,960
core functionality the non-core stuff we

534
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,840
have

535
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,000
a lot of stuff that if it breaks it's

536
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,279
well doesn't affect everybody

537
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,279
only a lot of people

538
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,919
so what we have done is that we have set

539
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,159
up 24 access points

540
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,640
and um

541
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,039
just um take notes because this is going

542
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,080
to be on jeopardy next year

543
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,919
so how many access points were connected

544
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,640
to camp in 2021

545
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,519
i said to the camping

546
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,159
so the um the idea is that well this is

547
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,159
our internal documentation which we are

548
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,200
going to put somewhere sensible but um

549
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,159
we have uh put a lot in different places

550
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,279
and um

551
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,480
actually

552
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,240
i didn't know we had a

553
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,720
a location called hammock hill

554
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,000
i find that to be a super cool name um

555
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,720
so

556
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,919
i went on a field trip to find it i

557
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,480
didn't i just knew that there were three

558
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,080
access points in the bar i forgot to

559
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,320
read our documentation so it was very

560
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,039
difficult to find but hammock hill

561
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,879
the hill part was correct

562
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,240
and

563
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,840
apparently my guess is that this one um

564
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,519
the end of camp is the last one to be

565
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,679
taken down i don't know

566
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,919
maybe

567
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,360
no

568
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,519
so um and then another interesting

569
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,559
detail is that the information disk they

570
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,320
have their own uh

571
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,919
access point

572
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,559
it's because you know a big metal

573
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,000
container is not really good for

574
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,760
wireless traffic so

575
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,640
we we have an access point just outside

576
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,440
the information disk but still doesn't

577
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,919
penetrate and that's very cool to just

578
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,919
so they have had their

579
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,519
access point

580
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,799
um

581
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:41,039
yes

582
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,880
um the aps were of course used

583
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,120
um and as you can see

584
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,320
um

585
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,799
apparently we have a day night cycle

586
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,260
and

587
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,799
[Music]

588
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,000
i didn't check but um

589
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,519
night time is

590
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:58,880
i don't think you guys go to bed at

591
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,360
midnight

592
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,919
and we had some

593
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,000
some issues we have one over there which

594
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,559
is who knows and we have

595
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,519
a dropout in the collection but

596
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,360
otherwise this is a graph that looks as

597
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,640
we expect

598
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,880
so

599
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,440
good question two seconds

600
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
305

601
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,640
i remember last last year's average was

602
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,320
1.5 per

603
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,519
participant

604
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,919
so we are actually doing less less than

605
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,840
that this

606
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,039
year but this is um i actually like this

607
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,960
graph it just it actually says a lot

608
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
about the activity right

609
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,320
so um

610
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,760
we apparently are at the

611
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,440
40 60ish and then people start arriving

612
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,880
thursday at 12 right

613
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,360
and then we had some extra activity over

614
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,960
the weekend which actually continued

615
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,880
until monday so

616
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
that's cool

617
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
um

618
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
when i look at this graph we had a

619
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,449
discussion about um

620
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,719
[Music]

621
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,199
iot devices

622
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,719
so if we are 300 people and we give

623
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,040
every and everybody has wi-fi on their

624
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,320
batch like they do on other hacker camps

625
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,000
we kind of perhaps need to know this in

626
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,159
advance in the network team because that

627
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,040
will basically double the amount of

628
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,960
people connected it might not be an

629
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,199
issue if they are using really really no

630
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,159
power no traffic but

631
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,679
i think it's worth discussing if you

632
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,159
want twice as many devices connected

633
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,000
so we are going to

634
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,719
have a wireless discussion

635
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,079
the comment is that um last year we

636
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,320
actually had pixel flute running over

637
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,960
wi-fi which gave us extra

638
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,240
connected

639
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,680
yes

640
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,800
um

641
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,040
yes i remember two years ago when i had

642
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,440
this when i held this speech um

643
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,480
this talk i said that having a wi-fi guy

644
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,320
on terrain

645
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,880
is really really cool it solves a lot of

646
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,280
problems before the rise and

647
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,839
we have had this this year also that

648
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,240
well when we set all this up we actually

649
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,920
don't know where people is going to make

650
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
their camps we have some black spots we

651
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,680
have all these things that

652
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,839
we so we kind of need to move the access

653
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,920
points a bit during camp

654
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,160
and that requires to have on-site

655
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,839
knowledge about this

656
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:46,640
so

657
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,920
that is what we have been doing this

658
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,760
time i think it works

659
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,520
ish

660
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,599
it my impression is that it have worked

661
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,359
fairly well i know that there have been

662
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,320
some

663
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,160
issues in different places but we'll try

664
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,520
to rectify them

665
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,000
if we have a guy coming in

666
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,839
at the beginning and taking it down at

667
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,200
the end

668
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,359
we it would not we would not have the

669
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:10,240
option of um

670
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,960
of changing the topology a bit

671
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,720
so i think that's

672
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,480
a plan that is here to stay that we

673
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,040
somehow run the aps ourselves

674
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,920
okay

675
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,720
um

676
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,960
yes

677
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,359
i'm i've decided that i'm allowed to

678
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,920
spell pixel flute however i want to

679
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,440
anyway this picture is from the bar a

680
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,599
couple of days ago and

681
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,839
you of course see that this is a big

682
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,040
mess as pixel flute is supposed to be

683
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,520
we have

684
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,920
but i actually like this one where i

685
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,839
don't recall his name from

686
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:56,600
the lion

687
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,440
[Music]

688
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,599
what's his name

689
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,359
rafiki that's true

690
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,280
and he's just sitting there super sin

691
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,560
and it was

692
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
a really powerful connection that just

693
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,480
make sure he stayed there that was very

694
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,240
cool and then we of course have our nog

695
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,920
weather map

696
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,000
just because

697
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,599
and then

698
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,440
i hope this is not a spoiler but my

699
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,400
guess is that this is a token

700
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,599
that's my guess i didn't play and then

701
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,760
some weirdo decided that we should have

702
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,359
our nem id login screen also

703
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,960
when i saw it the first time i thought

704
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,480
oh it's a windows machine and some

705
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,160
windows popped up

706
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,760
but apparently

707
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,440
apparently not

708
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,599
anyway as i wrote

709
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,079
we do pixel flute because because

710
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,400
because because why not

711
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,960
and um so we had some infrastructure set

712
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,599
up in in the buy area this was

713
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,680
this was espeon's doing we actually did

714
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,960
not have much to do with it otherwise i

715
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,480
would probably have found

716
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,079
some graphs on that

717
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,920
and that there was something we

718
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,160
discussed last year also that what we

719
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,880
did

720
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,960
we set a pixel through last year also oh

721
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
they set up and then

722
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,400
you sat in the bar on wireless so all

723
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,119
your floating of this device was sent

724
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,480
over wireless

725
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,560
to the access point the access point

726
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,079
sent the data back to the wireless

727
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,320
controller which sent the data back to

728
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,040
the pixelfloat machine

729
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,400
yeah about that

730
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,800
so we decided to have this stuff in the

731
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,359
um in the bar so there was a switch and

732
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,000
you could sit there and um

733
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
we uh we kind of killed it from wi-fi

734
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,640
and then rate limited on cable

735
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,240
so that was our solution so you could

736
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,560
play along if you were not in the bar

737
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,760
but

738
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,320
it was about it was a bar game it was

739
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,880
okay and then um

740
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,680
the other day um someone from from from

741
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,960
pyjamas

742
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,040
pyjama yes whatever like to be called

743
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,720
he came and said

744
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,319
how many public ips can we get

745
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,720
when i get a request like that i'm

746
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,200
always thinking

747
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
what are they up to

748
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,960
because of course i want to say yes

749
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,880
but it is it when they want a lot of

750
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,400
beatrices it usually means that we

751
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,599
should have a chat about what they're

752
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,440
doing so we can see how it fits with our

753
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,880
infrastructure

754
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,280
so um the solution was um

755
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,839
sure do dhcp and when you run out of the

756
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,640
dscp pool subtract 20 so other people

757
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,598
can connect also

758
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,040
um but um it was um

759
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,040
in my opinion a pretty weird thing that

760
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,960
is super cool

761
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,280
so perhaps if you were here an hour ago

762
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,480
you would have heard that talk about

763
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,680
this but they have of course

764
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,000
set up a raspberry pi cluster where when

765
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,560
you connect to this you get your own uh

766
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,400
docker instance with root access where

767
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,560
you can do whatever you want of course

768
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,720
you do

769
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,000
yeah yeah that's the link right so ssh

770
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,079
root whatever and then you get your own

771
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,319
um

772
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:23,599
you get your own daca instance and as i

773
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,200
also said um

774
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,680
yeah yeah

775
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,160
this can be abused to make problems for

776
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,000
us but hey if that happens we're

777
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,319
probably gonna do something and fix it

778
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,040
and that was fun anyway this is um this

779
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,720
is interesting this is basically give

780
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,040
everybody root access to a hacking

781
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,760
capable machine on our network yeah why

782
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,839
not this is born hack so of course we do

783
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,200
that

784
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,560
and the network team just says yes

785
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,720
they are not they're not all there but

786
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,279
hey come on

787
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,720
okay and then i got another one from the

788
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,480
pajamas

789
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,359
by jamie yes whatever

790
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,760
oh vlan for our esps

791
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,000
we want it for our pixel flute

792
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,440
it's just

793
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,359
what

794
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,720
hm

795
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,240
okay

796
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,440
sure

797
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,599
we can set this up

798
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:22,720
um

799
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,800
i i i wasn't even going into the

800
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,680
discussion about comparing some wireless

801
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,839
vlan thing with

802
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,560
the 10 gig cable connections in the bar

803
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,799
but

804
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,680
so

805
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,839
how did it go for them

806
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,520
so

807
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,760
so the question is which of the images

808
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,760
you saw on the other pixel flute thing

809
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,440
was them

810
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,319
well

811
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,800
well

812
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,079
this was the pixel flute thing

813
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,880
that made so much more sense

814
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,160
i actually think it's really nice it's

815
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,400
just a bunch of diodes and then

816
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,079
hammer it just like you do with the

817
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,079
other pixel flute and then

818
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,160
get a nice blanket out of it it was nice

819
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,560
idea but you know first things

820
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,380
we want to vlan for for pixel flute

821
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,119
[Music]

822
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,200
good luck good luck

823
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,880
i've seen the machinery people have

824
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,480
brought i don't think you're going to

825
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,720
rule that machine i don't think so but

826
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,680
anyway

827
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,480
that looks nice

828
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,599
and then we had a workshop on tito's

829
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,240
yay

830
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,160
yes

831
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,680
hamsa had a

832
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,839
super successful workshop on dtas

833
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,599
it was so successful it took down

834
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,020
network on the entire camp yay

835
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,280
[Applause]

836
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,640
so um as ddos goes i think that was one

837
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,000
of the more successful workshops

838
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,720
but

839
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,240
the thing that actually happened was

840
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,440
that the

841
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,359
clemson moved from noisy to camping

842
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,599
who would have sought that maybe even

843
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,560
perhaps

844
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,520
people in the nog team like cramps might

845
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,319
have known a bit about topology but hey

846
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,800
but the the um the thing we have done is

847
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,880
that we have a

848
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,760
south

849
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,640
south

850
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,079
vlan

851
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,040
for the camp and the north and uh noisy

852
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,040
in the south and the building is in

853
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,560
south and camping in the north so if you

854
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,040
do weird stuff like having your own 10

855
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
gig connection in your tent and do a

856
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,599
workshop on ddos it's smart to be you

857
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,359
know in the same

858
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,640
group

859
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,160
in the same segment

860
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,880
and um so moving to north means that

861
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,200
everything had to go through our router

862
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:11,119
so um it kind of just you know gave up

863
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,160
it was just

864
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,839
maxed out and that's that's fine it's

865
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:14,880
just

866
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,599
we kind of changed the design just a tad

867
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,200
for the second workshop so nobody

868
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,960
noticed

869
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
tell the people that it tools used were

870
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,240
hp3 and t50 so they might do it next

871
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,800
year okay i'm not to say they would use

872
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,440
h ping 3 and

873
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,040
t50 that's a secret

874
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,400
anyway

875
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,839
i i i think it's funny to make a ddos

876
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,440
workshop and take down the entire

877
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,079
network i think that's so cool

878
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:46,720
no anyway

879
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,599
that's what i've decided to include in

880
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:50,640
my

881
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,480
presentation for today

882
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,319
um i noticed that last year um i kind of

883
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,640
forgot this slide so i just we cut the

884
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,720
feed and then we started it again

885
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,640
because there might have been questions

886
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,359
so let's remember this today

887
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,880
i'm other any questions

888
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,079
mike

889
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,579
[Music]

890
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,760
how many ip addresses do we have on camp

891
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,359
that's a really good question

892
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,480
uh public

893
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,200
well we have um is a slash 23 or

894
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,160
something 5p version uh ipv4 and then we

895
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,920
have our own segment for ip version six

896
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,079
a permanent one i actually don't recall

897
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,400
these numbers

898
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,240
slice 21 okay fine so that would be

899
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,319
public ip version

900
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,880
six these would be um yeah some of you

901
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,520
may have noticed that when you go to uh

902
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,359
different sites

903
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,560
they think you are in some other country

904
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,680
um i remember one year in uh bonhag they

905
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,280
thought we were in poland

906
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,160
but it's about which geolocation

907
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,920
database you use and how fast they

908
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,480
updated and such because the ipv4

909
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,720
addresses we have are ones that we

910
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,280
borrow from ripe for this event it's

911
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,119
event ip addresses

912
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,560
and the ipv version 6 is ours and they

913
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,720
will not change so we of course are

914
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,520
going to transition to ipv version 6.

915
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,240
says kamsa

916
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,640
rp version 6 only next year good luck

917
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,599
with that

918
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,560
why did the wi-fi crash

919
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,760
i have this comment

920
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,920
this is the official not coming to this

921
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,680
aliens

922
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,720
it was a solar flare which um you know

923
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,960
and the ufo did and a little small

924
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,599
goblin and you know um massive over i

925
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,800
don't know

926
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,160
it's a secret

927
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,279
it wasn't a uh

928
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,200
it was the manual error in any way

929
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,920
i can either confirm no deny that it was

930
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,480
a manual error

931
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,280
how much data did we download and upload

932
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,200
this year and how does that compare to

933
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,439
last year

934
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,440
um i will um

935
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,640
ask my um one of my minions about this i

936
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,480
can see that he's always working hard on

937
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,640
that number

938
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,280
7.41 terabytes downloaded so we

939
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,440
downloaded

940
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,319
7.41 terabytes and we uploaded 2.74

941
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,319
terabytes

942
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,319
it's comparable to last year i remember

943
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,359
it as five last year

944
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,359
yes

945
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:21,839
we could for example use

946
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,839
we could for example use five times as

947
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,440
much bandwidth

948
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,880
for example

949
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,119
and even better

950
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,880
not to be mentioned to people but there

951
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,440
might have been a slight uh difference

952
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,440
in the bandwidth available on ip version

953
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,640
four and six

954
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,400
as in factor three or five or something

955
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,640
so

956
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,720
uh there also was uh used more bandwidth

957
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,520
than

958
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,000
visible there because uh

959
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,359
that

960
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,480
those graphs are five minute averages

961
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,040
yes we might have uh peaks that are much

962
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,599
larger we had a lot of peaks around uh

963
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,920
one gig

964
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
on 22 narrators

965
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,880
yes

966
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,720
but um yeah

967
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,880
this is farming averages which of course

968
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,000
means that

969
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,400
there might be instances probably a lot

970
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,319
of instances where someone maxes it out

971
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,240
for five seconds and such we would not

972
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,400
be able to see that here

973
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,640
yes

974
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,760
any more questions

975
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,720
then i think the network team deserves a

976
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,190
big round of applause

977
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:42,200
[Applause]
