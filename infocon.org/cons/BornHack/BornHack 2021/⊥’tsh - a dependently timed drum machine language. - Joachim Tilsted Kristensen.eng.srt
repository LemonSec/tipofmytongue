1
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
well then i would like to welcome uh

2
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
jorgen who is going to give us a talk

3
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,720
about a dependently timed drum machine

4
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
language i've been looking forward to

5
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,959
this one very much please give your game

6
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:03,780
a hand

7
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:12,959
[Applause]

8
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
hi everybody

9
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,000
i'm jorge and

10
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,720
i'm a musician but i'm also a computer

11
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
scientist

12
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,759
and

13
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,720
sometimes i like to combine the two

14
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,080
and a programming language is a

15
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,639
fun way to combine things

16
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,759
and

17
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,280
so that's what we're going to talk about

18
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,679
today

19
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,400
when you listen to a audio signal

20
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,919
for instance right now you are listening

21
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,600
to our audio signal it comes out of the

22
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,040
speaker

23
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,000
and

24
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,840
it's continuous in some sense

25
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,800
but that's of course not the way you

26
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,700
perceive it

27
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,479
[Music]

28
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,800
likely you are

29
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,880
identifying some things

30
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,199
maybe you give them a name

31
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,360
this guy here in the image

32
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,759
has some audio coming into his ear and

33
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,400
perhaps he perceives this first blue

34
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,600
square as a hand clap

35
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,560
right or a snare drum

36
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,520
and

37
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
likewise

38
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,720
when i'm producing a signal

39
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,919
i am

40
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,400
unlikely to think of the

41
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,800
continuity of things

42
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
rather i'm saying some words

43
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,600
and they have syllables

44
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
and i can put them somewhere

45
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
relative to each other in time

46
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,000
there are various ways of describing

47
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,560
how to put events relative to each other

48
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,000
in time here is a classic one sheet

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
music

50
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
all right

51
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
the first

52
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,880
so let's say that i want to say

53
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
programming drum patterns

54
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
it's unlikely

55
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,360
that i will say this during the talk

56
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
uh

57
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,479
then

58
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,080
i might use these eighth notes here

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,240
they have the same

60
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,880
duration relative to each other

61
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
so

62
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
the sentence will be

63
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,039
programming drum patterns

64
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,810
right but that's not so close to

65
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,880
[Music]

66
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,520
what the way i was thinking it

67
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
so maybe i'll make the two ladder

68
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,630
syllables a little bit faster

69
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,160
[Music]

70
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,720
the note here with two bars is a 16th

71
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
note and it's twice as fast

72
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
programming drum patterns

73
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,280
it doesn't sound that natural

74
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,800
but it has some effect

75
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,120
to fix

76
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
the amount of time i spend saying my

77
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,000
sentence i vary the tempo

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,599
by

79
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,479
putting a little indication here of how

80
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,680
much time

81
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,520
is consumed how many quarter notes is

82
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
consumed per minute that's the beats per

83
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
minute

84
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,280
the latter one here

85
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,400
is four against three against 3

86
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,000
programming drum patterns

87
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,319
neither is

88
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,720
close to what i was trying to do when i

89
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,960
said programming drum patterns

90
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,759
and

91
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,520
it's actually it's really difficult to

92
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,880
get it right with g music

93
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
nonetheless

94
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,080
dramas do put their rhythms in sheet

95
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
music

96
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,560
and here is an example

97
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
i have written a program

98
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,400
in a programming language called bottom

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,360
that i

100
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
that i uh

101
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
that i made

102
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,840
uh

103
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,520
some time ago

104
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
and so here is the program

105
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,560
the program for the

106
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
rhythm on the top here

107
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
is this program so let's hear it

108
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,680
first we'll need to compile it

109
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,199
and

110
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,440
in this prototype compiler type checking

111
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,960
is a little bit slow but that's all

112
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,198
right

113
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,680
in the meantime we can inspect the type

114
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,680
signature of the variable beat

115
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,960
as you can see here

116
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,159
the type of beat is bottom

117
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,120
16 16 because his duration is

118
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,320
16 16th notes

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
can you

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,560
unmute the

121
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
i'll just now that we have compiled it

122
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,839
it'll run a little bit faster

123
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,600
but i will

124
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,320
i'll just run it again this time

125
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,080
with the audio channel unmuted

126
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:25,149
[Music]

127
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,600
all right

128
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,640
uh

129
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
something is

130
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,839
a little bit overdriven

131
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,279
ah all right

132
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,880
you got it

133
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
and

134
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,000
so

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,160
i mean

136
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,680
it's a hip-hop beat

137
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,800
but it's not that hip

138
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
it's like a 80s hip

139
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,399
all right

140
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,000
so but

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,079
it's not uncommon to notate it like this

142
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,760
nonetheless

143
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
uh but a hip-hop musician might

144
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,680
transform what he's reading a little bit

145
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,480
and

146
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,720
a classic transformation is this

147
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,240
quintuplet shuffle

148
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,399
when i say classic i mean

149
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,560
it was hip in the hip-hop scene some

150
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,839
years ago like two years

151
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,959
and after applying the transformation

152
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,120
two eighth notes like this

153
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,320
become

154
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,160
uh

155
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,079
well

156
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,800
think of it like this

157
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,720
you have two events that happen in time

158
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,040
and

159
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
they are kind of a family the family of

160
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,839
two rhythms is

161
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,519
the

162
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,320
the family of things that happen

163
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,480
with two durations relative to each

164
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,519
other

165
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,800
after this transformation the first node

166
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,680
is

167
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,360
three-fifths

168
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,440
and the ladder is only two-fifths

169
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
and

170
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
for the sake of readability i have

171
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
overbought the quintuplet like this i

172
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,519
hope you can read it

173
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,040
let's do it in bottoms

174
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,279
so

175
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,880
what we're doing is we're adding a

176
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,320
phrasing here

177
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
and the first note

178
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,959
is three

179
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,239
it's a three against two

180
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,800
and i denote it by putting a list here

181
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,319
with a three and a two

182
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,279
we'll just compile the song again

183
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,920
while we're compiling we can expect

184
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,320
inspect the type signature

185
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
of the variable beat

186
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,399
let's just type check in emacs again

187
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,519
all right

188
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:16,409
[Music]

189
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:27,680
[Music]

190
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
all right

191
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,760
this is actually already much here so

192
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,800
i'll change the comment

193
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,000
here it's uh

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
and

195
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
expressed that i'm happier with it with

196
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,839
a smiley here

197
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,040
all right

198
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,519
the type signature of beat has become

199
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,880
8080 because now it's 80 80th notes

200
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,120
and we'll come back to

201
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,560
why it changed the type like that

202
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,000
all right

203
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,800
for some time we've been developing a

204
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,120
couple of tools for inputting rhythms

205
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,200
into computers like this

206
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
and

207
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,440
i want to put them into three categories

208
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,320
and the first category i will call a

209
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
grid editor

210
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,399
on the slide here is a illustration of

211
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
the beat plus baseline grid editor from

212
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,120
linux multimedia

213
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,279
studio

214
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,760
there's a similar

215
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
maybe it's not called the beat plus

216
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,639
baseline editor but it's

217
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,680
the same thing in cubase and pro tools

218
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
and ableton live also has a drum machine

219
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,760
like this

220
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,720
and

221
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,360
the way the program is structured is

222
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
that it has three sequences

223
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,880
one for each signal

224
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,120
the lowermost signal here is a bass drum

225
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
then there's a snare drum signal and a

226
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,839
hi-hat signal

227
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,519
and to input this rhythm here

228
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,160
which is a eighth note rhythm

229
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,000
we just plot in

230
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,519
the events where we want them to happen

231
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,959
all right

232
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,279
but if we want to do the quintuplet

233
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,240
cheerful transformation

234
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
we can't

235
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,839
really with this grid

236
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,600
because

237
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,040
i need something

238
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,720
three-fifths of the way through these

239
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,639
two notes here

240
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
right

241
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,199
and

242
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,199
to do so

243
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,199
i'll need to have a finer grid

244
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,880
and because

245
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,800
the least common multiple

246
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,199
of 5 and 8

247
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,880
is 40

248
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
i'll need a 40 grit

249
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,839
all right

250
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,079
so and

251
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,760
so and we'll talk we'll come back to

252
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,560
that

253
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,519
so that i need to refine the grid

254
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,480
speculatively before i insert my rhythm

255
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,360
into the sequencer

256
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,760
another alternative is what i would like

257
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,880
to call a signal processing language

258
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
languages like

259
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
sonic pi

260
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,800
go into this category

261
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,720
here i have denoted the transformed

262
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,959
rhythm in a programming language called

263
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,239
chuck which was pablo some years ago

264
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,120
each line

265
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
changes the velocity of the hi-hat

266
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,800
channel

267
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,880
and calls some

268
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,240
procedures that chug in a

269
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,600
wav file into the signal

270
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,839
i have

271
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,800
omitted these procedures in the interest

272
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,839
of saving space in the

273
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,120
slide all right

274
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
and then here i have put a comment about

275
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
where we are in the room

276
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
it's a little bit it becomes a little

277
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,360
bit messy and transformations on

278
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,759
programs like this one let's say that i

279
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,199
had

280
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,519
my not so hip hip algorithm and i wanted

281
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,079
to make a transformed quintuplet shuffle

282
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,240
rhythm the transformation is really

283
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,279
tedious

284
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,279
so it's not really feasible for a

285
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,600
working musician to input his drum

286
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
rhythms like this

287
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
nonetheless it is possible

288
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
then there's a third category

289
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,920
i want to call the third category

290
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,880
music score representations

291
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,560
and here are two examples of such

292
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,240
representations

293
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,920
the first one here

294
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,759
is a

295
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,079
very

296
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,340
used

297
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,839
[Music]

298
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,160
haskell haskell embedded dsl

299
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,399
for notating music

300
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,160
and it has

301
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,839
two operators

302
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,360
this one here

303
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,720
which is the at the same time operator

304
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,520
and this one which is the in sequence

305
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,119
operator

306
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,720
and i have

307
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
typed in here

308
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,919
the

309
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,439
hi-hat

310
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,079
part for the transformed rhythm

311
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,640
and i play it at the same time as my

312
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,799
transformed

313
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,839
snare drum pattern and my transform bass

314
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,319
drum pattern

315
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,600
in c sound there's an embedded dsl

316
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,039
called dseg

317
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,720
where you have an instrument that takes

318
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,280
some patch cables this magic dsec patch

319
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,360
cable and some cables that has to be

320
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,039
zero and one all the time for some

321
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,000
purpose

322
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,120
and then

323
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
a patch cable that goes to the thing

324
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,760
that outputs the wave signal and then

325
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,039
some

326
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,240
canonical

327
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,640
cables here is

328
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,840
attack

329
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,360
sustain decay release

330
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,320
and then it takes a string which is

331
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
the which represents the events that it

332
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,400
has to produce

333
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,840
and the first

334
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,600
part is

335
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,320
the one that defines the subdivision and

336
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,520
here i have typed in the transformed

337
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,960
eighth notes in a 20 grid

338
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,039
by writing r20 out here

339
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,480
to summarize

340
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
we have three categories of ways to

341
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,480
input rhythms into computers like this

342
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
the grid editor has some pros

343
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,320
the main pro i think

344
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
is that it gives a good syntactic

345
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,480
overview with this

346
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,960
grid editor you have an overview or the

347
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,160
whole bar and you cannot input something

348
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,200
that's slightly longer than the bar or

349
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,000
combine things that will do something

350
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,160
unexpected

351
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
on the other hand you'll have to

352
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,420
speculatively select a grid like this

353
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,160
[Music]

354
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,320
if you select the wrong grid

355
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,720
you either have to turn off the grid

356
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,880
and draw in your events by hand which is

357
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,200
very tedious or you have to change the

358
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,160
grid and start over

359
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,880
and furthermore the ways that you

360
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,400
specialize the grid

361
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,080
in linux multimedia system and in cubase

362
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,400
and in ableton live which is the one i

363
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,919
tried

364
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,160
is specialized for contemporary western

365
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
music

366
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
meaning that it's much easier to

367
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,600
separate separate a piece of time into

368
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
two chunks of time that have equal

369
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,320
duration than it is to separate the grid

370
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,559
into chunks of time that have different

371
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,080
durations in relation to each other

372
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,960
and finally oh now we have signal

373
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,400
processing signal processors

374
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
in a signal processor you have full

375
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,880
control of signals

376
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,080
but

377
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,480
the way we perceive signals

378
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
is in this chunks

379
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,400
that we want to give names

380
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,120
and signal processing languages have

381
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,760
poor structuring mechanisms because it

382
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,760
had all of the signal processing happens

383
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,640
at a different level of abstraction

384
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,400
finally we have the music

385
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,840
representation sheet representations

386
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
and

387
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,760
they have some pros too

388
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,799
my favorite car pro is that

389
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,919
it has a concise familiar notation

390
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,640
for a musician

391
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,840
this

392
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,919
qn variable here which represents a

393
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,640
quarter note is very easy to understand

394
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,600
and

395
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,679
talking about loudness

396
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,039
these variables here folder and metaphor

397
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,280
are

398
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
recognizable

399
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,440
from a music sheet but the structure of

400
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,159
the music sheet is gone and if one of

401
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,520
these

402
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,480
parts

403
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,600
is

404
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,600
longer than the other then the duration

405
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
of the whole thing is a direction of the

406
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,520
longest thing and if you combine them

407
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,000
you either you get some audio clipped

408
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,600
out or you get a rest somewhere and it's

409
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,360
really difficult to hear what the error

410
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,520
is

411
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,760
it also trades off the syntactic

412
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,159
constraints that we had in the in the

413
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,080
sequencer or in the grid editor

414
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,480
for this expressive power of expressing

415
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,280
rhythms any way we want

416
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,520
it also inherits an unfortunate flaw

417
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,320
from

418
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,400
sheet music

419
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
that you cannot actually talk about a

420
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,280
node by itself

421
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,240
so

422
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,039
it's if you if if you input a

423
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,080
and a node into a music sheet you cannot

424
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,640
say a c you have to say c for one

425
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,240
quarter note so the duration is embedded

426
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,240
into the thing that you're saying

427
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,039
and it has to be like that all the time

428
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,039
so it's kind of it's optimized for

429
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,960
reading

430
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,559
and it's very

431
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
that's fine if you want to give this

432
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,799
music sheet to a person who has to read

433
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,520
it

434
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,400
but it gives you some limitations

435
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,480
for expressibility

436
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
all right so i want to design a

437
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,640
programming language that solves at

438
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,039
least some of these issues

439
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,039
and i wanted to be a declarative

440
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,880
programming language

441
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
and i want to obtain this kind the same

442
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,360
kind of expressiveness

443
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
that you get from a music score

444
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,840
representation

445
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,400
but i also want it to be composable and

446
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,080
i want to separate things out so i

447
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,840
actually want to talk about the second

448
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,360
the signal separate from the rhythm

449
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,720
and finally

450
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,440
i still want to preserve these alignment

451
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
constraints that you get

452
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,200
syntactically from your grid editor

453
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
the last part here

454
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,679
about preserving alignment constraints

455
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,720
is where dependent types come in

456
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,960
as you might notice from the title of

457
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,840
the talk it's a dependently timed

458
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,520
programming language

459
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
and

460
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,760
i'll just quickly brush that up

461
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,360
what i mean by a dependent type

462
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,480
if this is a little bit hard to follow

463
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,600
don't worry but if you plan to intend

464
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,039
attend the workshop tomorrow and it felt

465
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,000
a little bit fast

466
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,919
it's best if you show up at nine

467
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,159
in the lambda calculus

468
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,559
um

469
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,840
all right

470
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,240
in the lambda calculus here is a syntax

471
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,400
for the lambda calculus all right we can

472
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
have a variable or we can have

473
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
abstraction which is annotated by a type

474
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,799
or a term or we can apply a term to a

475
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,679
term

476
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,840
right and it has some typing rules so

477
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,919
here is the syntax for terms and the

478
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,960
syntax for types it has these typing

479
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,159
judgments

480
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,960
and the abstraction typing judgment is a

481
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,000
abstraction from terms or terms

482
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,960
and

483
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,640
the application

484
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,760
rule

485
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,559
is

486
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,279
applying a term to a term

487
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,600
so clearly nothing can depend or

488
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
abstract or type

489
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,520
in this system

490
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,080
one way we could decide

491
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,760
to extend it

492
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,000
was that we could extend the syntax for

493
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,799
types with this type variable

494
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,919
and then

495
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,640
introduce a new abstraction namely that

496
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,799
a term can abstract or type

497
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,640
and a term can be applied to a type

498
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
here's an intuition

499
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,960
let's say that you have a program that

500
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,679
takes as arguments two lists

501
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,840
and appends them together

502
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,000
but it only works so long as the

503
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,200
arguments the elements of this list of

504
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
the same type

505
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,520
so it's this is basically polymorphism

506
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,360
all right

507
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,760
something else we can do is that we can

508
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,559
let

509
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,720
types abstract or types

510
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,279
and just copy the typing rules for terms

511
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,480
for types and then introduce this

512
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,440
simpler thing that types types

513
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,640
kinds

514
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,679
and

515
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,919
so now you have terms of different types

516
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,840
and types of different kinds

517
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,480
and they still abstract over each other

518
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,720
[Music]

519
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,559
finally

520
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,600
you can let a type abstract over a term

521
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,640
and

522
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
oh let's just have an intuition about

523
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,240
this one actually

524
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,120
um

525
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
applying a type to a type let's say that

526
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,919
they have a type maybe a

527
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,600
and then you apply it to an integer it

528
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,000
becomes maybe in

529
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,360
right

530
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,279
so maybe

531
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,080
has kind arrow

532
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,600
and maybe int has kind star

533
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,640
all right

[Music]

535
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,520
the intuition about this one

536
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,159
it's a you have an abstraction

537
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,640
from a type or a term which means that

538
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,400
you can now apply

539
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,159
a type to a term

540
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,039
and

541
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,559
for intuition

542
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,678
you can apply

543
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,039
a list to an integer and say that

544
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,080
the type is the type of all integers of

545
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,400
length n for some variable n in your

546
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,799
program

547
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,679
and this is exactly how we are going to

548
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,200
constraint our rhythms

549
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,440
later

550
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,559

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,720
the primitives of the language are

signals

554
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,840
and

555
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,440
for now signals are names of wave files

556
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,200

the program

559
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,120
so the program that we just listened to

560
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,760
it had a folder here called samples

and

562
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,439
the symbols they sound like this

577
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,200
rhythms which relate patterns to a grid

and grooves which associates rhythms

with signals

580
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,120
i'll make an informal introduction

581
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,520
here is a program

582
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,960
the program

583
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
has a voice

584
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,640
voice is a groove

585
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,200
and it associates the signal hi-hat to

586
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,279
this pattern here the pattern has a

587
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,279
subdivision of

588
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,320
the four first it divides time into four

589
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,720
then it divides each part into two so

590
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,520
it's eighth notes

591
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,679
there's also a snare voice

592
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,760
and a kick drum voice

593
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,520
and

594
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,559
for the ease of illustration i have made

595
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,159
a

596
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,279
graphic

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,679
the bottom t-shirt program

601
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,679
was the transformation

602
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,039
of changing the relation in duration in

603
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,520
between these eighth notes

604
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,640
we said that there were we repeated four

605
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,919
pairs

606
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,159
of eighth notes

607
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,360
and

608
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,960
for each pair

609
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
we related them in duration to each

610
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,000
other

611
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,880
three against two

612
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,279
and what bottom teesh did

613
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,360
to infer the new type

614
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,640
was to refine the grid

615
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,760
so instead of speculatively introducing

616
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
a grid and then typing in your rhythm

617
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,600
you typed in your rhythm and the type

618
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,520
system deduced

619
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,600
which was the causes

620
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,799
grid that could hold the rhythm

621
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,120
one final operation that you can decide

622
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,240
to do

623
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,640
is the one that i have denoted here

624
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,360
which moves a rhythm

625
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,279
with respect to where it's notated

626
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,600
in this case we move the snare drum hits

627
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,240
a 16th note ahead

628
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
and

629
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,080
for the sake of being instructive

630
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
we'll do this

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,080
to a program

here is a program

as you can see from the comment here

634
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,080
it's a white man's hip-hop program

and

636
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,000
let's just play it

637
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,479
also let's inspect the type of beat

638
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,200
beat has the type bottom 2

639
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,120
32 16 because this duration is 32 16th

640
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,439
notes

i'm a white guy i like hip-hop

643
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,760
but this hip-hop

644
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,720
is a bit adc now

645
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
and

646
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,440
of course

647
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,039
when you write a hip-hop beat you want

648
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,559
to make something

649
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,159
deeper

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:43,840
so

653
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,240
to make something heber

here it is

657
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,440
it's a sambar the rotor rhythm

the musicologist fabian guyon looked at

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,760
some of these sambada brother rhythms

663
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,360
and then he noted

664
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,559
that

665
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,559
the swing of this tradition of music

666
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,399
is in general

667
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,760
to put the latter two sixteenths notes

668
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,120
of pairs of four sixteenth notes

669
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,440
a little bit ahead

670
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,720
all right so when you notate it

671
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,240
you kind of

672
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,279
you want to write straight 16th notes

673

[Music]

675
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,880
right but it doesn't swing so well

676
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
actually the latter two delayed a little

677
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,120
bit

678
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,600
and

679
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,519
i want to put this into my hip-hop beat

680
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,879
let's try it out

681
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,440
all right

682
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,120
to put the hip-hop beat a little bit

683
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,039
behind

684
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,399
we use the

685
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,600
arrow

686
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,880
to the a little bit behind we use the

687
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,159
arrow

688
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,279
to the left operator

689
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,320
it looks like this

690
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,880
and then we put it a little bit behind

691
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,600
let's say we put it one sixteenth

692
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,080
note behind

693
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
one 64th

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,360
all right

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,320
let's inspect the rhythm of the type of

699
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,639
beat

700
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,039
let's type shaking emacs again

701
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,440
it has become 128 64th note because we

702
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,080
need a finer grid to associate

703
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,159
this last letter 16th note with

704
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,900
somewhere a little bit ahead

705
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:31,670
[Music]

706
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,960
i still think it sounds a little bit

707
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,200
white

708
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,279
because

709
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,679
because the snare drum and the kick drum

710
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,720
are still

711
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,159
right on time

712
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,080
let's leave a little bit of space around

713
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,080
the poles by putting the snare drum a

714
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,760
little bit behind the pulse and the kick

715
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,880
drum a little bit ahead of the pose

716
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,279
we put the snare drum a little bit

717
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,519
behind the pose by using the arrow to

718
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,320
the right operator

719
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,239
this one you will have already seen

720
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,239
before

721
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,159
it's type checking let's inspect the

722
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,800
type of beat

723
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,079
oh

724
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,839
it's a much finer grid

725
00:34:53,010 --> 00:35:05,309
[Music]

726
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,760
all right

727
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
actually

728
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,160
now it sounds much heavier the much the

729
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,480
finer grit makes it much heavier now

730
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,400
it's a brazilian man's hip-hop

731
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,079
and i'll change the comment out here as

732
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,960
well

733
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,000
because i like it

734
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,839
all right

735
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,520
there's a little bit of formalism to

736
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,640
bottom two as well

737
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,359
we'll go over that

738
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,839
now

739
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,040
so just to repeat

740
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,760
the syntax

741
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,800
is

742
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
signals are

743
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,119
well-formed variable names of sig of

744
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,560
signals

745
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,440
then

746
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,480
you can have an accent

747
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,119
which is represents loudness

748
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,160
and

749
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,079
because we are programmers we'll just

750
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,760
represent it with a byte so it's a

751
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,960
number from zero to f and

752
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,200
then in the rest of the syntax i'm going

753
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,520
to use these letters for natural numbers

754
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,680
and cues for rationals

755
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,160
a groove is either a signature that

756
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
demands a duration

757
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,680
on our groove and it gives a type error

758
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,960
if the groove is either too long or too

759
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,839
short

760
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,160
so you can state that your groove is in

761
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,359
four four

762
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,839
i actually think we

763
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,640
did already

764
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,240
oh yeah here it was

765
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,359
all right

766
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,200
so if i change the signature here

767
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,480
i get a type error

768
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,200
first it tried to refine the grid

769
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,079
and it got to refine it to 320 but then

770
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,800
it realized that to be

771
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,480
three quarter notes

772
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,280
the rhythm should be

773
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,079
320 uh 320 note

774
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,359
and

775
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,079
240 is not 320

776
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,200
the compiler says

777
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
uh

778
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,240
i'll agree that we can extend bottom

779
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,839
ties to have

780
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,880
better type errors

781
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,720
sometime in the future

782
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,040
all right

783
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,440
a groove can also be a voice

784
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,280
which associates

785
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,760
a rhythm with a signal

786
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,960
as we did with the hi-hat

787
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,160
it can be a repetition of a groove

788
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,880
it can be a groove

789
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,119
played at the same time as another

790
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,960
groove

791
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,960
and it can be a groove

792
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,720
played before

793
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,040
another groove

794
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,880
and a rhythm

795
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
can be a subdivision

796
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,280
followed by a pattern

797
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,160
or it can be a phrasing of a subdivision

798
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,599
followed by a pattern

799
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,119
we did this with the shuffle

800
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,040
transformation

801
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,480
it can also be

802
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,960
a rhythm which is a little bit ahead

803
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,640
as we did with the brazilian man's

804
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,000
hip-hop

805
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,599
it can be a rhythm which is a little bit

806
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,119
behind

807
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,320
and

808
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
it can be a rhythm followed by another

809
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,000
rhythm

810
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,119
finally

811
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,440
a pattern can be actually asian

812
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,320
and an x which is the continuation of a

813
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,560
previous

814
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,079
a previous event

815
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,119
the reason for the and next is that when

816
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,200
we refine the grid

817
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,560
we want to enforce the duration of

818
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,040
the previous rhythm

819
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,680
and it can also be a

820
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,839
rest or an abyss or it can be the empty

821
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,040
pattern and

822
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,200
the typing judgment

823
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
that we use to infer

824
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,079
the course's grid

825
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,560
come following

826
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,119
the typing judgment for parents is that

827
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,960
the empty pattern is the pattern that

828
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,240
contains no events

829
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,079
if you add an event to a pattern you get

830
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,000
a pattern that has

831
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,880
one more event

832
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,119
all right the typing judgment for

833
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,839
rhythms

834
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:32,000
a rhythm is parameterized with how many

835
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,040
events

836
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,160
and

837
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,118
how caused the grid

838
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,839
the tablet rule

839
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:42,880
states a subdivision and a pattern

840
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,320
and the rhythm

841
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
has

842
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,760
as many events as the pattern but the

843
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,640
subdivision is the product

844
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,359
of the subdivisions let's say

845
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,920
we have eight notes which we wrote by

846
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,240
separating time into four equally sized

847
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,320
pieces and then separating each piece

848
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,680
into two

849
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,480
so

850
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,880
computed the product of four and two and

851
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,599
got eight notes

852
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
likewise

853
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,520
i just got a note that we have 10

854
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
minutes left

855
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,720
so i'll go very quickly over this one

856
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
the phrasing

857
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,440
of course refines the grid enough that

858
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
you can separate

859
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,160
the grid into chunks that have the

860
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,960
duration of the sum of whatever you

861
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,920
separated for instance

862
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,000
for the shuffle rhythm we wanted to

863
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,319
separate our two eighth notes into five

864
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,640
equally sized parts

865
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,440
right so we multiply the number of

866
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,000
events happening and the costness of the

867
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,040
grid by five

868
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,800
moving rhythms ahead and behind doesn't

869
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,640
change that duration

870
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,920
it just

871
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,200
changed where they are realized in time

872
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,560
and

873
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,040
the duration of

874
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,440
the sequence of two rhythms is of course

875
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,640
the sum

876
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,640
of the events

877
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
with this extra rule that refines the

878
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,960
grid the grid is refined to the least

879
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,200
common multiple of the coarseness of the

880
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,759
two grids

881
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,800
there's also a typing judgment for

882
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,520
grooves

883
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,119
a signature is just a groove with which

884
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,760
requires

885
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,480
a coarseness of the grid and a number of

886
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,800
events

887
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,200
a voice

888
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,839
just has the same duration as the rhythm

889
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,480
that says that it's associated with and

890
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,040
repeating a

891
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,440
groove just multiplies the number of

892
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,720
events by how far

893
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,079
all right

894
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,400
and

895
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,680
well

896
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,319
the sequence and sim and simultaneous

897
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,000
operators

898
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,319
have typing rules very similar to those

899
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,960
of rhythms but you can ask me questions

900
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,440
afterwards

901
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,720
all right

902
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,720
now we'll have a demonstration running

903
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,400
and

904
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,920
here

905
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,200
i typed in

906
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,800
some world music

907
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,920
there's a canarwin rhythm from morocco

908
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,880
africans on clever rhythm a pulsating

909
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,240
it's like a reggae

910
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,599
bass drum pulse

911
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,079
a hip-hop shuffle hi-hat

912
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,560
and a backbeat which makes everything

913
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,078
sound a little bit more pop

914
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,839
and why while it's playing

915
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,359
i'll take questions

916
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,880
here

917
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,560
all right it's playing in a while

918
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,119
because it just has to type check we

919
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,480
will not

920
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,000
inspect the type of this rhythm

921
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,880
all right

922
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,359
coming up

923
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,119
all right yeah

924
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,640
so here is the gnawing

925
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,839
shaker pattern

926
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,599
all right and while that's playing i

927
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,119
think it'll be playing for three or five

928
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,480
minutes i'll take questions

929
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,760
if there are any

930
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,000
yeah

931
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,839
yeah

932
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:21,160
any questions

933
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,119
um so you have the signature statement

934
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,520
for for groups couldn't you also express

935
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,839
that by simply stating the type of the

936
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,200
term that you have like you would

937
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,280
normally do an actor

938
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,800
instead of having it as part of your

939
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,200
language

940
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,560
the type of signature

941
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,640
so the signature term itself

942
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,720
it only it looks like it's only sort of

943
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,760
enforcing the type yes yeah but why

944
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,680
doesn't you can you just say for example

945
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,480
that beat has the type groove

946
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,599
4 4 and then the normal actor type

947
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:03,599
checker would sort of enforce it

948
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,440
that's a good question

949
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,800
you cannot

950
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,370
so

951
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,720
[Music]

952
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,680
but i'll explain why

953
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,640
all right

954
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,520
so

955
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,040
it's because when you state the

956
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,079
signature you state that it can fit into

957
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,040
four quarter notes

958
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,839
which will hold even though you state a

959
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,920
rhythm which cannot be contained in a

960
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,560
four grid

961
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:29,960
so

962
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,760
128 or 128 rhythm will still fit into

963
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,520
the type signature 4 4.

964
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,760
but if you put 4 4 in the type signature

965
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,680
you will get an error that 4 is not 128.

966
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,720
anyone else

967
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,920
no

968
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,000
then i think we should give your kim a

969
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,970
big hand for this excellent presentation

970
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:05,920
[Applause]

971
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,000
you
