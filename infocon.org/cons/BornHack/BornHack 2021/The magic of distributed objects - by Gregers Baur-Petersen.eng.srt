1
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,360
there

2
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,289
[Music]

3
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,479
is

4
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
so this next talk is by craig gaspar

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,400
peterson who will talk about

6
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,320
the magic of distributed objects

7
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,479
or as the title says distributed objects

8
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,439
and magic which is basically the same

9
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,560
um

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,000
hello

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,079
um i'm going to talk about this

12
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,360
kind of probably slightly exotic topic

13
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
because it's something which i've spent

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,399
about 10 years of my life on

15
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,000
i'm

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
my background is anthropology i'm an

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,040
anthropologist i've done research in

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
the world of open source software and

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,880
and

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,680
property relations and ownership

21
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
models and and so forth for a long time

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,479
um

23
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,399
at some point you always end up in that

24
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,598
situation that you have a life which has

25
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,280
to work which means you have to be able

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
to pay bills and

27
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
support your kids and stuff like that

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
and that made me

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
choose to leave academia and become a

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,239
cis admin instead of

31
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,120
you know

32
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,599
salary every month super

33
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,760
um but

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,160
i still have this

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,280
interest

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,470
as an anthropologist

37
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,840
[Music]

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,760
on existence of magic

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
and

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,560
distributed objects

41
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
and i will get into what i actually mean

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
with this and how this is actually

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
related to

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,480
free software and the production of free

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
software and in particular the

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
production of free software within a

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,519
project known as openwrt

48
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,200
i've for

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,280
a number of years i was a member of the

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,360
court open wlt core team

51
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,159
to be honest i'm not much of a coder

52
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,360
i'm actually

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
probably the best in terms of technical

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,239
things

55
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,760
is that i'm really good at breaking

56
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,040
stuff

57
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,599
and it's a challenge for me to fix it

58
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,800
again

59
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,599
but i try

60
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,159
so i did a lot of other things

61
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,879
and

62
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,799
one of the things that interested me was

63
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:27,920
actually

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
how do i understand

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,840
the model of ownership and and the

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,200
relationships

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,840
around property

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
in this context

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,159
but to start that

70
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,840
the title is distributed optics and

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,599
magic and

72
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,480
see if this changes yes

73
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,360
i have come up with a short definition

74
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
of magic and of course of sorcery

75
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,319
and sorcery is also important and

76
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,840
magic is basically about enchanting

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,560
people convincing them without it being

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,319
obvious to them that they should do

79
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,599
something else that they should

80
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,720
experience

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,319
certain things or they should act in

82
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
specific ways

83
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,519
whereas sorcery is the dark art

84
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,798
it's about manipulation exploitation

85
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,478
um and

86
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,880
as an anthropologist magic takes up a

87
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
lot of space or used to take up a lot of

88
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,919
space

89
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,199
in

90
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,639
in the work

91
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,880
in the research because that was what

92
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
the primitive people were all about

93
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,759
magic and strange ways of organizing

94
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,960
their lives

95
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,800
and cosmology

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
in

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,199
very strange ways

98
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,960
and

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,120
this actually led me to think that um

100
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
is there still magic in our world or is

101
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,280
it not um

102
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,320
and how how do you how does magic find

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,560
expressions today

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,680
um

105
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
and this brought me to the concept of

106
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,000
distributed objects

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,120
which is

108
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,440
a concept which is basically taken from

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
an anthropological discussion of art

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,199
objects

111
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,120
that

112
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,360
you have certain objects it could be a

113
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,960
painting it could be a figure it could

114
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,120
be as i started out with a canoe

115
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
made by

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,039
a tribe in papua new guinea

117
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,639
and it's not just a canoe it's much more

118
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,120
and these objects when you look at them

119
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,520
they contain qualities and intent of

120
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,560
people

121
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
and

122
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,639
with the intention that these

123
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,039
objects should

124
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,440
bring on or bring with them the power

125
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,039
and intent of

126
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,160
the producer or the owner

127
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,039
and

128
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,880
so that it should give

129
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,759
the people who the person who meet or

130
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,759
engage with a certain object

131
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,600
um

132
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
a certain experience or make them act in

133
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,639
specific ways

134
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,960
and uh typically distributed objects are

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
placed in circulation they have to be

136
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,600
visible

137
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,319
um and

138
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,600
and the intent is to enchant people

139
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,199
and now i'm kind of getting over to

140
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,160
magic

141
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,600
and

142
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,720
and

143
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
it's about and that these objects are

144
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,800
intended to enchant people and have them

145
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
act

146
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,360
and understand the world in a specific

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,639
way

148
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,280
to give them experiences and

149
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,799
to inspire them

150
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,000
and this brings to uh

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,800
me to free software and ownership

152
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,639
which was as i said

153
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,199
the beginning of all of this

154
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,440
and there's a basic question why do

155
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
people give away source code

156
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,840
that's that was when i started my

157
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,240
project in the early 2000s it was like

158
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,919
the big thing

159
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,880
we can

160
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,199
it's really difficult to understand why

161
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,360
why are these people doing all this work

162
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,240
and just giving it away for free

163
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
is it about in classical anthropological

164
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,319
terms uh gift giving reciprocity

165
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,680
is it about

166
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,479
community social relations

167
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,960
uh or is it more about like an economic

168
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,240
sense that

169
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
if i give something into the big cooking

170
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
pot there will be more for me because

171
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,720
everybody else is also putting stuff in

172
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,639
there

173
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,160
is it just about license requirement to

174
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
to be in compliance with licensing open

175
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,280
source licensing or is it a mystery

176
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
and there wasn't any clear-cut

177
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,800
understanding of this why are people

178
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,360
doing it

179
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,039
and i was wondering about this and then

180
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
something really nice happened

181
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,239
this one came along

182
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,599
and

183
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,840
somebody really up at linksys so

184
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,319
they ended up having to be forced to

185
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
release the gpl source code

186
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,639
and that was in october 2003 that it

187
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,400
really took off

188
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,599
and

189
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,919
suddenly everyone was like into hey

190
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,520
let's hack this thing

191
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,879
let's do something about it let's find

192
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
out what we can do with it

193
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
and that brought

194
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,520
the open wrt project along

195
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,280
it came out of this that suddenly there

196
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
was source code available you start

197
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,300
people starting

198
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,599
[Music]

199
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,440
put taking apart and putting it back

200
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
again in strange ways

201
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,599
and

202
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,640
the linksys wrt 54g was like the thing

203
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,159
to do that with at that point in time

204
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,039
and

205
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,399
this brought me to

206
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,760
openwrt

207
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,839
as a project as an organization as an

208
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,200
orc

209
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
and i started looking at ownership and

210
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
property relations there then okay

211
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,360
they're

212
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,399
producing something

213
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,800
they actually make themselves

214
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
like there wasn't any open wrt before so

215
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,240
they started making it by cooperating

216
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880
and by themselves putting code together

217
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,040
writing code and they do it through work

218
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,640
and play

219
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
and

220
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,519
that was kind of like what do they

221
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,120
actually make okay they write code but

222
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,839
but what does that actually mean because

223
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,399
what is our what is all of this about

224
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,959
and um what i was starting

225
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,640
at some point i started looking are okay

226
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,519
maybe it's about that they

227
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,720
are

228
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,600
manifesting their ownership

229
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,880
through the creation of a territory

230
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
the project itself the source codes

231
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,720
repository

232
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
they are expressing authority

233
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,920
like the right to control

234
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,760
specifically who has the rights to

235
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,680
engage with this code who has the rights

236
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
to commit

237
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
um and so forth so that's could be in a

238
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
way of understanding by by these notions

239
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,240
of territory authority and rights

240
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
what is actually going on here

241
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,440
and what

242
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
kind of

243
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,640
really was like the breaking point here

244
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,839
was

245
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,680
i don't know if you ever

246
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,760
saw this one

247
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
it's uh

248
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,720
it's the open wrt

249
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,120
the main developer the

250
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
mbm initiated the open wit project

251
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
and

252
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,160
he actually revokes the right

253
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,360
to use the openwrt code from one

254
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
specific company

255
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,279
trent which is actually one specific

256
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,680
person

257
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600
who broke

258
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,399
the license requirements

259
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,079
and

260
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,320
i was like one point what the this

261
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
is not something that happens very often

262
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
i don't know if you you've ever seen

263
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,680
anybody revoke somebody's

264
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,399
right to use a specific piece of source

265
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,640
code

266
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,839
i think this is my only example of it

267
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
and it was very very public

268
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,440
and

269
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,640
what happened there was that

270
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,880
this this code is circulating

271
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,920
um

272
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,480
and the developers from the openwrt

273
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
project they place their code into

274
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
circulation they make it freely

275
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,320
available

276
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,519
and

277
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,200
they don't as such has any they don't

278
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
have any intent of of creating

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,160
relationships with everyone who is using

280
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
this code they don't expect that

281
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,000
everyone will bring it back to them

282
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,959
again

283
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,959
they kind of have an ex thing okay

284
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,000
normally

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,079
bits and pieces will kind of return

286
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,480
somehow there's a

287
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,880
sense of

288
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,639
that you have to kind of maintain the

289
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,720
project which again requires that you

290
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
can attract developers

291
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,720
so this whole thing about

292
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,839
circulation is is both

293
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,720
about

294
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,279
placing your work publicly visible

295
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,720
and by that maintaining your territory

296
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,680
maintaining your authority over it by

297
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,959
having your

298
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,279
copyright names and

299
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,399
comments

300
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
in the source codes itself

301
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:26,850
and

302
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,320
[Music]

303
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
and also maintaining the project

304
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,560
maintaining the territory

305
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,079
by

306
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,519
being visible by also by attracting and

307
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,839
helping new developers make themselves

308
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,160
and

309
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
this is about property relations

310
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,120
and free software is of course

311
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
very much about licensing

312
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
um

313
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
and uh

314
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,639
and in in that sense with these property

315
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,760
relations then as an anthropologist

316
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
you know there are lots of primitive

317
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
people out there and they are really

318
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,680
primitive in papua new guinea and

319
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,360
they're really great because they have a

320
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,680
a different way of of

321
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,600
acting with and understanding what

322
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,680
property and their relations are they

323
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,399
have a sense of multiple ownership

324
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,200
that

325
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,279
it's not like an individual like in in a

326
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
western country like in a capitalist

327
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,000
understanding of of ownership

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
it's it's about a group a family a tribe

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,560
a people who have the rights in certain

330
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,240
ways to

331
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,360
a given

332
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,279
something a given object which could be

333
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,320
a canoe

334
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
it could be a drum it could be

335
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
a shell necklace

336
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,240
but it's always

337
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,000
something which is probably publicly

338
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,279
visible

339
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,720
and it's it's

340
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
in circulation

341
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,079
like you have some very

342
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,199
fantastic descriptions of of one

343
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,320
um

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,680
tribal group who built a canoe and then

345
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,839
they sail it to

346
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,399
another village like hundreds of miles

347
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,279
away

348
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,279
and they lent the canoe to these people

349
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,959
as a display it's not about that they

350
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,440
get something back but they lend it and

351
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
this then you will see in some certain

352
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
in certain situations that this canoe is

353
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,079
then lent onward to

354
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,480
another tribe and then over time it

355
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,720
might get back to the original

356
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,760
but again this is about display of that

357
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,199
they had the

358
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,360
kind of the territory to create this

359
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
canoe

360
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,199
and

361
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
they had

362
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,399
their authority to do it and they have

363
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,560
the the right to

364
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
lend it on like circulate this canoe in

365
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,079
certain ways

366
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,040
as long as it is respected that everyone

367
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,240
visibly

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,360
knows that it belongs to a specific

369
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,480
territory a specific specific group of

370
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,760
people

371
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,560
and in in papua new guinea they have a

372
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,420
very strong

373
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,839
[Music]

374
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,399
stories and and actions around

375
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,399
situations where people steal other

376
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,160
people's names and

377
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
stealing somebody's name

378
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,440
would be say is is very basically saying

379
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
i'm this is my property this this song

380
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,160
this canoe belongs to me

381
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,399
that's a no-go that's a reason for going

382
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,079
to war

383
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,199
and

384
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,440
they also have a

385
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,120
an expression where they talk about the

386
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,160
use of hard words

387
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,360
and these hard words are said

388
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,320
this is how it is

389
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,759
which will typically be said

390
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,920
you are no longer a member of

391
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,880
our

392
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,720
community

393
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,560
our world

394
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,320
and then you don't exist

395
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,880
as an individual

396
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
all your ties all the entanglements that

397
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,360
you were

398
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
part of before

399
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,600
they've been cut

400
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,800
so that is

401
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
effective that's in in in result it's

402
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,279
it's about

403
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,320
socially killing an individual

404
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,240
and that brings me back to this open

405
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,560
double urt comment

406
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,519
this is hard words

407
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,079
the result was for this owner of this

408
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,560
company swedish sweersoft

409
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,439
he went bankrupt

410
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
he was

411
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,680
held out as being an idiot

412
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,000
um

413
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
an individual you could not have social

414
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
relationships with

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,880
because he did not respect the ownership

416
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
of others

417
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,959
um

418
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,399
so

419
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,040
what the openwrt project is doing is

420
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,320
that they're

421
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,399
expressing their ownership through free

422
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,079
securation because

423
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,240
it is a way of showing that they have a

424
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,640
territory they have authority

425
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
and they have rights

426
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,839
and

427
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,400
if you want to

428
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
be part of this

429
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
you have to acknowledge that this is the

430
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
case

431
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,039
you have to circulate you can you do

432
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,959
whatever with the code but you have to

433
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,079
circulate

434
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,799
it

435
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,559
with the intent

436
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,359
of the project developers so you in this

437
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,880
sense it's uh

438
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,919
it's

439
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,640
the source code itself is is a

440
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,960
distributed object or a set of

441
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
distributed objects

442
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,919
depending on how you look at it and

443
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:38,720
this

444
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,200
object or these objects are

445
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,840
embedded entangled in the intentions of

446
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,039
the open wrt developers

447
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:47,840
and

448
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,880
by circulating it by keeping it visible

449
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,240
and by

450
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,360
having

451
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,080
this authority and

452
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,240
the expression of territory they're able

453
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
to

454
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
reproduce ownership

455
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
it's done automatically

456
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,679
and it's done without that they have to

457
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,640
have

458
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,960
community ties or social relationships

459
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,360
with the people who use the software

460
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,880
and

461
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,559
in that way for me it's uh it became a

462
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,720
image where this is about enchanting the

463
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,760
users

464
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
and the people who meet the source call

465
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,559
source code into doing and following the

466
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,440
intent of it which is to manifest the

467
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,080
ownership of the open wrt project

468
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
and circulating it

469
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,160
and

470
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,480
i think that was pretty much

471
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
what i had to say

472
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,679
very short maybe a little bit complex

473
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
maybe confusing

474
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,000
never know but

475
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,960
what else talk to me

476
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,360
any questions

477
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,080
um

478
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,600
you also gave the example of tribes or

479
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,559
small communities who would expel people

480
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,400
who misbehaved

481
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,559
what is different in the distributed

482
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,879
world

483
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,440
in in

484
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,880
okay um for me distributed objects is

485
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,360
simply in this case

486
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,480
you the openwrt has a

487
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,400
source code repository

488
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,799
it's freely available you can pull from

489
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,320
it

490
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,520
you are

491
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,120
not able to push

492
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,039
unless one of the developers accept your

493
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,480
commit

494
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,679
um

495
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,320
and so that there you have

496
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,919
it's distributed it's placed into

497
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,840
circulation you can pull copies you can

498
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
give these copies onwards to your

499
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
friends

500
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,799
or whoever you could do with it what you

501
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,570
want

502
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,080
[Music]

503
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,799
so you know where the territory is

504
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,799
where you can collect

505
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,320
the code

506
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,919
and uh

507
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,960
what you are actually then pulling

508
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,960
from the repository is objects

509
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,080
do you want you understand that and uh

510
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,039
you pull him by following accepting the

511
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,960
authority of

512
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,200
the open wrt developers and all the

513
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,760
other developers who are

514
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,400
upstream or downstream from them who

515
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,679
have committed code into their

516
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,960
repository

517
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,799
by respecting that there are certain

518
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,159
rules

519
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,120
you cannot hide you cannot steal the

520
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,640
name of the openwrt project

521
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,840
and that's an expression of authority

522
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,280
and then

523
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,799
the

524
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,799
by having this authority and by having a

525
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,960
territory the open wrt developers can

526
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,600
actually give you the right to commit

527
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,640
under certain copies uh

528
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,919
under certain situations

529
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,360
and

530
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
in that sense what you then are

531
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,720
committing you're committing back

532
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
objects back

533
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
so you're

534
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,400
bringing the circle back the circulation

535
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,360
but

536
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
and and in terms of of distributed

537
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
objects

538
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,080
source code is for me just an example

539
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,760
it it can be art objects that circulate

540
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,120
it can be

541
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,440
again as i said canoes

542
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,000
shell necklaces

543
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
and

544
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
basically what is circulating and and

545
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,960
what is distributed objects in sense is

546
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
for me typically something

547
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
which has to be visible

548
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
if it's hidden

549
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,120
if it's only like traded through back

550
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,720
channels

551
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
you kind of enter into something which

552
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,360
is more sorcery

553
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,840
it gets you know dark and like it's

554
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,000
something where you exploit stuff

555
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
and that was actually the for me one of

556
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,919
the the

557
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,720
important aspects of this

558
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,320
announcement that the openwrt developers

559
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,799
withdrew the right

560
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,440
to access

561
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
was because

562
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,480
the owner of swearsoft

563
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,840
stole their name

564
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,799
and

565
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,520
that's unacceptable

566
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,600
and and in that sense uh i think what

567
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,240
what is um

568
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,320
for me in this context is it's

569
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,440
in some ways it's it's difficult to

570
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,280
directly

571
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,559
compare

572
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,480
art objects and

573
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,320
source code

574
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,799
because they're it's odd object is

575
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,480
typically in a western context something

576
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,120
you buy and sell

577
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
so that you actually

578
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,679
have something which moves from

579
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,600
a singular ownership or a single

580
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,480
producer manufacturer to a singular

581
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240
individual who owns that piece

582
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,200
that's again a problem within the world

583
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,000
of of our the art world because at the

584
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
same time there's a lot of focus on

585
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,480
displaying but you have individuals who

586
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,520
who buy

587
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,679
a certain painting at a

588
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,440
auction and you never see it again

589
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
which is then

590
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,039
in some ways it's it's a problematic

591
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,120
because it's also about then stealing

592
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,799
something

593
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,840
of your cult culture

594
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,400
or the general culture

595
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,640
ah

596
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,320
that survived

597
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,159
um

598
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,320
so for me with with the

599
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,360
open source software is that

600
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,679
if you look at it in terms of

601
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,679
the distribution

602
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,080
that these objects are circulating as a

603
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,039
way of manifesting ownership

604
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,919
by reproducing who made this who created

605
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,039
this who placed this into circulation

606
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,720
then it it

607
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,120
for me at least it makes more sense than

608
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,880
looking at it as

609
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
something you buy and sell and and stuff

610
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,400
like that

611
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,520
was that enough of a

612
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,559
explaining

613
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,559
super

614
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,760
there's there's sound in it but i don't

615
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,120
know how it gets into it

616
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,760
hello

617
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,880
okay

618
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,600
great so

619
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,600
i think if you speak up i will repeat

620
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,559
the question as quick

621
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:23,019
[Music]

622
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
uh

623
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,279
maybe testing okay so

624
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,760
so so there's kind of a material benefit

625
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,120
to the software

626
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
um being free

627
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
um

628
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,279
and

629
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,679
i mean is is that part of the magic that

630
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,279
you're talking about or is it an

631
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,520
entirely separate social phenomenon of

632
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,480
of this

633
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:26,810
um

634
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,640
[Music]

635
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,480
the experience of having a territory and

636
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,200
authority within the commons

637
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,879
i think it's it's

638
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
this your questions about is is it more

639
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,880
or is it also about material

640
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,679
uh properties that it's

641
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,240
maybe a better product

642
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,919
i don't

643
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,760
i don't know if it always is is

644
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,240
something which is better

645
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,240
um

646
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,640
yeah

647
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,880
yeah

648
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
it's it's not that's that free software

649
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,320
is always better it's that for any given

650
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,399
software it would be better if it were

651
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,440
free

652
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,840
and so

653
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,039
there are advantages to to free software

654
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,880
and if we wanted to exist we have to

655
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,200
make it

656
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:32,720
but

657
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,480
yeah i mean do you think that that um

658
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,320
that the way in which it's better is

659
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,840
part of the social magic that you're

660
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,919
talking about or is it a separate

661
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,360
kind of phenomenon

662
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,960
i think i would

663
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,440
definitely question the thing that open

664
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,039
source software always is better

665
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
there's a lot of open source software

666
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,440
which is really good and then there's a

667
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,279
lot of open source software which from

668
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,360
my my personal point of view is really

669
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,200
crap

670
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,919
uh i think for so for me it's it's more

671
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,600
about that

672
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,279
you choose to

673
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,320
make your work visible

674
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,480
instead of hiding it

675
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,200
and

676
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,440
you actually create the opportunity and

677
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,480
the potential

678
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,159
that it could

679
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,919
engage and become

680
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,080
a territory which would in

681
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,440
include

682
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,159
rights and authority or you could say it

683
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,080
would able be able to come alive

684
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,600
for others than you

685
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,918
um

686
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,279
and so it's i'm not saying that i'm in

687
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,760
no way saying that you're wrong

688
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,679
it's just i think it's it's different

689
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,120
perspectives

690
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,679
and i think if something i i could be

691
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,240
i'm a bit critical towards that

692
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,840
free software open source software

693
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,799
always should be better

694
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,039
there's

695
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,200
it's just about that you have sn you

696
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,120
have a specifically you have two

697
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,520
different ownership models

698
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,320
here

699
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,799
you have a singular ownership model

700
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,039
where you say this is a singular

701
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,760
individual or a corporation which owns

702
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,559
this

703
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,799
and they have the right to hide it and

704
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,279
explicitly decide how you can use this

705
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,240
code

706
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,600
and then you have free open soft

707
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
software free and open source software

708
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,039
where

709
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,799
anybody can use it because it's freely

710
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,000
available

711
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,760
they can build it they can rebuild it

712
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,440
they can take it apart

713
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,679
and they can audit it

714
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,559
and

715
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,480
they can have other people audit it and

716
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,159
and that's more of that's more

717
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,159
specifically a multiple ownership model

718
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,080
there's more

719
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,640
than one individual typically who has

720
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,440
part in a specific piece of software

721
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,279
and

722
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,360
the only way that you actually

723
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,880
become there

724
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,679
aware of the existence of this office

725
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,279
piece of software that somebody has

726
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,279
written is that it's made

727
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,200
publicly available

728
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
it's placed into circulation if it's not

729
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
placed into circulation

730
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,879
it actually doesn't exist

731
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and it doesn't have a life

732
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,880
and i think that's maybe

733
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
for me that's that's the important part

734
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,440
that it potentially has a life it's not

735
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,279
you know their github

736
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,039
tons of things of git code

737
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,480
billions of codes of like lines of code

738
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,960
i don't know how much of that actually

739
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,120
is used apart from maybe one or two

740
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,640
individuals some of it is used a lot but

741
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,360
there's also

742
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,520
millions and millions of lines of codes

743
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,120
who doesn't have any life and if you try

744
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,799
to install it on anything it just breaks

745
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,279
my experience i'm old you know

746
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,559
so

747
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:03,760
and

748
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,840
there are some some commercial stuff is

749
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,799
is actually not bad

750
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,200
again depending on on the your situation

751
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,600
you're in

752
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,440
but again i i would at any point in time

753
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,039
prefer

754
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,919
something which is circulating

755
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,720
as my personal opinion

756
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,880
i i think i i'm just

757
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,360
i i don't quite see what what what the

758
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,399
magic

759
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:41,360
is that so so it's like the imagination

760
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
of being alive or the

761
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,840
essential magic is

762
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,360
about open source and free software has

763
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,880
is circulated with the intention of

764
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,519
keeping it in circulation

765
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,279
and with the intention that people do

766
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,760
something with it

767
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,840
that's

768
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,880
magic in my understanding

769
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,720
you are somehow

770
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,279
you know you stumble across this

771
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,919
whatever on github and then you think oh

772
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,559
great i i'm gonna check this out

773
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,120
and um

774
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,640
then it works for you

775
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
and then you tell your friends about it

776
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,840
you know post it on reddit or wherever

777
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,399
or you write a comment uh for the

778
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,600
developer or you push a fix you know of

779
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,760
some kind of patch to it and it gets

780
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,240
included

781
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,559
and for me that's actually magic that

782
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,720
you do that

783
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
because it's not it's again my personal

784
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,240
opinion is that our experience is it's

785
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
it's not something you you like think

786
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,440
about a lot

787
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,200
you know you know what i mean

788
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,640
you just kind of

789
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,640
do it

790
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,159
and when you do something

791
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:53,440
okay where do you

792
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,679
who's telling you nobody's telling you

793
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:56,559
so

794
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,399
maybe there's a magician there somewhere

795
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,960
who's like you know put some

796
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,960
special powder over this source code

797
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,519
and i think that's for me about

798
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,440
like this kind of that we are actually

799
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,519
living in a world which is contains

800
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,559
magic

801
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,799
it's about words of course and you know

802
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,320
enchantment

803
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,399
and that you can like suddenly be in a

804
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,000
situation where i thought oh what

805
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,799
happened there i never seen things in

806
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,480
that way

807
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,000
you know and that could be a magic

808
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,890
moment

809
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:30,720
[Music]

810
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,480
um so

811
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,679
you explained this in the beginning i

812
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,000
came a bit late but magic would you

813
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,720
describe it as um

814
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,120
a magic object is an object that induces

815
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,919
behavior in people by its existence and

816
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,720
about the story the sort of human

817
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
understanding of that

818
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,840
right and then

819
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,760
as open source license

820
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
piece of code is an object because it

821
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,240
has license and stamp

822
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,720
it this is a specific behavior

823
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,679
but does it also apply to any object in

824
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,720
the world

825
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,960
outside of these examples you've taken

826
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,279
up today

827
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,440
it can apply to any object

828
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,040
i would say

829
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,000
but again

830
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,918
i think it's it's uh

831
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,359
it's something you talk about you know

832
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,960
in branding and

833
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,359
and marketing and and with like you know

834
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,440
stuff you buy why do you buy something

835
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,040
specifically

836
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,679
you you can say okay this is uh

837
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,440
i want to

838
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,679
present myself in specific ways by

839
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,280
wearing

840
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,599
north face

841
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,399
you know i've climbed that north face

842
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,560
no

843
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,359
but

844
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,040
you might say is that

845
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,239
is that because that piece has

846
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,399
magic or is it because it's it's like a

847
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,920
commercial product where you have

848
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,680
learned somewhere that you have to wear

849
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,720
that or buy that or you're buying into

850
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,960
as a car and as a consumer

851
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,760
you're buying into

852
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,160
a certain expression

853
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,160
or performance

854
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,320
and

855
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,520
so you would

856
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,440
it's easier in that sense to to

857
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,680
identify certain objects as being magic

858
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,800
when they're

859
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,800
made by

860
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,400
individuals with the intent

861
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,720
of having you to use it and

862
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,280
having you to experience things

863
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,960
uh again as art objects or as

864
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,079
specific uh traditional cultural objects

865
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,280
which are tied into specific ways of

866
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,240
understanding the world which is

867
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,959
different from

868
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,560
commercial consumer-based approach to

869
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,960
the world

870
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,359
yeah

871
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,599
again they're different in terms of that

872
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,720
they express

873
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,599
two different ownership models

874
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,599
or models of ownership

875
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,280
a singular and a

876
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,760
sensor a multiple or

877
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,119
or shared

878
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,440
model

879
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,000
any more questions

880
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
well thank you very much for the talk

881
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,079
pleasure
