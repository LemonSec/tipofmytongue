1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,600
okay welcome everybody and welcome to

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,480
san san liverpool

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,519
and you will talk about

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,920
peerhood and privatization of money

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,600
yes um thanks a lot for coming on this

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
very early morning

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,840
uh my name is sunnyva and i'm i've just

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,519
finished my phd degree at the iit

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
university and i'm now continuing there

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,359
as a post-doctoral researcher at the

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,279
center for digital welfare

12
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,560
and i'm going to be talking a bit today

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
about research for my phd on how

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,880
hold on the dynamics of indonesian

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,520
ride-hailing apps affect how money

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,280
circulates through integrated payment

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,360
platforms and if that's a lot of very

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
long words don't worry there'll be more

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,960
we'll go through them slowly

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,480
and before i start i just want to give a

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
big shout out to the illustrator nadia

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,559
rizki who's indonesia and who made a lot

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,600
of the drawings that are in this

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
presentation

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,559
so

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
would you like a top up so throughout my

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,199
field work in indonesia i encountered

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,039
many variations of this particular

29
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,438
question from drivers of the ride

30
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,439
hailing platforms called gojek and grab

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,040
which are equivalent to like uber or

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,200
vaults in indonesia

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,520
and what they wanted to know was would i

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,520
be interested in purchasing some digital

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,400
money

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
from for my own digital account so in

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
practice it works like this the driver

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,439
and i agree on a sum of money

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,080
the driver then uses the integrated

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,720
payment mechanism of the app platform so

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,040
imagine uber but with a separate money

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,479
system

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
to make a digital transfer to my account

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
and then i give the driver cash of the

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,720
equivalent amount of money

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,600
i can now use my newly topped up balance

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,079
to pay the next driver digitally rather

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
than paying cash

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,920
and for those familiar with the more

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,560
seamless digital transactions of similar

51
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,520
ride-hailing and food delivery apps

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,159
this moment of exchange

53
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
between the driver and the passenger may

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
seem peculiar or cumbersome

55
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,880
so why not just pay the next driver with

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
cash in the same way that i am de facto

57
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
paying this driver cash to have a

58
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,399
digital balance

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,598
the fact is that most people in

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,080
indonesia do not use credit or debit

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
cards to make digital payments and so

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,120
this way

63
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,959
storing money as a digital digital

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,239
credit

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,920
and using a smartphone application is

66
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,840
becoming increasingly popular way to

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,120
have digital money

68
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
such mobile-based transactions are

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
sometimes referred to as peer-to-peer a

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,319
concept i'm sure a lot of you are

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,800
familiar with from the tech sector

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
and what they do in this context is

73
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,040
allow users to transfer money digitally

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
directly without using a bank

75
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,040
in indonesia the ride-hailing apps

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
benefit from having a fleet of what's

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,360
called like on-demand drivers who

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
operate as exchange agents like in this

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
top-up moment

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,519
and therefore they also operate as an

81
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,239
extension physically of the entire

82
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,560
digital payment infrastructure

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,080
lots of long words still it's early

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,840
we're going to get through all of it

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
so today we're going to talk about four

86
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,800
things first we're going to examine the

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
concept of peer-to-peer payment we're

88
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
going to understand what digital money

89
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,599
means in an indonesian context and we're

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,440
going to talk about how hassle-free

91
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,519
digital payment is experienced at the

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,959
interface level

93
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,959
and finally we're going to talk about

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,200
how these apps configure consumers and

95
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,840
drivers into very specific transactional

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,720
constellations

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,400
before we do that i'm just going to

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
quickly give you some context my

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,959
research is based on six months of field

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,000
work in jogja of city in indonesia which

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,040
took place between 2018 and 2019

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,560
just as digital payments were becoming

103
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
really popular and so i did a lot of

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,319
what's called participant observation as

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,920
well as interviews with drivers

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
customers the companies and several

107
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,000
stakeholders

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,439
but i also started to collect

109
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,519
screenshots like this one

110
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,599
especially with when drivers that i was

111
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,439
interviewing started sharing me their

112
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,599
screens to try and explain how they

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,159
experienced the digital economy

114
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,760
and so i started to begin

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,319
paying attention to these app interfaces

116
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,319
to examine how the app's design was

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,159
affecting my engagement not just with

118
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
drivers but with money itself

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,120
for example in this screenshot which was

120
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,839
when this app had given me a little

121
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,358
token to spin because i had made a

122
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,520
transaction and the app goes it landed

123
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
so i spun it and it landed on six points

124
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,240
and the app was like hey you know you

125
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,560
could have had 175 points if only you

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
had used gopay instead of cash

127
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
so the design of these apps is not

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,840
neutral it affects your experiences and

129
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,160
shapes your behaviors specifically into

130
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,840
channeling more money through the system

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,919
at the core of my work were two of the

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,600
most prominent indonesian digital

133
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
payment apps at the time

134
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
gopay and ovo

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,320
both gain traction as integrated payment

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,720
mechanism of the respective ride-hailing

137
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
platforms gojek and grab

138
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
gopay only exists as a digital wallet

139
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,960
inside the gojek app so not like mobile

140
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,120
pay here you can only use it inside this

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
platform

142
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
ovo operates as a standalone discount

143
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,600
platform for um an indonesian mall

144
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,280
franchise originally

145
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
and it also exists across multiple

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,680
e-commerce platforms today so it's kind

147
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
of like a white label wallet except they

148
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
keep their wallet or the label

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
so through the fleets of their drivers

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560
they have managed to convert customers

151
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,199
of existing transport services

152
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,160
into customers of financial services and

153
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,680
that's really really critical

154
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
so let's examine the concept of a

155
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
peer-to-peer transaction in more detail

156
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,199
and to begin

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,600
let me describe an advertisement that

158
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,759
gojek released for ramadan in 2016.

159
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,039
these are some stills from this

160
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,400
advertisement

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,479
you see a young girl she's asking her

162
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,000
mother if she'll be home in time to

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
break the fast for ramadan

164
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
as she dons her distinctly green gojek

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,160
helmet the mother gives her a small

166
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,319
package telling her to open it when she

167
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,039
breaks the fast we see clips of the

168
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
mother driving passengers to and fro

169
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
it's hot she's tired all these customers

170
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
are cranky and rude

171
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
her final passenger

172
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,600
is taking food to an orphanage for

173
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,360
ramadan of course

174
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,800
and as she watches all these happy

175
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,960
children the mother smiles despite

176
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,479
everything

177
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,440
meanwhile

178
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
her daughter opens the gift alone it's a

179
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,120
box of dates

180
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
and it contains a card from her mother

181
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,840
apologizing because they can't be

182
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,280
together the reason she explains in the

183
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,319
note

184
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,680
is that mom needs to make sure that

185
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,199
everyone else gets home in time to

186
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,880
celebrate

187
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,120
finally alone on her motorcycle and

188
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,039
having her first drink of water the

189
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,680
mother receives messages as customers

190
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,599
send grateful thanks and positive

191
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,639
ratings through the app platform

192
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,960
so firstly this advertisement presents

193
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,360
the imagined participants in the

194
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
exchange as two overarching categories

195
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,080
of user for the platform the service

196
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,280
provider and the service customer

197
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
secondly besides the green helmet the

198
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,400
company itself is hardly present

199
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
the app's role as an intermediate of the

200
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
exchange only becomes apparent towards

201
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,319
the end when the phone makes its first

202
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,080
appearance

203
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,720
instead the advertisement emphasizes how

204
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,280
these users are social equals helping

205
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
each other out in an important social

206
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,840
cultural and religious event

207
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,759
what it does not emphasize is the

208
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,520
precarity of the single mother who

209
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,440
cannot be home since she must work long

210
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,880
hours

211
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,960
instead it almost seems as if she's

212
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
doing this work out of a sense of social

213
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,080
responsibility towards her peers

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
notably money is never seen nor

215
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
mentioned

216
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,759
the word peer itself of course has a

217
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,080
very specific social meaning

218
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,759
and instead it generally refers to a

219
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,160
person or object of equal status or rank

220
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,879
to someone or something else and i am

221
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,240
particularly interested in how the

222
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,919
phrase peer-to-peer

223
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,240
which we know as a term from computing

224
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,639
came to describe an economic transaction

225
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,960
and how the retention of the term peer

226
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,599
in this context imbues the expression p

227
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,000
to p payments with certain social

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,840
meaning

229
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,680
firstly various definitions of the word

230
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
peer are all characterized by the

231
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,919
critical underlying trait that being a

232
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,440
peer is something that can only be

233
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,000
defined in relation to something else

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,720
secondly all uses imply

235
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
a sense of equality within the peer

236
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
relation whether it's social economic or

237
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,839
computational

238
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,279
originally used to describe a

239
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,120
non-hierarchical network topology the

240
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,279
phrase peer-to-peer or p2p

241
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,919
is not being more commonly used outside

242
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,240
of tech communities to describe diverse

243
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,320
types of digital value transaction by

244
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
financial technology companies

245
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,120
most famous is something called empeza

246
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,800
which is a form of mobile money that

247
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,120
originated in kenya which allows users

248
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,959
to top up their phone credits through a

249
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,399
network of agents

250
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,720
send this credit to others who can then

251
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
cash it out through the same

252
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
agent network

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,160
and this type of digital transaction is

254
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,200
usually what's characterized as

255
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,040
peer-to-peer because it allows transfer

256
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,839
of money to each other without the use

257
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,120
of a bank

258
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
a practice greatly valorized by the

259
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
fintech industry for creating access to

260
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
important financial services normally

261
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,120
considered inaccessible um to the poor

262
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
or socio-economically marginalized

263
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
people

264
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
so i'm particularly particularly

265
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,839
interested in how the phrase

266
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,440
came to describe this economic

267
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
transaction and how the retention of the

268
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,800
term peer-to-peer

269
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,480
retains these social meanings and i

270
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
would really love to talk more about

271
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,680
this with you both today and later

272
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,160
so a peer-to-peer transaction where one

273
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,399
person transfers a form of digital value

274
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,080
to another but the language of

275
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
peer-to-peer is prominence within the

276
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,600
use of commercial digital wallets and

277
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
perpetuates the idea of mutual exchange

278
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
in accordance with the p2p ideal of a

279
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,240
flat symmetrical or egalitarian

280
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,040
relationship without an intermediary

281
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,600
but this transaction to someone has to

282
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,760
happen through something

283
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
through hardware

284
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
services networks app interfaces agents

285
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,079
third parties

286
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,959
the intermediaries of the transaction

287
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,920
thus

288
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,839
rather than interpreting the two as a

289
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,839
numerical representation of the

290
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,920
direction of the transaction

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,839
it might serve an analytical purpose to

292
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,760
consider it a placeholder for the

293
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,040
intermediaries through which the

294
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,599
transaction travels

295
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
the apps

296
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,040
the simplistic representation of the

297
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
directional transaction implied by the

298
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,760
p2p acronym provides a superficial

299
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
rendering of the complex exchange

300
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,160
relationship it actually contains it

301
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
might instead be useful to understand

302
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
this term as a relational acronym where

303
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
the so-called peers on either side of

304
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,160
the exchange have their own relationship

305
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,760
as well as relationships to the

306
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
intermediaries

307
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,040
the use of the phrase peer-to-peer

308
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,079
rather than for instance user to user

309
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,240
undeniably also introduces all of these

310
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
implicit social meaning to the exchange

311
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,000
relationship

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,399
in the context of p2p and network nodes

313
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,240
peer is used as an alternative to the

314
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,760
hierarchical arrangement of a client and

315
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,000
server right but what is the equality

316
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
implied in the p2p of payments

317
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,680
are they peers of equal social status

318
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
is it that they are accessing the same

319
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
resource or are presumed to have the

320
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,079
same capacity for operating the

321
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,320
technology

322
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,839
is it within the configurations of the

323
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,360
technology that they're defined as equal

324
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,320
parties

325
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,399
or is this peerhood one that emerges

326
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,079
when all other aspects of their social

327
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,760
context are removed

328
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
leaving only equality because everything

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,839
but the fact of the exchange itself has

330
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,839
been stripped away

331
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,360
the term p to p

332
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
confuses not only these complex

333
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,560
relational dynamics but also obscures

334
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
the power that the intermediaries thus

335
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,800
exert in configuring the conditions of

336
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,959
the exchange relationship of the alleged

337
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,359
peers

338
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,279
in science and technology studies we

339
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,959
talk a lot about how the emergence of a

340
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,040
technology must also entail the

341
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,240
emergence of

342
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,760
the user

343
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,160
so rather than being a specific person

344
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,399
the user is a composite character a

345
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,480
caricature of what kinds of actions

346
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,720
those designing the technology imagine

347
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,560
its future users to make

348
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,200
a peer is of course also a user of the

349
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,279
technology but the term peer as we've

350
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,519
discussed introduces additional

351
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
dimensions to the person and perhaps

352
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
also requirements from the technology if

353
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,279
you're going to call your user a peer

354
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,120
what does that mean for your technology

355
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,399
what is it you're going to have to put

356
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,079
into that code to make sure that there's

357
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,120
some sort of equality in that

358
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,360
relationship

359
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
after all how would you configure for

360
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,240
peerhood

361
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,720
so by thinking about these self-declared

362
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,279
neutral platform companies and the

363
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,800
configuration of users into exchange

364
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,639
relationships we can really begin to

365
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,040
unpack the effect of the technology on

366
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,760
the many ps and the many twos within

367
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,320
digital payments in indonesia

368
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,880
which is what we'll do now

369
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,040
so to understand how the apps work and

370
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
how they're experienced in practice we

371
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,800
need first understand a few things about

372
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
the existence of digital money in

373
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,519
indonesia

374
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,519
firstly it's important to address the

375
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,360
fact that indonesia has been going

376
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,440
through massive economic growth since

377
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,120
political and economic instability in

378
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
the late 90s

379
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,720
but though the poverty rate has fallen

380
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
income and wealth inequality has also

381
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,639
been growing rapidly

382
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,120
presently the richest four men share a

383
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
combined wealth of more than the poorest

384
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,079
million

385
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,959
thus despite economic developments many

386
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,040
people still do not have or use a bank

387
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,480
account

388
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,399
the government has initiated multiple

389
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,920
projects to increase what they call

390
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,560
financial inclusion and in 2019 they

391
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,639
declared that over 75 percent of the

392
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,399
population now had access to a bank

393
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,360
account

394
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,680
a critical step one might argue in an

395
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,519
overarching public policy to become what

396
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,839
they call a less cash society

397
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,720
for most indonesians digital payment has

398
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,480
generally meant using a debit card to

399
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,720
make a payment at a shop or an atm card

400
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,560
which aside from making withdrawals at

401
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,920
an atm machine

402
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
also allows users to access their bank

403
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,760
accounts or make transfers directly at

404
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,199
the machine

405
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,120
for most people that i spoke with the

406
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,040
emphasis was therefore not on digital

407
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,360
money itself but on the ability of the

408
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
atm

409
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
to transition money between being

410
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,560
digital and tangible

411
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,880
as they needed it to be

412
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,959
within the population that has access to

413
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,279
a bank account only a minority owned a

414
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,959
credit card in fact according to the

415
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,399
global findex database only 2.4

416
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,160
of the adult indonesian population had a

417
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,600
credit card in 2017.

418
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
and for those who can pay by card this

419
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,720
is the type of you that might meet you

420
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,839
in a historic cafe

421
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,839
this thing that the machines are

422
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,240
standing on is called a terminal tree

423
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,560
it's a little structure

424
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,680
so

425
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,440
despite increasing interoperability

426
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,120
between banks and payment providers

427
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
customers using these infrastructures

428
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
from banks other than their own we can

429
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
still face substantial fees

430
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,399
and so for the people who are receiving

431
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,920
payments it becomes critical to be able

432
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,839
to provide for all of your customers

433
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,360
which is also quite expensive and which

434
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,959
means that those who can afford to have

435
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,560
all of the relevant terminal terminals

436
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,040
can and those who cannot

437
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,399
cannot

438
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,800
therefore each bank needs its own edc

439
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,920
terminal as can be seen in these

440
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,319
pictures

441
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,040
so whereas digital money stored in your

442
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,199
bank can be mobilized using a plastic

443
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,759
card electronic money or e-money was

444
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,519
given a distinct legal definition in

445
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,959
2009

446
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,959
as a type of digital credit balance

447
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,959
issued and stored by a private actor

448
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,199
e-money is issued based on the

449
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
equivalent value of state issued money

450
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
deposited by a holder to the issuer the

451
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,040
holder being the customer the issuer

452
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
being the companies

453
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
it is stored electronically in a media

454
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,680
such as a server or a chip

455
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
it is used as a means of payment to a

456
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,959
merchant which could be a shop cafe or

457
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,279
of course drivers

458
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,079
e-money is what apps like gojek and

459
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
gopay and ovo provide access to

460
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,399
it's a type of debt that gojek or ovo

461
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
issued to you and which they repay you

462
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,240
when you use the app to pay one of their

463
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,959
affiliated merchants effectively by

464
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,959
transferring your credit record to the

465
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,880
record of the merchant after which it

466
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,639
can be withdrawn again as cash

467
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,880
while the use of e-money has been

468
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,560
rapidly increasing these past years as

469
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,399
can be seen to the left it's worth

470
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,360
noting

471
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,839
that despite all of the hype of like

472
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,160
mobile-based transactions the amount of

473
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,480
money being transacted in this way pales

474
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,160
in comparison to the more conventional

475
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,639
uses of atm or debit transactions just

476
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,360
so we really manifest hype is hype

477
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,880
so

478
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,800
when the discourse surrounding digital

479
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,600
payments emphasizes the phrase cashless

480
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,759
or less cash as advocated by the

481
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,240
indonesian government we obscure what it

482
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,000
is that these cash transactions are

483
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
being replaced by

484
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,799
as digitalization draws attention to the

485
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,799
underlying infrastructures of money

486
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
particularly the concept of payments has

487
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,079
received renewed academic attention

488
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,160
when you make a digital payment what

489
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,559
you're doing is requesting the entity

490
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,799
which keeps your record of accounts to

491
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,799
alter that record and the record of the

492
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,160
person that you are making the payment

493
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,200
to

494
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,600
this generally takes place through banks

495
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,120
and various third-party payment

496
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
processors

497
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,080
thus

498
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,880
what happens in a cashless or less cash

499
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
society is the centralization of control

500
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
over payment infrastructure

501
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,360
where cash can be considered a public

502
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,160
state issued social infrastructure

503
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
digital payments are generally the

504
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,039
domain of private entities

505
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
though the money transacted through the

506
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
gojek app may be denominated in the

507
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,520
state issued indonesian rupiah

508
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
the tokens are contained within and

509
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,039
transported through their private

510
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,600
infrastructure thus these apps

511
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,520
not only determine the price to be paid

512
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,600
for their services but the price of

513
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,440
payment itself as we will see shortly

514
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
for the intermediaries processing these

515
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,840
digital payments the value in providing

516
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,600
payment infrastructure shifted with

517
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,400
digitalization from imposing fees or

518
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,480
rent in exchange for the service of

519
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,960
physically moving money to the value of

520
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,679
the transactional metadata itself

521
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,960
so when i purchase things through the

522
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,760
gojek app i let the app and its owners

523
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,760
know where i like to shop what i like to

524
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,679
buy what my transport routes are and

525
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,880
what i am willing to spend where cash is

526
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,039
anonymous and usable only by whoever is

527
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,240
holding it

528
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,679
digital money becomes hyper-personalized

529
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,679
the digitalization of money has

530
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,760
facilitated this unprecedented

531
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,240
aggregation of transactional metadata

532
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,559
thus to quote economic anthropologist

533
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,280
bill maurer for for intermediaries the

534
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,080
dream is for a system where value enters

535
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,559
a network circulates endlessly never

536
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,840
leaving as material cash

537
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,840
for gojek the self-declared goal is to

538
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
become a super app

539
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,440
an app that provides for all of a

540
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,760
customer's wants and needs by hosting

541
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
other apps within the overarching

542
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,320
umbrella of a single platform as the

543
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,000
head of the gojek data engineering team

544
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,600
writes on the company blog

545
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,520
the biggest moats gojek ever built is

546
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,600
payments once you're handling money for

547
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,360
a user you can build a castle of

548
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,200
services within it

549
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,640
the moat

550
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,880
this is not his quote this is me now the

551
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,280
moat is comprised of the digital credits

552
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,799
issued privately through the gopay

553
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,840
wallet

554
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,320
purchased using indonesian rupiah these

555
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,960
gopay credits can be used exclusively

556
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,760
for services within the gojek platform

557
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,160
thus it is gojek that controls the

558
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,400
metaphorical drawbridge which both gives

559
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,360
access to and confines money services

560
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,360
and people within the moat boundaries

561
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,760
so it's this expansion from a ride

562
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,960
hailing app

563
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,200
into the center of our social economic

564
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,240
exchange practices and the subsequent

565
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,320
dynamics that these platforms introduce

566
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,159
to the circulation of value that

567
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,000
increase that deserves increased

568
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
scrutiny

569
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
where cash can be exchanged from one

570
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,280
hand to another digital money requires a

571
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,679
little more infrastructural support such

572
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,880
as qr codes or the edc terminals we saw

573
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,240
earlier

574
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,679
and much of this infrastructure is

575
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,000
rendered invisible by design thus

576
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,159
allowing users to famously pay without

577
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,280
hassle

578
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
the underlying infrastructures become

579
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,720
concealed within these frictionless

580
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,919
aesthetics

581
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,080
so let's go for a little walk inside

582
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,600
this friction and free castle

583
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,679
when you open either the gojek or grab

584
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,280
app this is the home screen that greets

585
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,000
you

586
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,480
in both apps the digital wallet appears

587
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
as a menu bar at the top of the screen

588
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,159
which shows you your balance denominated

589
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,600
in rupiah

590
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,400
the menu allows you to top up or make

591
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,240
payments and lures you in with the

592
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,559
promise of more features

593
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,919
only to reveal that you have to be a

594
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,320
premium user to access features like

595
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
withdrawing your money or sending money

596
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,280
to other people thus for regular users

597
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,600
money stored in the app can only exit

598
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,840
again in the form of payment only

599
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,080
through consumerism can you use this

600
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,879
money for anything

601
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,960
if you want to top up your balance the

602
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,039
app specifically asks you to make a

603
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,440
payment using a debit card in other

604
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,000
words you are buying go pay credits not

605
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,480
unlike how you would buy a gift card for

606
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
a very favorite shop

607
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,240
and for those without a debit card or a

608
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
bank account remember not everyone has

609
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,640
those the app provides very detailed

610
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,320
instructions for a variety of

611
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,240
alternative top-up methods

612
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
first and foremost suggesting that you

613
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
ask your driver for a top-up which is

614
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,480
also the only free way to do so

615
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,799
as a customer the main way to interact

616
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,280
with this digital wallet is when the app

617
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,360
asks you to select a payment method for

618
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,880
in-app purchases

619
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,360
so in these images we see me selecting a

620
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,200
payment method for a car booking i made

621
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
in the grab app

622
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,200
to the left is the price if i chose ovo

623
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,799
the digital credit

624
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,960
as i don't have enough ovo i have to

625
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,799
select the cash option

626
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,000
noticeably the price changes from 4 to

627
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,799
20 000 rupiah

628
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
the interface

629
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,799
design also deploys color using green to

630
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,480
show how good and cheap the digital

631
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,840
payment option is compared to the more

632
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,240
neutral black used for cash

633
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,280
even worse having selected cash a red

634
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
notification bar appears at the top of

635
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,200
the screen reminding me that i'll be

636
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,840
missing out on an 80 discount for not

637
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,919
choosing ovo

638
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:48,799
thus

639
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,559
the presence of the digital payment

640
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,960
option is not presented as a convenient

641
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
or neutral alternative to making a cash

642
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,960
payment

643
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,600
and this is just one example of how both

644
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,440
of these apps aggressively encourage

645
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
users to pay digitally to the point that

646
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,440
one almost comes to feel punished for

647
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,840
choosing cash

648
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,919
and this affects how people use the apps

649
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,960
so by 2019 i was constantly comparing

650
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,200
discounts across apps i found myself

651
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,960
taking every opportunity to ensure that

652
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,360
my accounts were topped up to avoid

653
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,880
feeling as though i was missing out on a

654
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,200
cheaper trip and thus wasting my money

655
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
and similarly for most of my the people

656
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,520
i interviewed the real value proposition

657
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,360
of e-money was not the fact that it's

658
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,559
digital

659
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,039
it's the ability of this particular form

660
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,400
of money

661
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,640
to give access to cheaper services and

662
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,760
products

663
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,919
what the apps primarily give is an

664
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,159
access point for the type of purchases

665
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,919
that are associated with a middle class

666
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,799
life personal drivers discounted food

667
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,039
delivery cashbacks when shopping at the

668
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,720
mall like this restaurant where three

669
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
different apps are encouraging you to

670
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,559
use their particular form of payment

671
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,360
with

672
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,959
absolutely wild cashbacks

673
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,200
so how do drivers fit into this whole

674
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
digital money ecosystem so let me begin

675
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,039
by describing one of my absolute

676
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,520
earliest encounters with some

677
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,000
unexpected transactional frictions in

678
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
2018.

679
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,440
i had just downloaded the gojek app and

680
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
i had topped up my gopay wallet and was

681
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
trying to use the money to pay for a

682
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,919
cappuccino in a neighborhood coffee shop

683
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,400
belombisa a barista told me when i asked

684
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
if i could pay for my order with gopay

685
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
you can't yet

686
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,320
i had selected this coffee shop from my

687
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
neighborhood because i had seen it

688
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,919
listed in the go food section of the

689
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,000
gojek app and so i had assumed that the

690
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,440
digital wallet would be an acceptable

691
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,039
form of payment

692
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,440
the coffee shop only accepted cash the

693
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,799
barista explained but if i wanted to use

694
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,000
gopay there was a way of doing so

695
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
i could make an order for my coffee

696
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,960
using the go food tab in the gojek app

697
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,799
and select the digital payment option

698
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,279
rather than cash upon checkout

699
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,320
a driver would receive my order drive to

700
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,960
the cafe place the order wait for it to

701
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,480
be prepared and then pay for it using

702
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,559
their own cash

703
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,000
the driver would then bring me the

704
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,760
coffee and be paid for the cost of the

705
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,440
coffee and his time

706
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,840
using my go pay

707
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,919
balance this was my first encounter with

708
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,240
the entanglements of online drivers and

709
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,400
digital money in indonesia and my very

710
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
first confounding experience of the

711
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,880
peculiar limitations and opportunities

712
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,279
for transaction that had materialized

713
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,880
just through the interfaces of these

714
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,200
apps

715
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,080
when i started using these apps in 2018

716
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,840
i assumed that drivers and customers

717
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,360
shared if not the same at least a

718
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,880
similar type of digital wallet

719
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,159
infrastructure

720
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,000
after all i was paying with my gopay

721
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,520
wallet it seemed natural to assume that

722
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,200
they were receiving it in their gopay

723
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,159
wallet

724
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,400
in practice drivers use a separate app

725
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,720
entirely and it contains three digital

726
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,200
wallets as can be seen in this image

727
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,840
there's a credit wallet from which the

728
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,080
company extracts their 20

729
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,919
cut of income on trips paid with cash

730
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
then there's a cash wallet

731
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,279
used to store income from digital

732
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,799
payments

733
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,440
and finally there's a consumer wallet go

734
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,600
pay for gojic drivers and ovo for grab

735
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,720
drivers

736
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,159
to which they can then transfer their

737
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,840
earnings directly

738
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,200
and then use it through the consumer

739
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
version of the apps which some drivers

740
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,520
do meaning they can literally just

741
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,039
put the money they've earned directly

742
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,279
into the consumer wallet and also spend

743
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,720
it on things

744
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,919
very convenient infrastructure

745
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,159
for income to be useful for drivers they

746
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,640
have to make a request to the app to

747
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
cash out their balance

748
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,039
the company then debits their account

749
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,880
and transfers money to the driver's bank

750
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,120
account and only then can the drivers

751
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,120
withdraw the money as cash at an atm

752
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,000
notably this means that contrary to

753
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,640
customers all drivers must have a bank

754
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
account to use these apps

755
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,720
and if they don't have one gojek

756
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
provides them with one through their

757
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,720
partnership with bank central asia the

758
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
largest privately owned bank in

759
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,440
indonesia

760
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,400
truly banking the unbanked in order for

761
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
the customer to experience hassle-free

762
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,000
and heavily discounted cashless payments

763
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,799
when a driver tops up a customer balance

764
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,400
they're selling their own digital

765
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,120
balance and receiving cash in exchange

766
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,000
the apps incentivize drivers to do this

767
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,760
either by awarding them points which

768
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,760
count towards their daily bonus targets

769
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,919
or by giving them a digital cashback of

770
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,320
up to twenty percent of what they sold

771
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,480
as you can see here where the driver has

772
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,320
received four 000 as a bonus for

773
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
completing a top-up

774
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,799
one driver proudly shared that he would

775
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,679
nudge customers to buy a top-up securing

776
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,159
himself cash cashbacks of up to 100 to

777
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,360
150 000 per day just for selling his

778
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,240
balance implying sales of between 500 to

779
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,960
750 000 each day

780
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,720
curious i asked the driver what his

781
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,240
strategy was for maintaining such high

782
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,919
liquidity

783
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,080
in his digital account he argued that

784
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,520
for the most part it wasn't a problem

785
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,120
since customers were constantly

786
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
replenishing his account by paying

787
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,120
through ovo just as i had done for this

788
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,240
trip

789
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,880
incidentally i had just asked him for a

790
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,279
top-up equivalent exactly to the cost of

791
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,200
the trip itself because as described

792
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,279
earlier i too was concerned with

793
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,919
maintaining a digital balance

794
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,480
i had made a 20 000 cashless payment

795
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,000
using ovo to access a discounted trip

796
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
then i proceeded to use the same amount

797
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,320
of cash to replenish my digital account

798
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,520
in preparation for my next trip

799
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,600
as a reward for selling his over balance

800
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,360
to me the driver later receives four

801
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,120
thousand rupiah as a cash back to his

802
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,360
digital wallet

803
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
from the driver's point of view he had

804
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
received my digital payment and then

805
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
sold me the exact same amount back

806
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,120
receiving twenty thousand cash in

807
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,440
exchange but also receiving this digital

808
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,279
four thousand from the company

809
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,440
in total the driver earned twenty four

810
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,880
thousand rupiah

811
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,200
but in the process he also managed to

812
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,320
convert 20 000 of his existing balance

813
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,679
into the more useful form of cash

814
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,919
the irony of this cash-filled cashless

815
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,679
transaction was not lost on the driver

816
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,720
he laughed money goes around

817
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,559
it wasn't an atypical exchange he

818
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,720
explains like me many passengers chose

819
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
to top up on each booking

820
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,480
opting for smaller and more frequent

821
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,559
top-ups rather than maintaining a large

822
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,520
digital balance

823
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,840
so for drivers selling balance to

824
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,919
customers represents a really important

825
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,399
alternative way to cash out because

826
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,320
accessing an atm

827
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,559
can be quite inconvenient

828
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,720
by selling their balance drivers

829
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,799
instantly convert digital assets into

830
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,039
cash without having to wait for the

831
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,520
transfer to be processed by the system

832
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,720
meanwhile

833
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,360
the e-money tokens continue circulating

834
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,640
within the system and the company

835
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,159
doesn't have to make any bank transfers

836
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,159
at all

837
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,360
so operating on the front lines

838
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,840
of the digital economy these drivers are

839
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,159
doing all of the persuasive work of

840
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,159
bringing new customers into the digital

841
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,320
payment ecosystem of these apps on

842
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,840
behalf of the companies they're working

843
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,960
for

844
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,840
drivers are converted into on-the-go

845
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,640
digital atms for customers but they also

846
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,960
use customers as an on-the-go cash atm

847
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,399
for themselves

848
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,960
because drivers need cash

849
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,760
and therefore it is they who incur the

850
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,240
hassle of having to rematerialize

851
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,480
digital money into cash

852
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,399
thus in this system

853
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,559
drivers are the ones who take on the

854
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,640
frictions the risks and the transaction

855
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,279
costs of facilitating a hassle-free

856
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,399
digital payment ecosystem

857
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,480
and this becomes particularly clear if

858
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,640
we examine the moment of topping up in

859
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,919
more detail

860
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,320
so these screenshots show a top-up

861
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,919
transaction that i had with a grab

862
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,039
driver

863
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,720
once my booking is accepted by the

864
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,600
driver

865
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,440
the app covers most of the map with an

866
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,120
unclosable splash screen with a

867
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,799
dominating green button encouraging me

868
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,880
to top up my balance with the driver

869
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,760
fine

870
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,519
after clicking the button the next

871
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,120
screen informs me that i can request

872
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,240
between 10 to 320 000 rupiah from the

873
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,840
driver and it gives me the option to

874
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,279
enter a figure

875
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,960
the app now shows me this comforting

876
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,120
image with a sparkling green check mark

877
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
my request has been successfully

878
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,399
submitted

879
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,399
in the car the driver reaches for his

880
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,559
phone and almost instantly a new splash

881
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,480
screen appears on my screen telling me

882
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,200
that the top-up has been successful

883
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,519
and i hand the cash to the driver

884
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,039
but there are a few things that the

885
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,720
customer does not see in this

886
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,000
transaction

887
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,360
firstly

888
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,279
when the app tells me how much money i

889
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,600
can request the number it's showing me

890
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
is the entire contents of the driver's

891
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,840
digital cash

892
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,960
wallet secondly

893
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,799
the driver does not actually have the

894
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,720
option to decline this transaction

895
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,960
in the driver version of the app the

896
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,640
splash screen that appears gives him

897
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,399
simply the option to click a similar

898
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,480
green button that reads collect money

899
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,240
the button doesn't even say confirm

900
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,440
transaction

901
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,200
once requested by the customer the

902
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,279
transaction is inevitable there's no

903
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,640
meaningful agency here for the driver

904
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,559
in such design may not have any

905
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,399
malicious intent

906
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,440
but it reflects neglect

907
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,519
revealing that the contents of a digital

908
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,799
wallet do not truly belong to the driver

909
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,279
until they've been withdrawn as cash

910
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,840
instead the wallet is there to enable

911
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,080
customers to access and make use of

912
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,519
company issued digital credit

913
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,480
so

914
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,399
having examined how payments and digital

915
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,080
money work in practice

916
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,240
let's shift our focus finally to how the

917
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,279
apps

918
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,039
how the apps arrange the customers and

919
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,039
drivers configuring them into these

920
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,880
roles of consumer cyborg and driver

921
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,640
partner

922
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,399
to begin let's zoom out from this

923
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,159
particular castle for a moment with its

924
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,720
moats and examine some of the arguments

925
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,640
perpetuated by the financial technology

926
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,399
industry in the promotion of these

927
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,799
products

928
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,000
let me summarize these quotes that are

929
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,760
about or from the indonesian fintech

930
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,880
industry

931
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,519
publicly these companies perpetuate

932
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,519
perpetually make the argument that their

933
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,919
financial technologies will lead to

934
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,159
financial inclusion of those who are

935
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,440
unbanked

936
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,760
by bringing millions of people into the

937
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,399
digital economy as members of a cashless

938
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,840
society

939
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,480
and globally this is a really dominating

940
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,640
narrative surrounding the type of p2p

941
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
payments we're talking about

942
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,880
and it's an outcome of a global paradigm

943
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,120
shift that led to perceiving the world's

944
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
poor as a new and exciting market

945
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,880
opportunity

946
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
and these arguments are frequently

947
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,039
mobilized in favor of expanding private

948
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,360
money services often with support from

949
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,600
national governments as is the case of

950
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,720
gojic and the indonesian state which the

951
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,159
founder of gojek is now a member of

952
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,159
because he's become the minister of um

953
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,960
culture and education

954
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,799
it's presumed that by giving a poor

955
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,200
person access to financial services or

956
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,799
to selling their products and services

957
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,399
on such a platform that they will be

958
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,239
able to generate income and thus lift

959
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,399
themselves out of poverty but this

960
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,359
ignores the complex structural dynamics

961
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,199
that lead to social economic

962
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,440
inequalities such as the increasing

963
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,960
income and wealth disparities in

964
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,480
indonesia

965
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,879
and a similar logic logic

966
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,520
casts ascendance to the middle class as

967
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,960
a personal responsibility which in turn

968
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,440
construes being afflicted by poverty as

969
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,440
a personal failing

970
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,679
and these are stigmatizing moral

971
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,839
judgments which lead to the

972
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,560
legitimization of exploitation of those

973
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,199
deemed less financially responsible or

974
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,000
less diligent

975
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,599
a critical thing to remember is that

976
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,079
participation in a cashless economy is

977
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,800
not a universal experience

978
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,719
a technology that makes life more

979
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,960
convenient for some can greatly

980
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,040
complicate the lives of others

981
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,599
in practice these indonesian apps

982
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,599
reproduce specific ideas about

983
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,280
consumption that are at odds with the

984
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,520
visions of the marginalized and unbanked

985
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,440
populations of these same actors argue

986
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,280
that their apps will benefit

987
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
they reveal a certain positionality of

988
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,040
both their developers their investors

989
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,800
and their imagined consumers

990
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,119
particularly these visions reproduce

991
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,200
ideas about the modern indonesian middle

992
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,640
class lifestyle

993
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,920
and the type of

994
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,160
aspirational consumerism

995
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,240
that can demarcate you as having these

996
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
forms of social capital as illustrated

997
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,240
in this wonderful gojek advertisement

998
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,640
for their new pay later service

999
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,560
it's worth noting that a central

1000
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,320
component of how the middle class

1001
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,920
constitutes itself is through the

1002
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,839
employment of others publicly

1003
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,920
demonstrating the forms of affluence

1004
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,520
that allow them to pay others to do

1005
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,240
things for them

1006
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,040
driver partners notably are not employed

1007
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,880
by these apps they're mobilized in

1008
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,400
service of the customers and by

1009
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
extension the digital economy

1010
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,480
and as i point out in my research

1011
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,160
the loosely organized drivers were

1012
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,800
previously known as ojek and simply

1013
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,640
existed long before there was ever

1014
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,240
go-jek

1015
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,720
what these companies have done is impose

1016
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,280
themselves on an existing social

1017
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,359
infrastructure and provided customers

1018
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,520
with an easily interpretable interface

1019
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,880
for engagement

1020
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,280
and in doing so their platforms create

1021
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
momentary stabilizing parameters for

1022
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,359
exchange thus controlling the conditions

1023
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,560
of transaction

1024
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,000
that were already taking place before

1025
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,839
they arrived

1026
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,760
proponents of the gig economy and those

1027
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,920
forms of digital capitalism often argue

1028
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,760
that this is a type of labor that makes

1029
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,760
workers more flexible

1030
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,680
more able to exert control over their

1031
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,640
lives

1032
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,359
but in practice with gojek and grab

1033
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,760
anyone can easily and flexibly employ a

1034
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,359
temporary servant

1035
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,960
perpetuating what scholars like ray and

1036
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,720
kyung conceptualize as cultures of

1037
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,920
servitude

1038
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,400
social relations of domination and

1039
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,720
subordination through which subsequent

1040
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,680
dependency and inequality are normalized

1041
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,520
and reproduced through these everyday

1042
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,480
social interactions

1043
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,079
and this division and who is being

1044
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,680
served and who is doing the serving is

1045
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,440
most eloquently expressed by gojek's

1046
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,839
founder nadim makkarim himself

1047
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,240
during a 2019 fireside chat at an

1048
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,880
industry event in bali makarim makes a

1049
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
really interesting observation about the

1050
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,040
app he helped create calling gojek the

1051
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,920
operating system of the real world

1052
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,240
makarim elaborates you're creating a

1053
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,800
cyborg in our consumers that are able to

1054
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,079
not have to do the things they don't

1055
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,920
want to do and therefore have more time

1056
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,960
to get stuff done in life

1057
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,359
implicit here is the logic of automation

1058
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,040
which reduces time being spent on a

1059
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,240
process

1060
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,079
through this automation

1061
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,000
the app the phone and the driver who's

1062
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
tasked with doing those things for you

1063
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,079
all become part of your extended cyborg

1064
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,200
self

1065
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,119
it's interesting that the emphasis here

1066
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,960
is on how the app can serve those

1067
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,440
similar to makarim himself his emphasis

1068
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,760
on productivity efficiency and not

1069
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,280
having to waste your time when someone

1070
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,119
else can waste theirs for you feels

1071
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,960
remarkably revealing of his worldview

1072
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,720
and his orientation of one of the as one

1073
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,200
of the app's consumer cyborgs

1074
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,960
and characterizing what problem he feels

1075
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,400
gojek is trying to solve in the world

1076
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,400
makarim says

1077
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,000
it was simply a problem of mobility

1078
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,040
right

1079
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,359
how do you get a human an object like

1080
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,680
food or money or value to move in the

1081
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
fastest possible cheapest most

1082
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,320
convenient way using one tool

1083
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,400
his answer is the app

1084
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,720
but the app does not result in the rapid

1085
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,240
cheap and convenient circulation of

1086
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,400
people objects and value that

1087
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,560
circulation is facilitated by the human

1088
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,839
labor performed by the driver partners

1089
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,760
so when makarim uses language such as

1090
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,000
cyborg or operating system of the world

1091
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,839
he foregrounds the technological

1092
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,839
innovation and reinforces the idea of

1093
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,079
seamless automated processes by which

1094
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,920
this circulation takes place almost

1095
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,480
magically

1096
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,560
and go jake and grab are not the only

1097
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,079
companies that refer to their fleets of

1098
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,320
drivers as driver partner a title that

1099
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,680
demarcates a different type of

1100
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,280
relationship than someone employed to

1101
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,960
work for the company

1102
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,800
it was not uncommon for drivers to

1103
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,640
express their discontent with these

1104
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,040
conditions of the alleged partnership

1105
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,560
they were partners with the app company

1106
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,640
who relied on each other for income yet

1107
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,560
they were not equal parties

1108
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,640
when drivers sign up they accept the

1109
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,160
terms and conditions that come with

1110
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,400
working as an online driver however as

1111
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,920
many have pointed out

1112
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,520
those conditions frequently change

1113
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,440
without warning or consultation with the

1114
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,560
drivers

1115
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,960
there's no two-way negotiation

1116
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,560
they experience that the apps define

1117
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,040
them as on-demand robots their labor

1118
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,960
mobilized and channeled through the app

1119
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,800
infrastructure to serve the need of the

1120
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,240
consumer cyborgs

1121
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
and ultimately the financial interests

1122
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,680
of the companies

1123
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,359
so as one driver responded when i asked

1124
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,880
him what word he would use instead of

1125
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,320
driver partner

1126
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,520
servant probably

1127
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,000
in practice the social relationships the

1128
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,839
alleged transactional peer hood of these

1129
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,480
apps is heavily mediated by algorithms

1130
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,839
which lead to the formation of new

1131
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,160
transactional hierarchies

1132
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,920
in the final chapter of my thesis i go

1133
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,440
into great detail to document how

1134
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,359
drivers experience being mobilized as

1135
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,640
on-demand servants through these

1136
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,800
platforms i'll touch on just a few here

1137
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,640
because time

1138
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,880
firstly driver income is calculated by a

1139
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,200
set kilometer tariff which does not

1140
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,599
include distance to the customer or time

1141
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,119
spent in traffic

1142
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,440
this is supplemented by a daily bonus

1143
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,040
from the companies

1144
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,960
drivers earn points for each completed

1145
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,839
trip

1146
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,599
hoping to reach the highest of three

1147
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,280
tiers to reach the maximum bonus

1148
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,760
critically drivers do not receive this

1149
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,599
bonus if they cancel more than 25

1150
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,200
percent of trips

1151
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,400
though they may have good reasons for

1152
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,440
doing so

1153
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,359
falling below the euphemistically titled

1154
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,040
productivity rating

1155
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,480
means that they incur what's called a

1156
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,839
debt trip

1157
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,599
meaning that they must complete more

1158
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,359
orders in order to bring the product

1159
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,280
productivity rating up while the company

1160
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,480
holds their bonus hostage

1161
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,160
from the meanwhile customers are

1162
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,839
encouraged to exp to rate their

1163
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,599
experience after each trip so for the

1164
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,280
customer point of view

1165
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,800
rating a driver between one to five

1166
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,720
stars is a question of a few millimeters

1167
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,280
and a thumb swipe for drivers this

1168
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,960
transaction is a source of constant

1169
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,040
anxiety because less than five stars

1170
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,440
will ruin their algorithmic ranking

1171
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
and many offer customers drinks or

1172
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
snacks or engage in other forms of

1173
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
relational work as a way to ensure these

1174
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,520
good ratings in a worst-case scenario a

1175
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,520
customer customer might give a driver a

1176
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,119
one-star rating leading to automatic

1177
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,319
suspension

1178
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,079
for drivers this can be a temporary or

1179
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,319
permanent loss of income but critically

1180
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,400
some drivers also pointed out how it

1181
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,160
affects their access to the digital

1182
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,000
wallets and their savings which of

1183
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,240
course are also controlled by the app

1184
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,359
which employs them

1185
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,680
and access to digital wallets of the app

1186
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,440
is further complicated for those drivers

1187
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,560
who rely on third-party account vendors

1188
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,800
to register outside of the formal gojek

1189
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,920
system

1190
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,839
i first became aware of vendors when

1191
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:55,280
drivers would decline selling me their

1192
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,680
balance saying there was no money

1193
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,760
because they were with a vendor

1194
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,440
and what i came to realize is that

1195
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,839
vendors manage fleets of drivers with

1196
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,000
the using an app infrastructure provided

1197
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,440
by gojek

1198
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,440
and digital earnings made by the drivers

1199
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,440
have to be manually transferred to the

1200
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,040
driver's bank account each day by the

1201
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,240
vendor

1202
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,000
according to two employees of a vendor

1203
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,440
that i interviewed gojek provides them

1204
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,960
with a window for transfers through

1205
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,280
monday and friday between 10 a.m and 3

1206
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,400
p.m

1207
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,119
with an estimated 250 active drivers

1208
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,960
requiring daily transfers within a five

1209
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,040
hour window the two employees only have

1210
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,520
about 2.5 minutes each per driver so

1211
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,079
mistakes are pretty frequent

1212
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,520
and as they transfer these daily

1213
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,200
earnings they make sure to withdraw

1214
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
their own 5 cut of these earnings of

1215
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,400
course

1216
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,240
so there's this hierarchical difference

1217
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,319
not just an income but also access to

1218
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,480
and control over earnings between those

1219
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,160
drivers who are registered directly with

1220
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,000
gojek and those who rely on the

1221
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,680
additional intermediation of vendors

1222
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,040
more critically in march 2019 goja

1223
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,520
codified a system of unequal pay

1224
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,599
as gocar drivers woke up to an in-app

1225
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,359
notification of a change to the

1226
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,960
incentive bonus system which radically

1227
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,440
worsened their conditions for labor

1228
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,760
gojic replaced the standard three-tier

1229
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,760
bonus scale with a system using four

1230
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,400
different scales known as schemas a b c

1231
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,359
and d

1232
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,560
briefly

1233
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,040
schema a required fewer points and

1234
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,839
therefore fewer completed trips per tier

1235
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,920
but also reduced the maximum bonus they

1236
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,880
could earn

1237
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,040
whereas schema d required more points

1238
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,839
but gave the highest maximum bonus

1239
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,920
which schema each driver is assigned was

1240
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
determined by how many trips they had

1241
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,079
completed in the past two weeks meaning

1242
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:38,640
taking days away from from driving could

1243
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,319
affect your income for several weeks in

1244
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,760
the future

1245
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,359
some drivers speculated that other

1246
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:44,960
performance indicators such as customer

1247
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,720
ratings order cancellation or even how

1248
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,800
much they turn apps on or off might also

1249
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,200
affect these algorithms the result is

1250
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,960
the driver's experience of the value of

1251
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,880
their labor fluctuates depending on what

1252
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,280
schema they've been assigned

1253
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,440
even if two drivers both complete 20

1254
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,440
trips driver a will only receive the

1255
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,520
reward for 10 points

1256
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,599
they will not be compensated equally for

1257
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:07,839
the same work

1258
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,599
changes to the schema were a really

1259
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,119
prominent part of my discussions with

1260
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,000
drivers in 2019 and notably some drivers

1261
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
despite their own exasperations and

1262
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,680
frustrations with the system would

1263
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,839
differentiate schema a as being for lazy

1264
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,920
drivers and schema d for drivers who

1265
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,359
were diligent

1266
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,599
thus they were also reproducing these

1267
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,599
moral judgments that legitimized the

1268
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,280
exploitation of the poor in service of

1269
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,000
the middle class

1270
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,920
so to summarize

1271
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,079
the idea of p2p payments leverages the

1272
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,160
social meaning and positive connotations

1273
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,640
of social equality associated with the

1274
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,000
word peer

1275
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,480
obscuring underlying power asymmetries

1276
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,560
between the exchanging parties as well

1277
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,040
as the power that these companies exert

1278
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,720
as they define the conditions for

1279
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,319
exchange within the digital

1280
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,240
infrastructure

1281
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,520
furthermore

1282
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,200
the socially acceptable concept of

1283
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,200
peer-to-peer ultimately conceals the

1284
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,920
fact that this constellation is a

1285
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,599
transactional arrangement that is

1286
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,240
valuable to the corporation

1287
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,079
users of the apps no matter if their

1288
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,000
drivers or customers are tools for the

1289
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,240
platforms because their transactions

1290
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,920
lead to the circulation of both money

1291
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,920
and data which is where profits are

1292
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,119
derived

1293
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,520
thus for the companies the emphasis is

1294
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,040
not on creating equal conditions for

1295
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,880
exchange but on securing continued

1296
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,720
customer engagement

1297
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
and this is done by providing cheap and

1298
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,880
convenient services through the platform

1299
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,640
which depends upon the exploitation of

1300
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,560
labor and the displacement of

1301
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,400
transaction costs of the digital payment

1302
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,400
onto drivers

1303
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
and this exploitation and extraction of

1304
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,880
value from transactional metadata are

1305
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,640
what is camouflaged in the language of

1306
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,280
p2p and financial inclusion

1307
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,359
companies such as gojek and grab

1308
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,280
continue to receive a lot of attention

1309
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,200
for how they are revolutionizing the

1310
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,680
economy through digital digital um

1311
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,680
technology and how they are automating

1312
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,520
existing systems and empowering drivers

1313
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,319
by formalizing their service meanwhile

1314
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,319
they're growing into super apps hoping

1315
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:04,079
to be the main gateway for accessing and

1316
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,920
paying for services in indonesia and

1317
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,240
neighboring countries in southeast asia

1318
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,800
they have attracted a massive amount of

1319
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,560
international venture capital from those

1320
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,480
wanting to be a part of or beneficiary

1321
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,560
of this digital transition

1322
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,839
as the companies extend their

1323
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:19,680
monopolization of customers and

1324
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,640
transactional metadata

1325
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,800
a few months ago gojic announced a

1326
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,079
merger with another indonesian

1327
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,560
e-commerce company called tokopedia they

1328
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,960
formed the rather on the nose consortium

1329
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,960
called go to

1330
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,880
their stated goal is to be publicly

1331
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,640
listed on the stock exchanges in both

1332
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,960
indonesia and the us with an estimated

1333
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,240
value of up to 40 billion us dollars

1334
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,960
meanwhile in jogja drivers are chasing

1335
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,800
points late into the night

1336
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,240
stressing about managing their digital

1337
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,920
balances and worrying that customers

1338
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,520
might report them for driving a borrowed

1339
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,119
account

1340
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,359
so gojek and grab may argue that their

1341
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,040
digital technologies will alleviate

1342
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,640
these problems and provide the poor and

1343
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
disadvantaged with alternatives to

1344
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,640
conventional financial services

1345
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,319
in practice however

1346
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,480
as the companies chase profits and

1347
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,640
market monopolization the structure of

1348
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,359
this money system reinforces social

1349
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,359
economic hierarchies and attempts to

1350
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,119
further enclose people within the moat

1351
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,119
of digital payments

1352
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,800
thank you

1353
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:27,389
[Applause]

1354
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,279
any questions

1355
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,720
hi it seems there's a lot of value

1356
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,400
within these companies and we've seen a

1357
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,160
lot of other hacks around the world of

1358
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,559
bitcoin exchanges which this is a bit of

1359
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,520
similarity too and it seems to be easier

1360
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,920
to break into their systems and perhaps

1361
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,240
inflate it or give all the drivers on

1362
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,599
the bonus

1363
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,359
has that happened or

1364
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,359
not

1365
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,040
okay

1366
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,960
so um

1367
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,200
is it possible to imagine a

1368
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,280
digital payment system that does not

1369
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,760
have this kind of exploitation or are we

1370
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
doing to forever have

1371
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,040
um

1372
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,040
exploitation be an intrinsic part of

1373
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,480
digital payments and should we just all

1374
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,240
go back to cash and never use technology

1375
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,319
again

1376
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,599
are we doomed maybe

1377
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,319
um no i mean

1378
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,680
i don't think that there is like a

1379
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,520
deterministic outcome here like digital

1380
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,680
payments doesn't have to be negative i

1381
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,800
think what's really important is to

1382
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,160
focus on what the people are saying as

1383
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,760
well right that the emphasis here is not

1384
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,359
on something being digital or being cash

1385
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,880
it's about the ability to flexibly

1386
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,720
transition according to what suits your

1387
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,280
needs and so from a designer point of

1388
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,680
view the purpose is to serve those needs

1389
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,599
right to create that flexible system

1390
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,760
that enables people to have the type of

1391
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,760
or money form that they actually need

1392
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,960
what's the issue with these kind of apps

1393
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,880
is the way that they

1394
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,640
decidedly are not neutral in the way

1395
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,000
that they like

1396
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,920
don't just model existing transaction

1397
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,520
but actually engineer forms of

1398
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,520
transactions right so of course you

1399
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,200
could design something different

1400
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,640
whether or not you can change what has

1401
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,400
already been made i think is more

1402
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,960
complicated

1403
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,200
thank you so much it was wonderful to

1404
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,000
hear

1405
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,760
such a brilliant talk

1406
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
i would like to ask if you're seeing in

1407
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,000
the danish context something that

1408
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,480
resembles this peer-to-peer

1409
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,640
philosophy

1410
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,118
anywhere

1411
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,079
that's a great question i mean i think

1412
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,119
um

1413
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:46,880
a lot of the narratives around financial

1414
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,079
inclusion those kind of things that's a

1415
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:49,680
type of hype that also exists in danish

1416
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,040
companies for sure

1417
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,119
um a lot of the advocacy about how these

1418
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,400
kind of payment systems will make our

1419
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,640
lives easier and more convenient

1420
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,800
also obscure like the fundamental fact

1421
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,559
that we're opting into a private

1422
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,800
transactional infrastructure and

1423
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,240
the way that those things are often

1424
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,000
being promoted as being a better

1425
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,520
alternative to cash i think is

1426
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,040
almost malignant

1427
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,680
to be honest i also think something that

1428
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,200
hasn't quite happened here right because

1429
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,640
in indonesia you don't have credit cards

1430
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,599
you can't have a system like mobile pay

1431
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,119
but that doesn't mean that companies

1432
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,400
like vault or uber and these kind of

1433
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,200
things are not going to start

1434
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,119
introducing similar systems

1435
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,400
and it would be super interesting to

1436
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,160
know more about how money actually

1437
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,760
exists within a system like vault for

1438
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,760
example if you get you pay for something

1439
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,119
and they can't deliver so they kind of

1440
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,280
give you a you know money to store in

1441
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,960
that system i would love to find out

1442
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,160
more about how that actually works in

1443
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,160
practice

1444
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,359
have the government interfered in any

1445
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,640
way or any larger

1446
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,559
yeah the national bank has a

1447
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,119
national non a less cash movement

1448
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:00,960
so the interference is definitely in

1449
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,720
favor of these companies

1450
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,079
absolutely

1451
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:05,680
i mean originally when gojek started

1452
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,000
there was a massive like the government

1453
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,160
actually tried to shut them down

1454
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,920
but there was such a mobilization like a

1455
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,079
million drivers protested and so they

1456
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,240
simply had to allow it to exist

1457
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,839
and the reality is that there are really

1458
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,680
close ties right politically between

1459
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,160
these ceos and the political class like

1460
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,960
i said the founder is a minister now

1461
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,880
um and so are a lot of other actually

1462
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,960
the the new president or the

1463
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,800
the president who was reelected in 2019

1464
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,559
brought in a bunch of young tech people

1465
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,400
like startup people to come and be a

1466
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,559
part of his cabinet

1467
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,680
they're really going to do it it's going

1468
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,359
to be a digital country for sure it's

1469
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,598
great

1470
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,720
okay thank you very much thank you thank

1471
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,279
you so much for coming

1472
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,730
[Applause]

1473
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,160
you
