1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,920
hey everyone it's spacebar from the

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,280
chick on crew

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,520
today is going to be a walkthrough of

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,839
the it's a great day for easter eggs

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,480
video

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,000
we released this april 4th 2021

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,080
the walkthrough is to help ensure that

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,720
everybody has full access to

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,760
all of the hidden bits that are related

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,880
to this video

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,960
because those are going to be the core

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,720
components that build

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,119
the rest of the puzzles in the videos

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,000
that follow

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,679
the april 4th video the video

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,440
uh has only one easter egg in itself

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,200
and that is during this part here where

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,040
uh there's a little bit of morse code

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,640
that starts happening so we're gonna

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,079
download this video so we can find that

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,360
morse code and

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
uh convert that to something that we can

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,879
actually use

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,600
so we'll open up the vlc media player

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,920
and paste the url

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,520
from youtube into here 7 25

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,800
1 6 42 8.

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,040
now we're going to check out the

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,240
information of the

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,799
video 29 and that'll give us the actual

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
location online

32
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
select that 27 copy it 27 39

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,080
and we'll go back to the web browser

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,119
we're going to

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,000
paste that into here and that'll give us

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,320
the

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,560
actual video location and allow us to

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
save it

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,720
we'll just save it as video playback for

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
now

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,279
we see it's done

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,960
so now we're just going to open up that

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,840
video you can hear the morse code here

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,520
we'll open up the local video that we've

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,079
downloaded

46
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,200
we're just going to skip through the

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
video here really quick make sure that

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,079
we have

49
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,520
everything check the morse codes there

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,439
so we have the whole video now we're

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,479
going to

52
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,840
export the audio from this file

53
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
so we'll add the file in

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,400
and we're going to convert it to an mp3

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,720
we'll pick a new video name for that

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
put it on the desktop so it's easy to

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,959
find and we'll just call this

58
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,040
easter egg or easter

59
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,840
and the conversion process is pretty

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,959
quick

61
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,599
we're done with vlc media player and now

62
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,000
we'll go

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
over to audacity

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,400
we'll open up that wav file or sorry the

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
mp3 file that we just did

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
and we're going to convert that to a wav

67
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
file

68
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,879
the first thing you'll notice here is on

69
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
the one channel the full sound runs all

70
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,400
the way through however

71
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,640
there's this one chunk here where it's

72
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,080
got a little bit of weirdness and this

73
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,760
is where the mp3 is so

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
again or the morse code is we're going

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,760
to cut out the beginning of this file

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
and then we'll cut out the end of the

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,519
file so we're left with just the morse

78
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,319
code

79
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,920
and the sound on the other side

80
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,080
now what we're going to do is we're

81
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,319
going to balance or change the balance

82
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:32,879
on this

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,720
27. and let's start by turning the

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,480
volume up a little bit just so we can

85
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,319
hear the morse code a little bit better

86
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,239
and we're only going to want to hear the

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
left hand channel

88
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,159
that'll cut out this sound down here and

89
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,519
we won't hear that when we're

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,959
playing back the morse code we'll now

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,680
save this project just in case we need

92
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
to come back to it

93
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,840
we shouldn't need to but we'll save it

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,760
and after we've saved the project we

95
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,159
will

96
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,280
export the file now from

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
mp3 to wave

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,959
under export export as a wave

99
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,599
and we'll put that back on the desktop

100
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,760
as well just so we can find it easily

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,279
not worried about any of these things

102
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,199
because we're just going to upload this

103
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,120
wav file really quick to the

104
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,600
2a website that will decipher the morse

105
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
code for us

106
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,320
for ease of use we'll just make sure

107
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,520
that we

108
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
move the mp3 that we no longer need to

109
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,400
the trash bin

110
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
and now we'll open up

111
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,320
firefox and we're going to look for a

112
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,280
morse code

113
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,919
translator

114
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,360
for the morse code world and instead of

115
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
trying to type morse code we're just

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,440
going to

117
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,120
upload our audio to it so we'll

118
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,080
scroll down pick upload and grab the

119
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,000
file name

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,639
so there's our easter and we'll hit play

121
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,880
and right away we can see that it's

122
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,960
converting the morse code into a

123
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,919
web address for us

124
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
again we can only hear it on one side

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
because it was only it was only recorded

126
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
on one channel that was for ease of

127
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
decryption i wanted to make sure that

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,120
everybody had the

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,160
ability to go through and play this now

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,919
the other thing that we're seeing here

131
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,600
is a colon and some random letters

132
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,039
we're going to use that later as a

133
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,520
password

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,120
so first thing we'll do is we'll pop

135
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,600
over here to this url and see what's

136
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
there

137
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,639
once the website loads we're going to

138
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,080
see a wonderful

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,160
happy easter message from the chicon

140
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,479
crew

141
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
being you know a hacker conference one

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
of the first things that we're probably

143
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
going to want to do is take a look at

144
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,000
the

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,160
source code and as we start scrolling

146
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,120
through

147
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,039
we're going to see you know some css

148
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,759
some html the one thing that's

149
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,960
noticeable

150
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,560
is that there's this thanks allen aka

151
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
future boy from me

152
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,759
we'll have a quick google and find out

153
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,080
who this future boy is just because

154
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
you know why is it listed in the bottom

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,960
of this webpage

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
and here we see that alan has a bunch of

157
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
stenography tools

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,440
we can encode decode or compare

159
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,479
so that would say let there's a

160
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,919
spot for a password and if we look here

161
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,400
there's

162
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,720
the password that's supplied

163
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
grab that and we'll paste that into the

164
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,240
stenography website

165
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,479
i'll pop back over here to the source

166
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,240
code of the the webpage we'll have a

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
look

168
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,360
so you see that happy png

169
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,840
some weird bunch of letters and numbers

170
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,960
and then footer

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,680
we're going to take a look at these two

172
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,360
files here that have

173
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,520
weird random names rather than being

174
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
named what they should be like

175
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,639
background or you know crew photo so

176
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,199
we'll

177
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,479
take a quick copy of this and then paste

178
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,759
that on the end of the

179
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
url here so we can pull up just that

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,680
image

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,840
22. and now we're going to save this

182
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
image

183
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,520
once that's saved we'll pop back over to

184
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,039
the stenography decoder

185
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,240
and we're going to just check and make

186
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
sure that we manage to actually get

187
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,400
something that has

188
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,479
something in it so we're gonna check and

189
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,879
see what the payload would be so let it

190
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,639
guess what it is so we'll just submit

191
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,800
that and wait a second while it starts

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
processing to see if there's anything

193
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,840
hidden in there

194
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,919
as it un or decrypts

195
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,759
everything we're just going to have a

196
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,360
quick peek

197
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,599
at the at the files here

198
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,559
and we're going to see that it has a

199
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,799
format of a jpeg

200
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,919
but it also says that there's a zip file

201
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,880
in there so we're going to actually try

202
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
and save this file now

203
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,440
and what it will do is it will decrypt

204
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
the

205
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,560
inside and let us save just the zip file

206
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,920
because that's what it guessed that it

207
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
is so while we're

208
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,680
just waiting for that we're going to pop

209
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,040
back over to

210
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
the html here we're going to grab the

211
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
other file and download it so we're

212
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
ready for the next part

213
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
so here it's popped up and rather than

214
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,839
saving this text we'll save as

215
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
we'll just change the file type

216
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,080
afterwards we'll save it for now

217
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
just as out.text and now we're just

218
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,200
going to

219
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
pop in the other file and we're going to

220
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,399
see it's the crew file

221
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,760
and again we'll save this image

222
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,839
head back over to the stronger free

223
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,320
website

224
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,279
after we rename the out

225
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,720
so the first thing we'll do is turn on

226
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,040
the ability to see the

227
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:51,120
extensions changed

228
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
yes we want to change it and now we'll

229
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,040
open it up and see what we have inside

230
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
now we find ourselves with a one-time

231
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
pad pdf

232
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
so copy that out we'll drop that on to

233
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,839
the

234
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,000
downloads area open up and see what we

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
have

236
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,079
just use firefox adobe's not installed

237
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,200
and we seal it

238
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,800
we have a encryption

239
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,480
pad here for using specific characters

240
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,519
that we're allowed to use

241
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,320
now we'll upload the other file and see

242
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,880
what's in there

243
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
again we'll guess just in case it's not

244
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,800
going to be

245
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,240
a zip pile although

246
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,600
this is a walkthrough i can tell you

247
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,839
it's going to be a zip file

248
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,720
the other files you can see are just png

249
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
files

250
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,959
named normal so we're just going to

251
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,959
leave that alone of course in the web

252
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,560
page in order to help people out we also

253
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,839
added some hints

254
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,800
after the first couple of days and again

255
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
this one says that it is a zip file so

256
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,440
we're just gonna

257
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:15,519
download that really quick

258
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,720
save that file as well

259
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,959
so we'll head over and we'll just rename

260
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,599
this file

261
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
change that to out.zip

262
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,279
yes we want to save that and we'll open

263
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,040
it up

264
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,279
this has the one-time pad encryption

265
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,640
chart so we'll

266
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,959
copy that over here paste it back into

267
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,600
downloads as well

268
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,240
open it up

269
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
and here we'll find that we have the

270
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,959
ability to see

271
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,519
the shift as well as the clear text so

272
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,880
this will allow us to

273
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,000
decrypt messages that are sent to us

274
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,320
by using this and that's it those are

275
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,839
the only two

276
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,720
files that are in the overall process

277
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,639
although there's a few other images here

278
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,320
the rest of this stuff will give you

279
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,680
hints and tips

280
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,120
scrolling down will tell you that

281
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,760
there's only those two files as well

282
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
and we're done nothing else to see

283
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
thanks

284
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,639
32 41 5 32
