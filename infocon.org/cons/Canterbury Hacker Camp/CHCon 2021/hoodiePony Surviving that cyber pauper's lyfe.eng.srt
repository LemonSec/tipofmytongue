1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,240
good morning church on

2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,800
hope you're all adequately caffeinated

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,200
welcome to day two

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,960
wait um sorry is this is the mic on can

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,760
can you all hear me

6
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,039
this is um recorded as it's a bit too

7
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,920
early for me to do this live but

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
i'm here on discord uh just come say hi

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,280
i'm really sorry i couldn't be with you

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,399
i'm kind of stuck in melbourne australia

11
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,840
but hey

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,719
let's get on with it

13
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,560
so hello friend

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
in meat space i'm designated as then

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
many years ago

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,200
running a small business online

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,920
i experienced the fragility of my online

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,600
business

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,040
by experiencing a data breach hey

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
and that started me on a journey to

21
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,400
learn how to well secure the business

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,240
almost a decade later

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
dylan knew

24
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,880
this seems to be no easier

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,920
but like for many 2020 and 2021 prompted

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,479
a lot of reflection

27
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,240
as we collectively face this

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,439
unprecedented crisis

29
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,040
this talk was born

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
from a bit of that

31
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
reflection and to share some of the

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,600
thoughts that that has been kind of like

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,920
throwing in my head around

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,600
the cyber pains um and

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,040
that small businesses have been facing

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,320
so here goes

37
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,759
oh and if you're i know it's early but

38
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,840
if you're taking a shot

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,879
with every mention of the word cyber

40
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,840
you might want to get a new bottle ready

41
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,280
so

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
let's crack on

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,160
as cyber attacks become literal barbecue

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,480
stoppers in the last year or so

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,879
we need better cyber security

46
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,959
the need for better cyber security has

47
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,000
never

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,519
been more clear

49
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,400
as cyber is literally

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,280
integral to our lives

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,840
and all of these issues

52
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
are just the ransomware bits

53
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,680
we agreed

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
we agree that everyone needs to do cyber

55
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,360
security better

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,760
100

57
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
but i'd also like to believe that it's

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,239
fair to say that for 99 of organizations

59
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,519
and workers

60
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,440
cyber security is not the job nor

61
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,079
expertise

62
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,519
like most of us

63
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
we go to the doctor for medical help

64
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
how many times have we heard the

65
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,840
following

66
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,800
must

67
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
have more cyber awareness training

68
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
higher more cyber people spend more on

69
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,159
cyber

70
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,360
or just mandate and demand more cyber

71
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,360
security

72
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,159
problem solved

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,000
yeah

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,799
so

75
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,799
what would it cost

76
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,360
well an oversimplified look at

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,000
what is involved in do security better

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,799
or the typical business operator

79
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
we would probably need advisory services

80
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,200
to

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,280
guide us on what options we have

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
and what we should do

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
assurance services to benchmark and tell

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,319
us

85
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,599
what we really should be concerned about

86
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,480
then

87
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,159
the engineering to put all those

88
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,840
recommendations into place and then run

89
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,079
that if things go wrong

90
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,918
we'll need help to investigate what went

91
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,918
wrong and recover

92
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,240
get all of that back put us back on our

93
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,440
feet

94
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,800
we also need to make sure that

95
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
everything is done well and right

96
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,360
a good plan place and manage all of that

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,000
that's a lot

98
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
let's take a look at the first step

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,840
getting

100
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,560
advice to get started

101
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,720
we all know that blindly self-medicating

102
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,840
can sometimes be harmful so

103
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,880
let us seek some help

104
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
how much would that cost

105
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,360
let's pin that

106
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
we'll come back to it in a

107
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,280
so why are we talking more business here

108
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,639
it's because they represent the

109
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,199
overwhelming majority of business

110
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
and

111
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,440
and it's critical to our economy and

112
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
community

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
yet we often hear how unprepared small

114
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,199
businesses are for cyber attacks

115
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,960
to do that

116
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
let's first take a look at what a

117
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,039
typical small business

118
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,880
following the definition

119
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
of what a small business is according to

120
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,960
the australian tax office it is a

121
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
business with turnover of under 10

122
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,840
million

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
yes

124
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,479
and

125
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,720
those that typically they are employing

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
under 20 employees

127
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
and

128
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,479
makes an average net profit of

129
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,319
twenty to thirty thousand dollars per

130
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,560
year

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
taking further from another small

132
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,160
business study

133
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,639
it was found that an average of 275

134
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,600
dollars per full-time staff a year

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,680
is the budget for security

136
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,639
why not more

137
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,840
often

138
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,560
the decision is between paying salaries

139
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,039
to put food on the table

140
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,120
and a staff member or spending on cyber

141
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
security

142
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,400
but

143
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,039
hunger speaks volumes

144
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,240
though cyber security threats say pretty

145
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,880
top of mind

146
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
if this constraint in mind

147
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
back to that earlier question

148
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,039
how much would advice cost

149
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
well based on various chats with friends

150
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
i'm carrying rates from around 900 to

151
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,960
3000 australia a day

152
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,440
varying from boutiques to

153
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,680
big multinationals

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,039
now

155
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,319
or some of the consultants watching this

156
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,479
how many days of effort would we want to

157
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,440
give

158
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,039
info and specific advice

159
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
one day three days

160
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,280
or

161
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,000
how much in total would that cost

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
what is the minimum contract value that

163
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
the consultancy that you work for would

164
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,000
even consider

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,479
accepting

166
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,039
i've heard some consultancies

167
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,440
and seen some of them where

168
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
there is an expectation of upwards of

169
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,199
ten thousand dollars minimum contract

170
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,840
value

171
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,599
how does that make sense for small

172
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,000
business

173
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,479
perhaps guess there may be some of you

174
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,800
listening to this that have volunteered

175
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,639
to help out pro bono a few small

176
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,280
businesses that have unfortunately

177
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,080
fallen victim to cyber attacks

178
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,360
due to

179
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
our unaffordable

180
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,198
professional health terms can

181
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,639
that brings us to the cyber poverty

182
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,720
line at which an otherwise sustainable

183
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,840
organization unable to afford

184
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
access to adequate cybersecurity

185
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,800
healthcare necessities will reach a

186
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
defined minimum

187
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,639
ended

188
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,720
this sounds very much like the

189
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,279
challenges that we've just talked about

190
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,559
that small business is facing

191
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,479
this was very much inspired by an

192
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,120
interview in the riscus risky business

193
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,159
podcast

194
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,360
here

195
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
and talks by andy nades

196
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,160
like how in australia new zealand

197
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
we as society has come to agree that

198
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,640
seeing a general practitioner for

199
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,680
healthcare didn't bankrupt you

200
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,839
and we expect the same of our cyberspace

201
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,880
but why does the cyber poverty line even

202
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,959
matter

203
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,720
in the last 18 months

204
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
we have never been more dependent on our

205
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,519
connectivity cyberspace

206
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,519
from telecommunicating to work

207
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,279
to ordering groceries online during the

208
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,959
lockdown

209
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,560
do vaccine passports in an app

210
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
twice for organizations

211
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,080
many had to rapidly transition online

212
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,720
to survive

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,880
especially during the various lockdown

214
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,880
cyber security is no longer just a fun

215
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
greenfield playground

216
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,519
but

217
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
have now become

218
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,560
the underpinning of our very life

219
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,440
as cyberspace is the environment on

220
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,160
which we depend on to work

221
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
live in

222
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,200
we can learn so much more from the

223
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,600
parallels that we find in

224
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,480
health and safety

225
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,560
so

226
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
doing that learning from the coffee 90

227
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,160
crisis

228
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,079
video been told that

229
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,399
i should be getting advisory from

230
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,800
professionals specific guidance for my

231
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,399
unix equation

232
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,640
keep isolated to help limit the spread

233
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,680
and protect those who are

234
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,000
more vulnerable

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,680
perform testing so that we understand

236
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,839
where the virus is at

237
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,480
and that you have a benchmark

238
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
know whether you're infected

239
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
we rely on good engineering to develop a

240
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,480
vaccine an incident response to help

241
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
manage the whole situation

242
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
and chart a path out of it

243
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,000
the track management overarching it all

244
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,519
make sure that

245
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,800
it is a

246
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,079
proportional bonus

247
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,560
and that everyone is well informed and

248
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
communicate

249
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,279
and away

250
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
but as a

251
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
we have also come to understand that a

252
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,120
healthy society is critical to a product

253
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
with the parallel consequences we see

254
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,920
from copied 19

255
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,360
doing nothing

256
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,079
it's not really

257
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,040
what can small business afford

258
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,320
earlier

259
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,120
we know the typical profits from a

260
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
small business makes

261
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,560
we know the typical profits of a small

262
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,959
business and what they make per year

263
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,680
that's about 20 to 30

264
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
we say we consume all of that that's our

265
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,839
play

266
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,519
isn't a lot if we use the amount

267
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
budgeted by hit count we are looking at

268
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,560
about fifty five hundred dollars

269
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,760
when it starts that's about five

270
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,360
consolidates therefore

271
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,959
that's rough

272
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,720
and we're only talking about advisory

273
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
here like you know going to see your gp

274
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,959
to get advice on what to do next

275
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,279
we need to do better

276
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,399
but

277
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
hope is not all loss

278
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
for small businesses

279
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,839
are we totally screwed

280
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,079
no

281
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,680
no we are not

282
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,839
despite the adversity

283
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,560
we can do relatively well

284
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,360
by

285
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,880
taking small smart steps

286
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
one of them

287
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,720
is making smart technology choices

288
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
and to stand on the shoulders of giants

289
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,920
how powerful is this

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,800
in a previous role in security out of

291
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,240
the hundreds of

292
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,680
small business customers that we

293
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
monitored

294
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,240
only two

295
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,279
were vulnerable with this

296
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,360
surprisingly small numbers despite

297
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,040
expectations and

298
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,839
various commentaries out there

299
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,040
why

300
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,519
well we found that most

301
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,680
were running says email solutions such

302
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,279
as google workspace and microsoft 365

303
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
which

304
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,040
was not affected

305
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,079
that's kept them safe

306
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,519
let's shift the odd

307
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,920
favor

308
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,160
with three simple survival tips

309
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,639
smart choice of technology

310
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,959
good cyber hygiene

311
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,760
and

312
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,600
well when things go wrong

313
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
have an incident response plan

314
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,560
select an email provider with

315
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,120
secure defaults such as google workspace

316
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,680
or fast mail and use platforms which

317
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
have and continue to invest in security

318
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,839
more than you can as a small business

319
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,399
tools such as xero for accounting and

320
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
shopify for your ecommerce store

321
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,760
name a few examples

322
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
this will give you a solid base

323
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,120
to start with

324
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,279
but every service provider always just

325
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
say always say is that well

326
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,000
we take your security seriously

327
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,040
but do they really

328
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,560
google just released a

329
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,399
toolkit and checklist called the minimum

330
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,040
viable security product at msvp.dev

331
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,959
go through them ask your vendor those

332
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,199
questions and then let your

333
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,719
meter judge the response

334
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,079
it's a good start

335
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,920
take a look at the questions

336
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,680
it covers some of the topics that we

337
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,440
already talked about here

338
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,880
and

339
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
some of the other talks that has already

340
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,680
happened

341
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,839
at gerkon

342
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,880
like we're used to with covet 90 s aging

343
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,120
has four simple things that we can do to

344
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
keep good cyber hygiene

345
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,920
good manager

346
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,959
and use unique passwords for all sites

347
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,399
easier to remember

348
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,560
one strong password than multiple

349
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,800
different ones for each separate count

350
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,680
like

351
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
reusing tissues after you've sneezed

352
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,800
into it did it get unclean likewise

353
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,000
reusing passwords are

354
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
multi-factor authentication

355
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,959
enable then on all the things that you

356
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,320
can

357
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,639
so that if your passwords are lost or

358
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,480
stolen to a second layer of defense like

359
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,800
wearing masks a mask to protect yourself

360
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
from coving

361
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,680
even though you've been double waxed

362
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,519
possible

363
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,360
keep your software up to date

364
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
leave auto update on on your phones and

365
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
computers and all the other softwares

366
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,399
that you may have

367
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,320
like technique and vaccination for your

368
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
software keeping it continuously

369
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
protected

370
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,839
have a backup plan because

371
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,480
accidents do happen with your data

372
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,560
get a service like backplates to backup

373
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,399
your computer's data

374
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,240
it's like being able to reload a safe

375
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,519
beam for your data and critical systems

376
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,720
that covers the little things that we

377
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
can do to practice with hygiene

378
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
unfortunately

379
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,160
disasters do happen

380
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
good preparedness means

381
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,240
food

382
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,560
it means safety

383
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,880
likewise we need to be prepared inside

384
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,040
us

385
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,360
have a plan written up

386
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,759
print it out because

387
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,279
and print it out because you may not

388
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,160
have access to your technology

389
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,399
it should contain details such as who's

390
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,079
in charge

391
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,399
making all the decisions

392
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,120
and

393
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,720
make sure that they're empowered to do

394
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
so

395
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,799
a list of who to call for help

396
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,880
and who needs to know

397
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,799
this may include contacting your id

398
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,119
service provider

399
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,039
and your cyber insurance provider as

400
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,359
they may have established relationships

401
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,480
and resources

402
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,119
that may help you out

403
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,280
also your local computer emergency

404
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,559
response team

405
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,599
such as cert nz and acsc are a brilliant

406
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,079
resource

407
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
put down their contact details

408
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
so that you can make sure you are able

409
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,520
to reach them

410
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,799
then

411
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,720
write the steps you need to take down in

412
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,160
an action plan

413
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
so that you can just follow that

414
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,039
as

415
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,200
trying to figure out what to do

416
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,360
in a crisis can be more than a bit

417
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,918
challenging

418
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,240
some of these steps should include

419
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,000
calling your bank your internet service

420
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
provider your mobile phone provider to

421
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,919
make sure they take steps to help you

422
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,120
secure your accounts

423
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,320
often in such plans

424
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,000
include steps

425
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,080
needing to communicate the incident and

426
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,600
things that are happening

427
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
and actions people should take with

428
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,280
staff

429
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,400
customers

430
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,720
and stakeholders

431
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,640
find out what your obligations are under

432
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,919
any mandatory breach notification laws

433
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,480
and prepare all of these ahead of time

434
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,160
so that they are ready to send and you

435
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,840
have covered all that you need to save

436
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,039
hopefully these

437
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,360
three survival simple survival tips will

438
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,600
help shift the odds in your favor

439
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,760
or attempting to survive

440
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,919
well below the cyber poverty line

441
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,240
there's one more thing that you can do

442
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
let the good samaritans

443
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,840
there help

444
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,960
hackers

445
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,880
that would like to help you be more

446
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,320

supporters and welcome us with open arms

448
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,960
and do so

449
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,960
by making that known to us

450
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
by having a responsible disclosure

451
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,360
policy go to policymaker.disclose.io

452
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,320
it started up there

453
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,840
hopefully this tips will give small

454
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,840
businesses a fighting

455
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,120
chance but

456
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,840
the problem persists

457
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,640
and

458
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,760
not

459
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,880
a substitute for all the cybers

460
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,080
there's a lot you need to do

461
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,919
if you're a technology product small

462
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:38,880
business

463
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,400
you should definitely check out jeremy

464
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
scott's talk from yesterday

465
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,440
really good off with lots of things that

466
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,160
would help you there

467
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,760
how can small business bought

468
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
we get good cyber safety outcomes

469
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,919
get a full package

470
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,840
well we've already seen how much they

471
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,159
cost

472
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,480
especially with the current cost of

473
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,280
participation

474
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,080
i don't have a solution

475
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,678
still trying to figure that one out

476
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,000
but what i do know

477
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
is that

478
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
if our experience with covet 19 is

479
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,200
anything to go by

480
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,799
doing nothing

481
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,679
that's not an option

482
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,400
with over 90 percent of small businesses

483
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
being small but being of businesses

484
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,880
being small business

485
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,520
in a landscape where cyberspace is

486
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,720
becoming more hazardous with the excess

487
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,120
with the cost of excess

488
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,200
health growing

489
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,280
what would we want our futures to be

490
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
like

491
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,520
practice

492
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,240
and do better

493
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,320
what can we

494
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,720
collectively do to tackle

495
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,880
medical cyber poverty

496
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
what can we do more sustainably beyond

497
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,720
the ones of reconsulting that we often

498
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,280
fall back to

499
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,760
let us hack ourselves

500
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,039
more hybrid resilient community

501
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,840
a kind of future

502
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,600
thank you for indulging in my rent

503
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
questions

504
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
on the chat and work on this together

505
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,039
reach out

506
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,840
