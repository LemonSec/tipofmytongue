1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,920
hi

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,320
so as i've already admitted this talk

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
has nothing to do with being a jedi

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,719
so a more accurate title would probably

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,920
be

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,920
the psychology of social engineering

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,600
i want to start with a little bit of a

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,680
disclaimer so the things that we talk

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,519
about today aren't magically going to

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,760
get you into hacking humans and on the

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
flip side just because someone seems to

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,760
be using them against you

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,039
doesn't mean that they're manipulating

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,159
you

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,280
identifying when you're being

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,680
manipulated or co-host is something else

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,719
entirely

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,840
because

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
if it's actually done right you

20
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,239
shouldn't even realize that it's

21
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,320
happening

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,760
and one final point that i wanted to

23
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,399
make

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,200
was

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,960
as i was putting this talk together i

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,480
started wondering if people are going to

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
think that i use these techniques on

28
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,160
them in everyday life

29
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,480
and the truth is yes

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,760
so a lot of the techniques are quite

31
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,120
basic and they're just part of my

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,199
socialising tool set and i imagine that

33
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:00,640
a lot of people in this room will use

34
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,120
them as well

35
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,159
so let's go over a little bit about me

36
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,479
so as tony said my name is fiona

37
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,880
i really like huskies so we just

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,640
recently got our fourth one he's an

39
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,159
eight month old

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,600
and if you want to see some photos of

41
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
him you can always come and see me later

42
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,520
but he's 28 kgs of pure fluff and

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,080
destruction

44
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,560
i'm also a people person

45
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
so i was listening to this podcast at

46
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,080
the start of the year and they were

47
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,439
talking about the two different types of

48
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
security personalities so you've got the

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,960
computer hackers and then you've got the

50
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,520
people hackers

51
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
i have met these unicorns that do fall

52
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
into both of these categories and these

53
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,159
people are the ones you want to watch

54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,520
out for

55
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
but i'm pretty confident that i fall

56
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,240
into this people hacking category

57
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,720
so i studied psychology at uni

58
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,799
which as tony said was a completely

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,640
useless degree but i did somehow managed

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,560
to score a job as a test analyst from it

61
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,240
and now before we actually launch into a

62
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,479
manipulation presentation

63
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,079
i wanted to start with some fun facts

64
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,600
you know to get those brain juices

65
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
flowing

66
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,120
so several studies have shown that

67
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
looking at cute images including baby

68
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,120
animals will actually improve focus and

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
concentration

70
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
so i just want to take a moment to just

71
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,840
soak in how adorable the sloth is

72
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
empower stances

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
actually help to reduce fear

74
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
so that can lead you to feeling more

75
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,599
open and relaxed during public speaking

76
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
another one your tallest in the morning

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,120
so across the day gravity literally

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
pulls you down by compressing the

79
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,080
cartilage in your bones which makes you

80
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,480
shorter

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
and body language

82
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
body language provides a crucial aspect

83
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
for getting people to like you

84
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
and liking you extends to doing things

85
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
for you so i guess the manipulation side

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,120
of things and that happens to be why

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,800
we're here today

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
the techniques that we talk about today

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,120
will hopefully get people to like you

90
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,040
and to establish trust

91
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
which will then enable you to get people

92
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,280
to do things that they normally wouldn't

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
i've broken this talk up into three

94
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,879
parts

95
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,840
the first part is body

96
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,959
language we're going to spend a lot more

97
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,879
time talking about body language because

98
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,560
it's what builds the foundations to help

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
you establish trust and rapport

100
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,799
and for those of you who haven't seen it

101
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,680
yet the push by darren brown is an

102
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
amazing documentary and i just can't

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,080
rate it enough

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,599
so it proves how easy it is to

105
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,200
manipulate someone once you have their

106
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,560
trust

107
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
i don't want to spoil it for anyone who

108
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,519
hasn't seen it yet

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,319
but maybe it involves a baby kidnapping

110
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,399
a dead body and a potential motor

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
okay so enough procrastinating let's get

112
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,159
into body language

113
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,720
body language is complex so it can be

114
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,400
defined a lot more granular than these

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
three components if you've seen the tv

116
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
show lie to me you'll understand how

117
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,360
complex body language can be

118
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,280
but micro expressions are a lot more

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,920
complex than i want to talk about today

120
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
because we're starting with body

121
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
language 101

122
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,480
for a lot of people

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
there are things these are things that

124
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
will come naturally for them without any

125
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,519
thought so i do apologize because it

126
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,839
will seem very basic

127
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,360
but i do think it's important to talk

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
about posture

129
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,440
eye contact and personal space because

130
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,960
these three things are often done

131
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,600
incorrectly and will negatively affect

132
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
your ability to foster trust

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,199
so looking at posture

134
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
this is referring to the non-verbal cues

135
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,199
that come from a way a person's standing

136
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,800
or positioning their body when they're

137
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,560
having a conversation or maybe before

138
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
you've even approached them

139
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,160
so posture can exist in two different

140
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,280
states

141
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,759
closed and open

142
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,600
closed state typically aims to protect

143
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,160
your key body parts so your throat your

144
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,960
abdomen your genitals

145
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,520
so that comes across as hunching

146
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,600
crossing your shoulders if you're

147
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,759
sitting crossing your legs maybe

148
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,800
clutching a bag to your chest

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,440
open posture does the opposite so all

150
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,080
your vulnerable areas are exposed your

151
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,400
head is raised your shoulders are back

152
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,039
your bag is by your side

153
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,199
your body is defenseless against an

154
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,120
attack because your body is literally

155
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,560
saying that you trust this person

156
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,440
so what does this posture look like

157
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,919
you're probably thinking subject a looks

158
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,039
bored

159
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,160
tired

160
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,600
uninterested

161
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,440
maybe defeated

162
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,199
subject a probably isn't listening to

163
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
what you're saying and they're just

164
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,320
likely just waiting for you to finish

165
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,520
okay what about subject b

166
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,960
so there's a lot of answers that you can

167
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,600
have for this but most likely subject b

168
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,800
is feeling angry and irritated

169
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
some of the things that you probably

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,360
didn't notice

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,280
was that his body direction is facing

172
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
slightly away from you

173
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,520
he's literally not prioritizing you with

174
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,680
his body language so basically he is

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
done with this conversation

176
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,919
his arms being crossed implies that he

177
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,319
is closed off and defensive

178
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,680
if we actually looked at him for too

179
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
long we would end up feeling more

180
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,759
irritable and frustrated

181
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,120
and i will get into the science of why

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
that is later

183
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,479
but how would you react if you are

184
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,240
having a one-on-one conversation with

185
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,639
either of these people

186
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
for subject a you would likely want to

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,080
finish talking as quickly as possible

188
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
and you'll probably leave feeling a

189
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,080
little bit dejected and down mirroring

190
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
her mood and her reactions

191
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,880
for subject b you would likely feel a

192
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
lot more defensive

193
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,680
so it's a natural and a natural instinct

194
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
to want to protect yourself against

195
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,400
someone who is coming across as

196
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,639
aggressive

197
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,039
you would finish feeling more irritated

198
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,599
by his mood

199
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,360
but which one of them is more likely to

200
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
help you do something

201
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,520
so purely from looking at these two

202
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,800
images

203
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,080
i don't think either of them are going

204
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,440
to help you

205
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,039
but that's based on their current body

206
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,800
language and not what they're actually

207
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,919
feeling

208
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,840
and that's

209
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
because we read body language based on

210
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,280
what we see

211
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,400
and not what the other person is feeling

212
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
so this translates to how people

213
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,199
interpret you if you're smiling

214
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,520
facing them standing upright they're

215
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,720
more likely to like you to listen to you

216
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
and help you

217
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
and it actually means that the longer

218
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,759
you look at someone who's showing

219
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,120
disgust

220
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,759
the more uncomfortable you'll feel

221
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,840
if you look at someone who is smiling

222
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,160
the happier you'll feel

223
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,759
so there are two chemical reactions that

224
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,599
are going on in the brain with this

225
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,120
one of them is dopamine and that

226
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
controls your emotional response

227
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,360
so it's often associated with happiness

228
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
the more dopamine that is released the

229
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,360
happier that you'll be

230
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,759
and the other one is oxytocin

231
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,840
so you release more oxytocin when you

232
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,160
trust someone or when you're made to

233
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,639
believe that you trust them

234
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
if you look at someone who is more

235
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,000
trustworthy so smiling relaxed open

236
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,840
you'll have a better chance of liking

237
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,080
them

238
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,759
so in terms of body language

239
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,120
this is the sort of conversation that

240
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,879
we're aiming for

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,800
and for all the smart alex's in the

242
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
audience the goal is not to turn into

243
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,880
two businessmen in suits

244
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,719
it's to show that you're listening

245
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,399
as to show you're engaged and you're a

246
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,320
part of the conversation

247
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,479
so slightly lean in towards them

248
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,880
look at them

249
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,919
it's just

250
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
sorry

251
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,959
even direct your feet in their direction

252
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880
if if your feet are pointed away from

253
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
them you're literally telling them that

254
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,959
you are ready to walk away

255
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,200
keep an open posture and try to avoid

256
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,120
using negative expressions

257
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
like disappointment which will show in

258
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
your mouth when the corners of your

259
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,839
mouth turns down

260
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,240
or frustration which always shows more

261
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,519
in your brows when they kind of

262
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,240
scrunched together

263
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,399
and not everyone is a smiler but it

264
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,320
would help your situation to smile at

265
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
least slightly

266
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,279
but you do need to extend the smile to

267
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,440
your eyes because if it comes across as

268
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
unnatural it will come across as creepy

269
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,880
so that's all i wanted to discuss for

270
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
posture today the main message was that

271
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,640
you need to make yourself as least

272
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
threatening as possible

273
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
and if you can do that the person you're

274
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,839
talking to will

275
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,279
begin to reflect your relaxed demeanor

276
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,880
so now it's time to look at eye contact

277
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,519
as someone said the eyes are the gateway

278
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,080
to the soul

279
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
and if you want to build a relationship

280
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
with someone

281
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
eye contact is one of the fastest ways

282
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,399
to do this

283
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,320
it shows that you are listening

284
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
and it helps them you to read and

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
reflect their reactions

286
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
if you maintain eye contact the result

287
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,839
is you will feel and appear more

288
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,839
confident

289
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
it can be important

290
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,880
if you are somewhere that you're not

291
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,959
supposed to be so say the restricted

292
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,240
area of a building that you've just

293
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,399
walked into

294
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,240
and if you're bad at eye contact people

295
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
will assume that you're insecure

296
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,360
bored and not concentrating or that you

297
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
lack self-confidence

298
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,720
but do be careful

299
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,560
about holding eye contact too intently

300
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
so if you're not good at eye contact

301
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,720
here are some helpful tips

302
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
try focusing on the spot between the

303
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,240
eyes for one to two seconds

304
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,079
try not to maintain eye contact for four

305
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:43,839
to five for longer than four to five

306
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,440
seconds so if you feel like you're

307
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
getting to that point blink look to the

308
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,040
side and then look back at them

309
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
eye contact is a lot

310
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,640
a lot easier and it'll come a lot

311
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,800
naturally more naturally when you're

312
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,000
looking at someone and when you're

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,839
listening to them

314
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,600
but it will be a lot harder when you're

315
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,200
speaking and that's totally fine

316
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,399
okay so that was eye contact

317
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,000
it's an easy concept but it is a lot

318
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
harder to follow through with

319
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
so the last lesson that i wanted to go

320
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
through for body language was personal

321
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
space

322
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,800
so personal space is a big one

323
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,880
and research actually suggests that this

324
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,519
is typically 1.2 metres away from

325
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
someone so i have been carrying around

326
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
this pool noodle all day to demonstrate

327
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,279
exactly how far away that is

328
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,240
so for me as someone who actually likes

329
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,880
personal space that seems like so far

330
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
away

331
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
but everyone is different and you need

332
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,640
to respect that

333
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,519
for anyone that you don't know well just

334
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,920
give a bit more personal space too

335
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
the upside of this is that you'll reduce

336
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,639
the risk of catching covert

337
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,360
you won't be able to smell their breath

338
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,040
and if you're erratic with your hand

339
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,199
gestures you're less likely to hit them

340
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,320
well personal space is important

341
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,920
most people do actually communicate

342
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,000
using touch

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,160
not convinced well when you greet

344
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
someone for the first time

345
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,240
what is the first thing that you do

346
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,720
you give them a handshake

347
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
a handshake can tell you a lot about a

348
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,360
person

349
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
and it can make or break that first

350
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,079
impression

351
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,079
too firm of a handshake and you'll come

352
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,279
across as controlling or neurotic it may

353
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,200
even appear that you're overcompensating

354
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,240
for something

355
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,040
and can't be trusted

356
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,399
and there's nothing worse than one of

357
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,800
those weak floppy handshakes that make a

358
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,519
person come across as insecure and

359
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,920
nervous

360
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,000
because of covert i can't get you to

361
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
practice today but there are a lot of

362
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,440
ways that you can go wrong with a

363
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,639
handshake

364
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,639
and a bad handshake can negatively

365
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,800
impact your chances of establishing

366
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
trust

367
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,519
come and see me afterwards if you're

368
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,760
after some pointers

369
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,240
but going back to personal space

370
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
i can't tell you one golden fast rule

371
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,800
that is going to work for everyone

372
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,399
but you do have to be mindful of the

373
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,160
message that you are sending when you

374
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,480
enter someone's personal space

375
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
if you step closer to them

376
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,399
and they step back

377
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,360
register that their body language is

378
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,880
telling you something

379
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,200
and being able to successfully

380
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,040
understand that will improve your

381
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,480
interactions with people

382
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
so how do you tell if you're too close

383
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,160
so it's not the same for everyone but i

384
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,079
can definitely say if you are able to

385
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,320
see the blackheads on their nose

386
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
time to take a step back

387
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
but seriously what is their body

388
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
language saying

389
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,399
are they leaning into you

390
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,839
are they

391
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,600
nodding are they engaging with what

392
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
you're saying

393
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,199
if they are it probably means that

394
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,720
you're at a good distance

395
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,560
and actually congratulations i think

396
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,120
you're building good rapport

397
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,000
or are they speaking in short bursts are

398
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,839
they looking away a lot are they

399
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,480
stepping back

400
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,440
try to make them feel comfortable so

401
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,360
just give them a bit of space

402
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,279
ensure that your body language isn't

403
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,959
threatening to them

404
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,880
so if they are sitting down

405
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,920
take yourself down to their their level

406
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,720
so that you're not towering over them

407
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,480
but mostly and i cannot stress this

408
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
enough just pay attention to their body

409
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,240
language and if they look like they need

410
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,279
space

411
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
give it to them

412
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,680
okay so that concludes body language 101

413
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,000
we've covered the importance of posture

414
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,399
eye contact and personal space

415
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
and congratulations you are now a body

416
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,720
language novice

417
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,480
but it's time to move on to building

418
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,279
rapport with someone

419
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,440
so what is rapport

420
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519
i was going to read out a dif

421
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,519
dictionary definition but honestly it's

422
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,440
just really the friendly relationship

423
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,600
that you feel with someone

424
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,440
so that might be with your co-worker the

425
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,839
barista at your favorite coffee shop or

426
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,480
maybe even your latest candidate

427
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,800
to be honest the reason for this phase

428
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
is all about building trust

429
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
there's no algorithm for this

430
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
but there are a few techniques that you

431
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
can use in a conversation that will help

432
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,560
sway things in your favor

433
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,800
active listening

434
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,040
so active listening is a key concept for

435
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
communicating and building rapport

436
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,000
if someone is speaking with you

437
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,680
listen to them

438
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,199
it sounds easy

439
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,880
because it is

440
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,720
if someone is speaking with you

441
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,399
face them

442
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,720
with your whole body

443
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
show them with your body language that

444
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,959
you're engaged

445
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,399
look at them

446
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,880
use eye contact

447
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,240
not along with the things that you agree

448
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
with shake your head if you disagree

449
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,360
with them

450
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,839
add constructive comments

451
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
or ask relevant questions

452
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,600
active listening isn't just nodding and

453
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,759
throwing in the occasional yes

454
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,360
it's about as being as much a part of

455
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,639
the conversation

456
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,800
as the person telling it

457
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,560
so i like to think of this as the

458
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
difference between being talked to and

459
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,079
being spoken with

460
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,199
so one of them you're part of the

461
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,959
conversation and the other one you're

462
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,560
just standing there

463
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,000
and funnily enough it is much more

464
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,839
enjoyable to be part of the conversation

465
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,399
so i do want to bring up one of those

466
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,160
hormones that i mentioned earlier

467
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,519
dopamine

468
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,519
so human contact actually triggers

469
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,440
dopamine production and so sometimes

470
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,920
that can mean a handshake or a hug

471
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,199
but it can also be something

472
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,560
non-physical

473
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
like eye contact or a smile

474
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,320
the more dopamine that is released the

475
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,399
happier you will be

476
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,000
and studies have been done to show that

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
these active listening techniques will

478
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,800
help with the production of dopamine

479
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,440
which can make them feel happier

480
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,600
and more relaxed

481
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
being more relaxed and less stress

482
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,600
actually helps you get closer to

483
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,120
establishing that feeling of trust

484
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,679
okay so now that you've engaged in this

485
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,599
story or discussion

486
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,760
it's time for a story of your own

487
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,240
try sharing an anecdote

488
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,959
and the reason of this is to bond to

489
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,439
make yourself more relatable

490
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,959
it's to make things just that a little

491
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,199
bit more personal

492
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,199
so i personally like to use anecdotes to

493
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,799
show that i'm human and that i make

494
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,039
mistakes which is all of the time and

495
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,400
an anecdote

496
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,480
isn't about telling them the chronicles

497
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,080
of your childhood right from your

498
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,799
earliest memory to the last time you wet

499
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,000
the bed

500
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,520
it's got to be short and sweet

501
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,160
relevance is also key here

502
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,679
so if they're talking about their love

503
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,679
of dessert

504
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,000
maybe you could think about or tell them

505
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,320
the time that you tried to make cookies

506
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,000
and you accidentally added salt instead

507
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,360
of sugar

508
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,120
or maybe it was the time that you

509
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,640
discovered your love of creme brulee

510
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,799
you could lie at this point

511
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,120
but the best lies do have foundations of

512
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,000
truth

513
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,280
and if you're already aiming to

514
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,360
manipulate them it's probably better to

515
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,400
come across

516
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,799
more real and natural

517
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,880
it also can't be too random

518
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
and it is important for it to be

519
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,000
appropriate to the tone

520
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,240
so if you're at a funeral it's not

521
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,080
appropriate to tell that funny exploding

522
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,559
poo story that you have

523
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,160
or on the flip side

524
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,520
if you're meeting someone for the first

525
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,799
time

526
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,160
don't tell them about your roadkill

527
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,200
taxidermy collection

528
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
so at this point we're establishing a

529
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
connection and the focus is on making

530
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
this as positive and exchange as

531
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,000
possible

532
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,880
so the next step is about exploiting

533
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,559
that growing connection

534
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,080
this is the step where you can look at

535
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
them and you can think

536
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,280
i've got you so this isn't about you

537
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,440
copying them but it's about getting them

538
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,679
to copy you

539
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,440
so well you could ask someone to copy

540
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,559
you

541
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,720
we need them to do it subconsciously

542
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,799
so we need them in a state where they

543
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,120
don't even know that they are doing it

544
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,559
and to help you understand how that's

545
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,400
even possible we're going to have to

546
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,039
look at a neuron

547
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,640
so a neuron is made up of

548
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,960
a head

549
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
a body and these terminal points

550
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,480
neurons are actually what make up the

551
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
brain and they allow your brain to

552
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,600
transmit data

553
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
data or thoughts will come in through

554
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,000
the head go down the body and out the

555
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,559
axon terminal points which are then

556
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,120
connected to another neuron

557
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
the connection point between two neurons

558
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,600
are referred to as a synapse

559
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,919
a synapse allows one neuron to transmit

560
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,080
electrical or chemical information to

561
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,760
another

562
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,600
new synapses are created for new

563
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,000
information or memories

564
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,799
and old synapse pathways fire when

565
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,799
remembering something or performing a

566
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,600
learnt behaviour

567
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
to give you an idea of scale there are

568
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,879
100 billion neurons in the human brain

569
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,360
but we want to focus on a specific group

570
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,440
of them and these are referred to as

571
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
mirror neurons

572
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,679
so we can use body language to bond with

573
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
people and to build rapport

574
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,000
but in doing so we are fundamentally

575
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,440
changing the way our neurons fire

576
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
this is where mirror neurons come into

577
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,000
play

578
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,720
so mirror neurons are social neurons

579
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,480
the other neurons that kick into play

580
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,320
when you find yourself accidentally

581
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,559
mimicking someone's accent

582
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,000
and they're also involved with building

583
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,200
rapport and showing empathy

584
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,480
mirror neurons

585
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,919
are the neurons that fire when you

586
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,440
complete an action

587
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,400
or

588
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,080
when you watch someone complete an

589
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,200
action

590
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
so i'm going to repeat that part

591
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,039
the same message is being fired in your

592
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,039
brain regardless of if you're the one

593
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,559
doing the action

594
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,760
or if you're watching someone else do it

595
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,159
and that extends to intentions and

596
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,919
feelings

597
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,840
and they play a key part in our ability

598
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,799
to socialize and empathize with others

599
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,440
when we see facial expressions such as

600
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,039
sadness happiness anger worry

601
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,120
we begin to feel that emotion

602
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,720
all thanks to these wonderful moral

603
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,880
neurons

604
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,799
when we're talking with someone that we

605
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,640
get along really well with we

606
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,799
subconsciously switch our body position

607
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,480
to match the other person

608
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,240
and that's to help signal the level of

609
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,880
connection and engagement

610
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
body signals are important when

611
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,760
interpreting feelings and emotions

612
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,919
but mirror neurons help us to empathize

613
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,559
with those feelings and emotions

614
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,280
when we manipulate or we can begin to

615
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,120
manipulate this by observing the

616
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,840
behavior of those around us

617
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
and subtly letting your body reflect

618
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,600
their positioning

619
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,559
if their arms are crossed slowly cross

620
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
your arms

621
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,480
if they lean back

622
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
slowly lean back

623
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,640
match your breathing to theirs

624
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,720
mooring their body language increases

625
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,120
the feeling of bonding between you and

626
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,639
the other person in the conversation

627
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
so now you can try to shift your body

628
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
slightly

629
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,360
scratch your head

630
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,600
rub your nose

631
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,280
are they beginning to copy you back

632
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
and this comes in handy in any sort of

633
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,960
situation where a social bond may

634
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
improve your position so that could be

635
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,760
an interview a team meeting or meeting

636
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,559
the in-laws for the first time and so on

637
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,120
okay so that was building rapport

638
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,960
well a large chunk of it is to do with

639
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,720
communication

640
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,799
it does also involve aspects of body

641
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,799
language and understanding how the human

642
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,799
brain works

643
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,559
okay so it's time to move on to that

644
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
last phase of the process

645
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,440
manipulation

646
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,159
how do we know that we've established

647
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,520
trust

648
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,000
well they might be leaning into you

649
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,679
they might be beginning to imitate your

650
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,840
behavior

651
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,320
their body language is likely to be more

652
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,280
open

653
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,039
maybe they're smiling and nodding along

654
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,880
with you

655
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,039
at this point you can play the long game

656
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,200
and sow the seed of an idea

657
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
or the short game

658
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,840
either way getting some someone to do

659
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,039
something for you comes in two parts

660
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,080
so you should always start with

661
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,679
something little

662
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,679
like ask them to hold open a door for

663
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:34,640
you

664
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,480
or get them to pack up a pen

665
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,400
so what's cool is that doing you a favor

666
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,919
actually helps to build the trust that

667
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,600
they have with you and they're more

668
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,600
likely to do a bigger favor for you next

669
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,960
time

670
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
so the reverse of this doesn't actually

671
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,880
work so if you offer to do something for

672
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
them they are more likely to be more

673
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,120
guarded and unwilling and that comes

674
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,279
from an unwillingness to feel indebted

675
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,760
to someone

676
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,279
okay

677
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,799
so now that they've had a door open for

678
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,559
you

679
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,240
try asking them

680
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
if you can use their computer to send an

681
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,440
email

682
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,480
or

683
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,000
maybe they'll swipe you into a secure

684
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
area

685
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,320
or

686
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,440
maybe they'll push someone off a

687
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
building for you

688
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,760
okay so you've already graduated my mini

689
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,520
course on the fundamentals of

690
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,279
manipulation

691
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,559
but this talk wouldn't be complete

692
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,240
without without applying what we've

693
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,200
learned

694
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,840
to the real world

695
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,279
so i'm going to quickly go over one of

696
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,200
my greatest achievements as well as one

697
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,799
of my greatest disappointments that's

698
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,480
all mixed into one

699
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,960
it was the time that i accidentally

700
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
socially engineered my way into the

701
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,720
qantas lounge

702
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
so for a full disclosure i didn't start

703
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,720
out by trying to get free pancakes and

704
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,799
coffee

705
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,320
but sometimes the stars aligned and it

706
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,559
just worked out that way

707
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,640
so let me set the same

708
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,320
cast your minds back to the year 2018

709
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,120
when we're allowed to travel freely

710
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
facial mass was something that only bank

711
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,799
robbers wore

712
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,159
and no one was worried about social

713
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,000
distancing

714
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,159
so i was heading over to australia for

715
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,320
crackycon

716
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,480
and being frugal by nature i had booked

717
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,919
the cheapest flight which ended up

718
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,400
having a two-hour layover in sydney and

719
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,559
it departed at some ridiculously early

720
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,240
hour

721
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,080
so on checking in i was friendly and

722
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,240
polite with the flight attendant

723
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
and in return she gave me one of the

724
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,880
coveted emergency exit seats

725
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,559
and this set in motion the following

726
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,880
events

727
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,039
so once i boarded my flight i slept for

728
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,799
most of the journey and i only really

729
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,360
woke up for the descent into sydney

730
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,799
and that's when i ended up chatting to

731
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,960
the gentleman beside me

732
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
so we're going to call him walter

733
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,400
and it's not because i'm trying to keep

734
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,480
his identity secret i just can't

735
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,720
remember his name

736
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,159
so let's check off the points that we've

737
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,679
learned today with my interaction with

738
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,080
walter

739
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,559
posture

740
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,000
so posture is a little bit hard when

741
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,960
you're on a jetstar flight

742
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,799
but it's not impossible

743
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,200
so i swiveled my body towards him

744
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,960
and while we talked i would keep

745
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,960
periodic eye contact

746
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
so not too much because it was a

747
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
stranger but enough eye contact to at

748
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,600
least be polite

749
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,840
personal space is again a little bit

750
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
more difficult to maintain when you're

751
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,799
strapped to a seat in a confined space

752
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,320
so it's a little bit less applicable in

753
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,559
the situation but i did also make a

754
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,880
point of not being too close because as

755
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,640
i mentioned i do like my personal space

756
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,919
so i listened like i really listened

757
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,120
and i still remember a lot of the

758
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,159
conversation that we had today

759
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,919
and active listening morphs a little bit

760
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,159
into sharing anecdotes and we found

761
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,159
common ground with mountain bike racing

762
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,760
and i was able to share some stories

763
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
from the races i had done

764
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
before we knew it we were building trust

765
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,600
and without even meaning to i was

766
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,480
mimicking his behavior

767
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,720
and vice versa so small things like a

768
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,240
head scratch and a leg cross

769
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,120
by the time the plane had landed we had

770
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,039
discussed how we both had long layovers

771
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,399
in sydney

772
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,399
i had shared with him my research

773
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,679
and getting from the international

774
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,399
building to the domestic building

775
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,799
and he had helped me out by passing down

776
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,159
my back from the overhead luggage

777
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,320
compartment

778
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,559
at some point during a conversation he

779
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
mentioned about having a qantas lounge

780
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,080
membership

781
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,320
and one of the benefits of that is being

782
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,159
able to share entry with someone he's

783
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,080
traveling with

784
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,320
so initially that wasn't an invite

785
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,919
merely teaching me how to work the

786
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,080
system

787
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,480
eventually he extended the olive branch

788
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,039
and asked if i'd like to join him

789
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,039
and there we have it

790
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,120
so while i'd love to say that i targeted

791
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
him specifically with the goal in mind

792
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,440
of getting into the qantas lounge

793
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,399
i can't

794
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,640
it was an absolute fluke forever

795
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,520
remembered as the time i ended up in an

796
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,120
airline lounge on my way to a security

797
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,600
conference

798
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,679
and as i said this is also one of my

799
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,520
greatest disappointments so the

800
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,279
disappointment comes from not having the

801
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,039
foresight to get photographic evidence

802
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,640
but don't worry

803
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,120
using my impressive photoshop skills i

804
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,879
have managed to recreate the moment

805
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,919
okay so some takeaways i'm actually not

806
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,520
too worried what you choose to take away

807
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,600
from this it might be that you need to

808
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,960
remember to blink when speaking with

809
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,360
someone or it could be how impressive my

810
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,440
photoshop skills are

811
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,799
but the biggest takeaway that i would

812
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,799
like you to remember

813
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,520
is

814
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,679
be kind to others because you never know

815
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,520
when the person sitting next to you can

816
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,919
get you into an airline lounge

817
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:54,930
thanks

818
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:04,700
[Applause]

819
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,600
you
