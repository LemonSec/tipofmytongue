just chill out

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,920
this is not the typical conference talk

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,400
as you can see one we get to sit down

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
and we get a fancy uh carpet

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,680
that's nice and

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,119
it's more

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,119
all of us talking we're just happening

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,279
to lead the scenario if you want to talk

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,039
due to the lights i can't actually see

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,560
you but raise your hands and somebody

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,359
will

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,719
bring you a mic

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,559
you relate any questions or comments you

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,760
have to them and they will relate them

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,120
to the mic for the people on the live

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,120
stream or the discords

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,120
um

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,520

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
we're gonna tell you that we're not

23

and other than that i've mostly found

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,239
myself in the last couple years being a

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,400
ceo trainer coach and mentor because

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
this may surprise some of you folks ceos

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,319
don't actually know what they're doing

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,799
they're winging it at all times and most

95
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,040
of them are desperately insecure about

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,239
it now you know

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,159
um next slide so what what is mental

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,040
health um so i guess one thing that you

99
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,720
yeah we've changed our slides in the

100
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,040
last hour and the first one i i had to

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
put up there is mental health as a

102
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,680
social construct because what is

103
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
mentally healthy for somebody who is in

104
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
the wacky high pressure area of opsec

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,159
and i.t in new zealand is different from

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,599
what's mentally healthy from a rice

107
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,680
farmer in thailand i have to move here

108
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,879
from thailand

109
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
um mental health

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,480
what it is is very much situational and

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,439
what's

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,200
you know there are some things that nah

113
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,480
if you're hearing voices and they're

114
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,239
telling you to

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,799
go out and arrange all the rocks in the

116
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,238
courtyard

117
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:17,839
that's probably

118
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,798
often most cultures but not all

119
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,839
so

120
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
we are dealing with the social construct

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
of mental health as it is perceived in

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
the west

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
and as it is

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,360
certainly affected by our industry

125
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,160
because

126
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,000
our industry

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,520
is unhealthy

128
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,040
no really

129
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
there are things that happen in our

130
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
industry

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
that just would not fly in a lot of

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
places

133
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,160
and we have grown to accept that and

134
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
we've grown to normalize it

135
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
and hopefully

136
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,800
we can start to

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,199
as the kids say that up by

138
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,440
being willing to be more present and

139
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,280
talking about

140
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,120
issues around stress and issues around

141
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
mental health especially as it applies

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
to our industries

143
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
and i think one thing to

144
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,039
mention is mental health is for each

145
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,720
individual person my mental health is my

146
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
mental health your mental health is your

147
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
mental health and all of yours if you've

148
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,960
had issues or mental health

149
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,520
problems they're yours but

150
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,000
we're free to talk about it amongst each

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,960
other and

152
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,639
it's talking about mental health is

153
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,400
almost as popular with management as

154
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
talking about your salaries in public

155
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,560
yeah

156
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,160
you should be talking about both by the

157
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,120
way

158
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,400
um because

159
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,639
you get to be the living example they

160
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,080
theoretically should not fire you for

161
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,759
talking about your mental health and

162
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,080
your mental well-being or your pay or

163
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,600
how much you're getting paid and it may

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,759
be informative to other people for you

165
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,520
to be that person and be public about it

166
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,800
um

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,720
so as we mentioned at the start this is

168
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
a interactive talk so if you guys want

169
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
to well guys and girls sorry um

170
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,759
well

171
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,440
that's probably not even the most pc

172
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,080

don't be personally offended it's

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,520
because

180
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,360
we're helping to make sure that you're

181
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
staying on topic relevant to the talk

182
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,120
that we're trying to give

183
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,720
and

184
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,479
we're going to try to steer things so if

185
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,600
you're talking

186
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
a little bit too deeply

187
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,240
talk to us after we're not mental health

188
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,440
professionals but we're pretty nice

189
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,199
people and we're moderately willing to

190
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,000
listen

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,120
and i'm going to leave the video

192
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,319
immediately um

193
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,319
but yeah this is interactive so feel

194
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,560
free to throw your stuff in and what is

195
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
the next slide um i think also a bit of

196
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
background on

197
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,000
why

198
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
we're in this situation this is kind of

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,720
a

200
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
we meet up monthly ish and have coffees

201
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,400
and

202
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,280
we kind of chat about this sort of thing

203
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,919
yeah so fairly regularly and now we're

204
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,160
just inviting all of you to join our

205
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,199
conversation i guess yeah i

206
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,759
so being open about me hi

207
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,759
i'm a person with mental health issues

208
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,479
i've lost two jobs in the last 10 years

209
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,880
due to nervous breakdowns

210
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,520
that was not fun i have both chronic and

211
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,759
episodic anxiety

212
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
i take pills for the chronic anxiety

213
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,720
three times a day the episodic anxiety

214
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,680
such as

215
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,120
you know fear of getting on stage and

216
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,160
talking to 100 people

217
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,720
i took a pill just about 40 minutes ago

218
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
that's why i appear so chill i also take

219
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,400
pill before

220
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,479
salary negotiation

221
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,879
major client presentation

222
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
they're tools i have the type of anxiety

223
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,560
that will leave me a fairly gibbering

224
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,879
mess if i don't moderate it my brain

225
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,479
chemistry

226
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,879
is not the optimal brain chemistry for

227
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
the profession that i have picked or the

228
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
profession that has picked me so i have

229
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,479
to modify that brain chemistry with

230
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,440
tools

231
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,800
you know as you've seen the memes

232
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,479
somewhere and there may or may not be

233
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,840
memes coming up after the rainbows

234
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,800
um

235
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,319
if you don't make the right

236
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,560
neurochemicals that's okay store bought

237
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
is fine

238
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
now the reason for both those nervous

239
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,479
breakdowns was

240
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,039
irrational levels of stress

241
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,520
i've mostly been in the sales side in it

242
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
or the management side or the sales

243
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,679
management side things like that

244
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,159
speaker to money for engineers

245
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,679
and

246
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,039
the first one

247
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,880
um so the sales cycle in i.t

248
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,560
you don't go out and close a sale you

249
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,959
talk to people for three months six

250
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,640
months a year

251
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,519
there might be multiple proposal cycles

252
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,160
and eventually you develop a client and

253
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,839
you maintain a client relationship this

254
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,080
is very much relationship selling and

255
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,640
one afternoon i had my boss come in the

256
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,959
morning my boss came into me and said i

257
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,240
don't care what you do i need you to

258
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,000
close three hundred thousand dollars

259
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,399
today

260
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
that

261
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,519
is stressful

262
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,519
uh i'm pleased to say i did it

263
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,880
um

264
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
i'm not pleased to say how i did it i

265
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,600
went to

266
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,680
a client who'd been my client

267
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,240
he was at justice and then he was my

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,399
client at post and then he was my client

269
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,240
at other government agency that she'll

270
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,560
remain unnamed and i said hey dude um

271
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,519
do you have any of those shitty 25 000

272
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,519
jobs sitting on your desk that nobody

273
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,800
wants to do he said yeah i've got a

274
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,959
dozen of them it's like great i'll take

275
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,519
them all

276
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,560
now this particular employer is a large

277
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,959
company and i happen to know our

278
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,760
overhead on any project was 50k

279
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,440
so in taking

280
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,399
a dozen 25k project i was guaranteeing

281
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,680
loss on every single one but my boss did

282
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
not care about that he cared about the

283
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,480
clothes get him 300k so i got him 300k

284
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
and um

285
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,040
i was already an irregular employee then

286
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,279
i was grumpy i was

287
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,480
prone to inappropriate outbursts

288
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,399
i did not realize that what was

289
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,839
happening is i was having a nervous

290
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
breakdown i did not realize it when i

291
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,160
had been was getting fired

292
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,160
um

293
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,000
i didn't realize it until six months

294
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,560
later that not only had i had a nervous

295
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
breakdown but the guy that i replaced in

296
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,000
that role had a nervous breakdown too

297
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,440
and the only thing he and i had in

298
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
common was one boss

299
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,560
and one boss can really things up

300
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,360
if they don't know what they're doing

301
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,279
if you are in a management role here

302
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,279
feel free to ask management oriented

303
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
questions on how to

304
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,880
deal with things because that is a topic

305
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,640
that's not get addressed sufficiently

306
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,839
either

307
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,320
so that's a little bit about me and my

308
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,720
background and why i thought this talk

309
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,440
was important because also

310
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,959
i don't work at a big company anymore

311
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,480
and i don't give a when anybody

312
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,000
thinks

313
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,440
fair enough

314
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,279
um

315
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,279
yeah it's

316
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,720
good to kind of

317
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
think more about mental health and talk

318
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
about it and

319
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
there's a lot of kind of misinformation

320
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,720
out there because people seem to think

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
as from this slide uh

322
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
anybody here heard of miss or

323
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
disinformation before

324
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,440
nobody

325
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,240
um uh turns out daniel and i hear uh

326
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,880
sinners because we have mental

327
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,600
issues and yeah

328
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,680
there's an asterisk there

329
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,079
this is

330
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,720
we are not by our values sinners

331
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
by your values well

332
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,079
you're in the audience

333
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:47,360
fair enough

334
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
um

335
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
employee development we wanted to talk

336
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,399
about this this time around new new

337
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,079
content

338
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,959
yeah well happens um so there's this

339
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,399
thing that's not very common in new

340
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,800
zealand unfortunately called employee or

341
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,880
staff development

342
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
this is

343
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,959
helping you be better employees by

344
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,360
giving you new tools

345
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
at the very same company with the very

346
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
same manager

347
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
they did not have an employee

348
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,399
development program you remember this

349
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,680
and i went to

350
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,959
management i said you know

351
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,720
it's nice that you let people go to

352
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,639
conference because they they would pay

353
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,839
your way to a conference if you were

354
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,120
going to speak

355
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,800
which is really great when half your

356
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,760
staff is autistic and introverted

357
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,200
um

358
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,519
and i said you know we have things that

359
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,440
you know yes you've got four staff

360
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,360
members who are great at doing this but

361
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,959
we should probably have things for the

362
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,079
other people

363
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,240
have you considered sending them to you

364
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
know

365
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,839
a week of training every six months to

366
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,200
upskill and the manager said to me

367
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,079
approximately

368
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,519
well

369
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,040
if we send them the training what if

370
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
they take the money from the training

371
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,079
learn something good and go somewhere

372
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,680
else it's like

373
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,839
dude what if we don't train them and

374
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,160
they stay here forever

375
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
yeah

376
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,000
so

377
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,160
if you are a manager of skill your

378
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,399
people and talk to them about mental

379
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,920
health and

380
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,079
training doesn't just have to be

381
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,200
how to

382
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,480
cut code better how to do whatever the

383
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
narrow focus of their job is if you help

384
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
them develop into a more functional

385
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
human being they will still be a better

386
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,639
employee generally

387
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
yeah i mean i have a friend that

388
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,200
one of his previous companies

389
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
they gave him a training budget but they

390
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
didn't say it had to be related to his

391
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,399
job and he could just kind of

392
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,800
i don't know take a ski lesson

393
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,639
and call it a training because he got to

394
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,440
train himself profession well like

395
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,320
expand his brand in some regard and

396
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
learn new skills and picking up skills

397
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
in other areas can help improve your

398
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,040
skills in your work area and

399
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,800
also just bring you mental clarity and

400
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,040
happiness and happiness is good happy

401
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,519
employees are in fact more proficient uh

402
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,279
again we said this was interactive and i

403
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,000
see no hands as of yet so oh we got a

404
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,680
hand wait there is

405
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,199
i can't see

406
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,800
hold on

407
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,600
yeah

408
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,519
don't wait don't wait for a break just

409
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,600
raise your hand all right

410
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
what what should i do if i have to go to

411
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,000
sleep every night saying to myself what

412
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,880
management think of me is not who i am

413
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,199
rather than think about what has

414
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,440
happened during the day

415
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
does that make sense

416
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,399
i'm not getting it try again

417
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,000
what should i do if i have to go to

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,639
sleep every night saying to myself quote

419
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,720
what management think of me is not who i

420
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,000
am

421
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,079
rather than think about what has

422
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
happened during the day so

423
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
um

424
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,240
might have them clarify a little bit

425
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,480
um

426
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,240
obviously they're thinking about what

427
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,920
management is thinking of them rather

428
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
than just having enjoying their life

429
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,600
yeah yeah

430
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
but please uh

431
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,880
when the the thing is is that the

432
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
discord is a little might be just a

433
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,360
little behind our conversation

434
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
um but if it comes up again

435
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,639
um or if it gets clarified i'll clarify

436
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,360
it

437
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,760
yeah i guess with

438
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,519
kind of worrying about what people think

439
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,760
i think the best thing to do with that

440
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,600
is kind of talk to the person that

441
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,440
you're worried is thinking

442
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,519
maybe negative things maybe not negative

443
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,759
things and a lot of the time you'll find

444
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,920
that once you actually ask someone hey

445
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
what do you think of me

446
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,199
they'll probably give you a positive

447
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,199
response because

448
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
and you're there on the flip side of

449
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
this having been in the management role

450
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,639
they're not thinking of you when they're

451
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,720
in bed yeah that's true are you thinking

452
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,759
of them

453
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,560
um

454
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,199
it may be a compulsive thought process

455
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,639
and

456
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,399
you need

457
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,720
you know

458
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
overhead

459
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,839
cognitive overhead

460
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,000
you

461
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,199
too many of us engage with this work

462
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,639
every waking moment

463
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,639
and if you love the work that's fine but

464
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
don't think about the management every

465
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
waking moment or what they think of you

466
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,199
and

467
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,199
exterminating those thoughts can be

468
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,199
challenging especially if like me you're

469
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,720
neurotically insecure that's a thing

470
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
um

471
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,519
one of the things that we'll probably

472
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,800
get to later is talking about

473
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,079
perfectionism

474
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,320
perfectionism is the meanest of the

475
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,839
mental illnesses for me because

476
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,920
i've done something wrong i remember it

477
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
forever i do something right i move

478
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,199
right on

479
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,160
and if you suffer from that

480
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,839
it's good to learn techniques to manage

481
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,160
it what those techniques that may be are

482
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,079
different for each person

483
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,000
you might go for meditation you might

484
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
become a person who runs

485
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,720
jigsaw puzzles jigsaw puzzles are

486
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,800
profoundly good for some people my

487
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,560
partner is autistic and

488
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,159
put them into a jigsaw and it's like

489
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,000
gives you something to concentrate on

490
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,240
and take your mind off other things yeah

491
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,760
so if you're lying in bed thinking about

492
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
what does management think of me

493
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,319
well they're not thinking to you um

494
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,640
they're thinking of profitability i mean

495
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
unless unless you are in fact the

496
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,000
problem employee

497
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,599
um in which case you

498
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,240
it's hard to know if you are because if

499
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,520
you are a perfectionist you always

500
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,280
assume you're the problem employee you

501
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,320
did something wrong in february

502
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,679
um

503
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,760
so i hope we've answered that in some

504
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,559
way shape or form nice socks here

505
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,799
um

506
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,799
and yeah continue with questions as as

507
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,679
you have them are you all wearing black

508
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,720
yeah

509
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,880
 security conference wait

510
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,840
i see some some whiter beige over there

511
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,600
i was in the green room before and

512
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
everyone was saying i was very colorful

513
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,240
and

514
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,640
i was the only one not in black yeah

515
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,039
well i've taken off the purple jacket

516
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,039
stage flights yeah

517
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,840
um i guess that kind of brings us into

518
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
our next kind of slide of work

519
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
boundaries um

520
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
because we're only

521
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,520
didn't work for a certain amount of time

522
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,240
per day and

523
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
it's your time like

524
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
if you choose to

525
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,200
think on work then that's kind of

526
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
not a great space it's not sustainable

527
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
really you need to kind of have that

528
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,960
divide of

529
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,919
work and yourself and hopefully sleep as

530
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,559
well because sleep is really important

531
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,120
and also

532
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,679
why do you want to give

533
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,640
your employer all that free time

534
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
all that free overhead they are you know

535
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,120
break out what you are making on an

536
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,679
hourly basis and cut it off at eight per

537
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,679
day 40 per week ideally 37.5 per week

538
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,919
ideally move to a four day week of 32

539
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,120
because the

540
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,200
studies show that productivity is the

541
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,679
same for 32 versus 40 but you get

542
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,080
happier employees yes you can look this

543
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,720
stuff up on the magic of the internet

544
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
um and happy employees are most

545
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,679
definitely more productive yeah

546
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,760
it's just a thing happy employees are

547
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,200
more productive how can you make your

548
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
employees happier how can you be happier

549
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,760
at work that is the secret to better

550
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,600
productivity it is not

551
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,280
i'm going to go home and hack on this

552
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,919
until i fall asleep

553
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,760
crack on other things hack on things

554
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,039
that you love that aren't related to

555
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,440
your employer but

556
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
don't don't give them free you you're

557
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,200
worth more than more than that

558
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,360
speaking of work boundaries

559
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,840
it's quite tough cool at the moment

560
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
yeah so if you haven't anybody here

561
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,480
heard of covet 19.

562
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,880
again no hands

563
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,919
um

564
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,919
if you're working from home

565
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,440
it's not really working home at the

566
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,840
moment it's attempting to work during a

567
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,880
pandemic you just happen to be at home

568
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
yeah though if if you're a manager and

569
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,200
you're expecting the same productivity

570
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
out of your team while they're working

571
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,919
from home

572
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,200
 you

573
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
um

574
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,919
they're having you know

575
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
you've you know some of your people will

576
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
have three kids screaming around them at

577
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,840
all times demanding attention not

578
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,360
understanding why daddy's not paying or

579
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,760
mommy's not being or non-gendered parent

580
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
is not paying attention

581
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,640
and it's hard it is not

582
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,039
functional to actually work from home

583
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,720
everybody's doing their best and respect

584
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
doing their best but also

585
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,240
if you are the employee and not the

586
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
manager don't do too much

587
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,159
give yourself allowance to not be

588
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,720
working from home but being trying to

589
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,480
working from home and have the

590
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
boundaries so like

591
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
if you

592
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,520
like don't work for your bed and just

593
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,120
like eat sleep and

594
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,600
work in your bed have like a separate

595
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,360
space that's your workspace and then

596
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,520
another separate space that's

597
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,679
your play space and

598
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,320
kind of separate the work and

599
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
personal stuff

600
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,840
uh naturally i think we've got another

601
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,000
yeah yep

602
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,720
hopefully you can see me when i stand up

603
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
this is this is this is excellent i've

604
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,840
got one

605
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
i've got one meaning i've got a question

606
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,400
um

607
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,360
my experience of infosec sector

608
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,840
development tends to be either brief

609
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,320
highs of things working great followed

610
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,440
by long troughs or why can't you just

611
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
find that bug or get that shell

612
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
is this a widely held experience

613
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,880
and curious what the speaker's thoughts

614
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,400
on making it all a bit more sustainable

615
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,799
um i guess with the

616
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,159
long bouts of not finding stuff it's

617
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,640
quite a problem in infosec i've found

618
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,720
because i i used to be a developer and

619
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,799
as a developer you kind of make stuff

620
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,559
and you have a

621
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,960
achievable goal that you know whether

622
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
you've finished or not but in security

623
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
the the output's normally just a report

624
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,679
of hey i've got a report

625
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,159
and sometimes it feels not great when

626
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,240
the report's got nothing in it but in

627
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,840
reality that's actually good for the

628
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,080
client that you haven't found a lot of

629
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,840
issues and

630
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,280
yeah you kind of

631
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
have to realize that

632
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,200
even if you don't find a bunch of stuff

633
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,000
it's not a bad thing

634
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,799
and

635
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,880
stop beating up on yourself

636
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,760
yeah

637
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,679
trying

638
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,159
when your work is a negative output

639
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,840
because that's what this is you're

640
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,360
looking for you're looking for things

641
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,240
and not finding them uh try to regard it

642
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,400
more as playing golf where the lowest

643
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,000
score wins

644
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,120
um

645
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,400
it's it's it's more of a a meditative

646
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,679
pursuit

647
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,960
and again finding too much of your

648
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,480
self-worth

649
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,600
in your paying job

650
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,559
not the best way to go find self-worth

651
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,480
yes take pride in the work you do but

652
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,039
how can how can i be a better human when

653
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,799
i'm doing the work and when i'm not

654
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,480
doing the work

655
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,400
and work on your humaning skills in

656
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,480
addition i see a hand i think this is

657
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,480
related

658
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
so when i started out as a pen tester in

659
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,400
the street this is silly

660
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,679
i love it

661
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,000
but had this exact same problem right so

662
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,480
speaking from experience

663
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,760
or maybe they'll find something and i

664
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,120
learned something from that and i feel

665
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,640
good about that as well

666
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,400
or um we both do frustrating

667
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,799
yeah so what tc's talking about is is

668
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,159
getting the external validation and

669
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,679
actually when you feel this way talking

670
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,000
to your team and getting them to come in

671
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,679
and look at what you're looking at and

672
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,679
seeing if it's not just you

673
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,919
um did you guys hear any of that yeah we

674
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,039
heard all of it

675
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,799
you can repeat it better than me i think

676
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,840
that's uh really good as well because um

677
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,159
i guess uh back when i was working as a

678
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,200
developer you you have more teamwork as

679
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,440
a developer and like

680
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,600
first security where a lot of the time

681
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
you're kind of working by yourself and

682
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
you're siloed off in your world and it's

683
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,320
kind of easy to kind of build this echo

684
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,400
chamber in a way that you're not finding

685
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,480
stuff and when you actually stop and ask

686
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
your colleagues hey can you have a quick

687
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
look at this and see if you can find

688
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,559
anything that i've missed that just

689
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,440
makes

690
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,799
a lot of stress come off you because now

691
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,720
you've got someone else to kind of

692
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
validate whether there is nothing or no

693
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
there is something there and it gives

694
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
you a learning opportunity and it

695
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,520
expands your skill set uh question over

696
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
there

697
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,159
one second

698
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,679
all right

699
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,760
if you don't have enough physical space

700
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,679
to be able to separate work and

701
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,240
everything else at home i totally get it

702
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,600
uh do you have any good ways of mentally

703
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,200
compartmentalizing these things uh go

704
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
for a walk in between

705
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
working and

706
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,320
doing something else

707
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,640
um just have a way to like physically

708
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,039
split your work day from your personal

709
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,919
day as if you were leaving the office

710
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,640
and going to home one thing

711
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,520
so i

712
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,440
commute by cycle and one thing during

713
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,600
the latest lockdown i was thinking it

714
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,080
was a bit weird but i jumped on my bike

715
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,000
and just biked around the block back to

716
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,240
home and that was my commute

717
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,000
and it felt weird to start with because

718
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
i was not really going anywhere but

719
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,279
my brain was telling me i've gone

720
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,520
somewhere i'm now at work and

721
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,320
it

722
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,159
made it slightly easier to concentrate

723
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,919
on work

724
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,640
and dress for work

725
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,600
get up

726
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,520
shower act like you're doing the thing

727
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,200
of going into the office

728
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
put on office appropriate t-shirt as

729
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,600
opposed to your regular home t-shirt

730
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,440
i have the advantage that

731
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,880
you know a lot of what i do is in the

732
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,600
horror of video conferencing so

733
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,039
yeah i put on a suit or a blazer and do

734
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,159
my hair

735
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,360
it's awesome

736
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,919
and uh

737
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,279
i i do the professional presents

738
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,440
uh for people who are coders i know some

739
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,679
friends who

740
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,559
keep a vid conference channel open

741
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,760
and

742
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,240
sit and code silently with people across

743
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,520
a vid channel

744
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,919
just the sound of more people banging on

745
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,159
keys is comforting

746
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,960
and

747
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,159
we were evolved to hunt in packs and do

748
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,559
things as teams

749
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,960
and isolation isn't good for us so

750
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,760
find a way to maintain engagement

751
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,279
uh beyond the whichever

752
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,960
comms channel you use for strictly text

753
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,679
text is good for most of us okay another

754
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,520
question from the floor here

755
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,080
in light of how vulnerability equals bad

756
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,600
in infosec can you discuss the topic of

757
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
emotional vulnerability and mental

758
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,918
health

759
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,799
do you want to go shall i oh you you go

760
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,679
that was deep no no i'm fine on that one

761
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,720
um

762
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
the thing is

763
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,279
infosec as we started out on this topic

764
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,039
is up

765
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,360
a thing to

766
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,440
come from the standpoint of first and

767
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,120
foremost is

768
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
you are valuable

769
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,480
there is no shortage of jobs out there

770
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,720
if your management doesn't like you

771
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,880
being the human being you are

772
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,960
fine you can go find other management

773
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,399
you probably get a pay raise in the

774
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,240
process

775
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,919
i looked at the numbers of sponsors of

776
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:19,279
this event it seems like there are a

777
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,640
fair number of employers willing to

778
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,159
throw money around to sponsor a small

779
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,279
event

780
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,799
the reason employers sponsor these

781
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,640
events is not just because they're cool

782
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,080
but because they want your body

783
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,000
hopefully your brain

784
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,919
um

785
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:34,880
so

786
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
practice being you appropriately there

787
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
are appropriate work boundaries but if

788
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
you're feeling stressed it's good to

789
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,399
talk about feeling stressed because you

790
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,600
know everybody else on the team is

791
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,039
probably feeling it too you're not that

792
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,880
unique

793
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,120
and there are healthy

794
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,840
and work appropriate ways to talk about

795
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
the you know

796
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,039
you're having a tough time with this

797
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,840
stuff

798
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,919
and open-ended questions are a great

799
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,600
thing just

800
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
ask other people that you are that are

801
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,520
on your team saying

802
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,120
man i'm i'm having

803
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,960
this type of pressure with this what's

804
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,799
your experience and what's your

805
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,120
experience not leaving them yes or no

806
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,200
are you having are you having attention

807
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,480
to yes

808
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,080
but what's your experience it's like

809
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,120
well

810
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,440
it it makes it wider

811
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,399
and

812
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,639
the

813
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,360
just if management discourages you

814
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,679
talking as human beings you want to find

815
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,679
other management and the management

816
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,279
should

817
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,039
they're human beings too and they have

818
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,279
stressors too and they should respect

819
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,360
and participate i'm not

820
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,399
talking you know

821
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,559
having encounter groups that work

822
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,080
necessarily

823
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,840
but the work and the stress and the

824
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,640
pressure are absolutely part of our

825
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,640
very messed up industry

826
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,559
so we should talk about that part of it

827
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,279
as well and normalize talking about the

828
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,360
stressors that go with the work that we

829
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,480
do

830
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,399
i mean personally i've found since i've

831
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,039
opened up more about my issues

832
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,360
i found that a lot of people just have

833
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,760
similar issues and i used to think i was

834
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,000
the only one but really it's actually

835
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
the majority of people i know kind of

836
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,480
have some issue of some kind we've got

837
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,159
another question down there yeah i've

838
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,080
got two things one was a comment about

839
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
the previous one about you know working

840
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,840
and living in a small space and trying

841
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,960
to separate the two and it was a

842
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,279
suggestion about changing the lighting

843
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,120
you know between you know being at work

844
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,039
and and you know just just having your

845
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,279
everyday everyday um

846
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,840
everyday life and have another one here

847
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,600
yeah awesome so as a people leader how

848
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,360
would you support your team going

849
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,880
through these mental health crisis

850
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,960
what's your recommendations what's some

851
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,679
of your ideas and plans for a people

852
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,799
leader

853
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,880
have regular catch-ups with them and

854
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,760
kind of treat them as human so you can

855
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,440
kind of

856
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,440
have catch-ups more on the personal side

857
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,200
and then catch ups more on the

858
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,480
professional outcome side and

859
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
kind of just bond with them as a human

860
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,159
instead of as a

861
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,840
manager and kind of

862
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,600
i don't know almost like flatten that

863
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,399
hierarchy out and let them know that

864
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,320
you're approachable to actually talk

865
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,399
about any issues that might be coming up

866
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,600
with them

867
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,559
and then

868
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,640
they will be more responsive and

869
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,320
probably let you know

870
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,559
stuff is happening when it's happening

871
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,519
before it becomes a professional problem

872
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,600
like further down the track

873
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,039
and also you know again you're a manager

874
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,480
you're a human being

875
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,120
employee also a human being talk to them

876
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,399
like human beings schedule time

877
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,080
you know even 10 minutes a week it's

878
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,240
like hey friday at 10 30 let's vid

879
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,799
conference have a cup of tea ready we're

880
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,799
not going to talk about this project

881
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,919
we're just going to

882
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,919
talk as human beings

883
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,840
the thing that many

884
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,919
more reports forget than managers do

885
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,120
hopefully

886
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,200
is that the purpose of management is to

887
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,240
help you

888
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,320
they are there to support you they are

889
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,799
there to be the tool set that interfaces

890
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,360
with higher management to get you the

891
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,760
things you need to perform better if

892
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,720
they are

893
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,440
focused on

894
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,519
flogging you to get more results they're

895
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,279
not a manager

896
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,480
they're a task master

897
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,159
you know you

898
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,279
uh a bit of a follow-up question like um

899
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,120
can you provide some clues as to what to

900
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,519
look out for when when you know they are

901
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,600
going people are going through mental

902
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,039
health issues

903
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,960
um if you don't quite have that

904
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,039
relationship with them yet

905
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:50,880
what are some things that you can say i

906
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,039
think daniel kind of alluded to it

907
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,320
before that if they start becoming not

908
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,960
themselves or like not as performant or

909
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,000
changes in behavior yeah more irritable

910
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,200
like

911
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,080
just turning up late or not at all or

912
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,399
skipping meetings like stuff like that

913
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,320
if they didn't normally used to do that

914
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
before maybe ask hey is something else

915
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
going on that is kind of

916
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,679
causing all this yeah short-temperedness

917
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,880
in somebody who's usually not

918
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,039
short-tempered patience and somebody who

919
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,960
usually is short-tempered

920
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,679
i'm not joking here they're you know

921
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,840
they're kind of just the extremes yeah

922
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,200
it's it's the changes yeah and

923
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
you want to if you detect

924
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,399
their if one if

925
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,240
you're not in touch enough with your

926
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,120
team

927
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,200
to be able to spot changes at all be

928
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,760
more in touch with your team because you

929
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,960
need to

930
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,080
especially in security

931
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,600
know that people are doing all right and

932
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,880
if they're not doing all right how you

933
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,279
can support them and getting all right

934
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,640
because stability is the core of any

935
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,840
security operation

936
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
yeah yeah so where are we on the slides

937
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,320
anyway we're doing another one uh

938
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,720
depreciation

939
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,040
man that's another culturally sensitive

940
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,879
one yeah depression is different for

941
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,399
everyone um

942
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,799
yeah i mean my operating threshold i

943
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,399
i am chronic nose

944
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,280
diagnosed chronic depressive and hey i'm

945
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,560
up here on stage and i seem pretty

946
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,399
engaged and i'm doing well and i am

947
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,879
doing kind of well this year you know um

948
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,280
isolation from other human beings is

949
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,839
really nice thank you i like

950
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,159
this it's been beautiful free nearly

951
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,520
freaked out at the airport today because

952
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
a lot of people were hanging their noses

953
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,879
over their masks and crowding me didn't

954
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,839
like that at all but what you know

955
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,440
depression

956
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,480
has the basic two styles as i mentioned

957
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,239
with anxiety which is chronic or

958
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,520
episodic

959
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,119
your nana dies you're going to be

960
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,839
depressed that is an episodic depressed

961
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,399
depression stimulant it's like i have

962
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,280
had an incident and i am going to have

963
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,680
some sad about that for a month six

964
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,480
months

965
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
five years whatever it takes everybody

966
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,680
deals with that sort of thing

967
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,599
differently chronic depression is you

968
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,720
just wake up and it's always gray

969
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,160
and

970
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,119
that is a matter of bad brain chemistry

971
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,839
and the insidious thing about it is you

972
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,560
don't know because

973
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,599
it reduces the function of the tool that

974
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,079
tells you that you're not doing well

975
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,760
so

976
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,560
at one point a very long time ago

977
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,880
i noticed it was july

978
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,320
which was odd because i thought it was

979
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,000
january and i had lost six

980
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,359
months

981
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,280
i wasn't working

982
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
i

983
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,440
don't know what i was doing

984
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,079
i apparently was managing enough to feed

985
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,320
myself clothe myself

986
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,480
somehow maintain an income

987
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
but i really was not aware of life or

988
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,680
time

989
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,720
and

990
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,119
that is a proper

991
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,200
serious depression and it took me

992
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,400
forever to notice that i was

993
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,520
i i wasn't even miserable i just wasn't

994
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,920
i wasn't feeling anything particularly

995
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,800
and there are all sorts of tools that i

996
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,359
used both standard tools like

997
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,040
psychiatry

998
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
drugs

999
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,760
therapy

1000
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,520
and other tools that i learned such as

1001
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,760
my favorite is the success journal

1002
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,839
every day

1003
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,000
i would set an alarm and at 5 pm i would

1004
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,240
write down 5 things i succeeded at that

1005
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,200
day

1006
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,599
and sometimes that would look like

1007
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,079
i fed myself breakfast i fed myself

1008
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,119
lunch i fed myself dinner i successfully

1009
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,800
watched tv for five hours

1010
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,200
that sounds like survival but if that's

1011
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,960
all you've got those are your successes

1012
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,480
for the day and after three months when

1013
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,920
you look back on

1014
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,800
wait

1015
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
it's september now what happened it's

1016
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,079
like oh

1017
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,119
wait

1018
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,920
i've been surviving

1019
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,839
it's uh it's getting close to end time

1020
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,119
so i want to make sure if you do have

1021
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,800
some questions how many more slides do

1022
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,839
we have

1023
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,359
fewer hit the button yeah hit the button

1024
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,280
um just um what you just talked about a

1025
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,480
little bit danielle was the the

1026
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,920
self-identifying um do you have more uh

1027
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,000
kind of clues i guess to self-identify

1028
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,119
that you're actually going through some

1029
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,240
stuff that you really need to talk to

1030
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,640
someone about is that something did i

1031
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,400
come close to that one

1032
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,960
yeah it's

1033
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,280
what were some clue what would have been

1034
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,880
clues that you look back on and be like

1035
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,640
oh you know

1036
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
it made it a bit more obvious that if i

1037
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,160
had listened to myself at that point in

1038
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
time maybe i would have found this out a

1039
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,000
year ago or something the problem is

1040
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,960
your cognitive set is damaged

1041
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,880
when you are depressed

1042
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,200
you're you're not perceiving well

1043
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,599
and it helps to have external people to

1044
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,119
check in with

1045
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,320
who look at you and say

1046
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,000
that's not right and unfortunately our

1047
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,680
modern society and lockdown encourages

1048
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
and our industry for that matter

1049
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,680
encourages a lot of lonerism

1050
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,720
and we're just not built for it

1051
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,800
having somebody to talk to

1052
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,839
you know the great thing i i'm so

1053
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,640
 not pro church but the great

1054
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,160
thing about having religious communities

1055
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,520
is you're forced to check in every week

1056
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,440
and people are watching you and people

1057
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,720
can detect when you're going off the

1058
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,680
rails

1059
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,720
so having a gaming community is great

1060
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,520
because your gaming community will say

1061
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,760
oh you're not doing so well and check in

1062
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,800
with you

1063
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,440
um i'll kind of notice that you're

1064
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,160
different i have the advantage of having

1065
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
a spouse who said by the way

1066
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,599
i'm going to divorce you if you don't

1067
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,000
get out of this it's like oh i didn't

1068
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
know i was in something i wish it'd take

1069
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,520
less than six months

1070
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,839
um

1071
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:58,960
again

1072
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
the problem with

1073
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,880
noticing your own depression is noticing

1074
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,040
that you're depressed

1075
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,839
it it takes a sophisticated sensor to be

1076
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,680
able to pick that up

1077
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,240
because it's your sensorium that is not

1078
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,480
working correctly i wish i could give a

1079
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,119
better answer

1080
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,560
sometimes sad is sad sometimes it's sad

1081
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,839
which is seasonal affective disorder

1082
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,839
especially further south you

1083
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,320
go it gets dark

1084
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,839
not this time of year

1085
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,119
this time of year it's getting light and

1086
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,320
that's lovely

1087
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
but if you are a person who yeah when it

1088
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,720
becomes autumn and the light

1089
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,040
is less and you start becoming a dimmer

1090
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,720
person

1091
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,240
there are all sorts of things you can do

1092
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,920
for that including the marvelous

1093
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,160
technology of blue light there are blue

1094
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,079
lights you can buy online that give you

1095
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,280
the

1096
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,839
extra bit of

1097
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,160
synthetic sunlight that you need to help

1098
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,920
moderate your seasonal affective

1099
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,160
disorder

1100
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,079
vitamin d also helps vitamin d vitamin a

1101
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:04,880
uh

1102
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,560
there are studies to support

1103
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,800
vitamins these are known vitamins these

1104
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,480
are not unknown rando supplements

1105
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,640
always do your research but

1106
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,599
always do your research

1107
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,880
i was going to say something else about

1108
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,240
sad but i can't remember what it is

1109
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,359
yeah

1110
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,280
um he or

1111
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,480
evil's just

1112
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,760
sad all the time and you know what and

1113
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,160
the other animals love him yeah and

1114
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,359
include him

1115
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,119
and bringing him along

1116
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,640
and yeah he's gonna be like that so

1117
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,079
when your friends are being like that

1118
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,720
include them sometimes nudge them

1119
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,720
sometimes you have to drag eor along

1120
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,880
with you

1121
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,079
don't be

1122
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,079
too invasive an but just

1123
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,960
invasive enough

1124
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,480
don't let your friends isolate because

1125
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,359
they just say no i'm not feeling like it

1126
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,400
great i'll come over i'll bring pizza

1127
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,560
yeah

1128
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,400
so what can you do when you

1129
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,319
can't ask for help you feel like you're

1130
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,960
kind of trapped in your own self and

1131
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,599
there's no one you can kind of turn to

1132
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,200
it can be quite daunting um

1133
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,680
make you feel quite isolated and in this

1134
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,480
day and age that there's quite a

1135
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,400
it's a thing yeah it definitely is a

1136
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,560
thing um

1137
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,560
there are lots of places where i've been

1138
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,599
where i just

1139
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,280
could not ask for help

1140
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
i didn't know i needed to ask for help i

1141
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,439
mean self-perception

1142
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,680
you know as a person

1143
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,839
to learn

1144
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,160
to be a successfully chronic depressed

1145
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,839
person who still performs you have to

1146
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,440
learn all sorts of special skills that

1147
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,359
they don't teach you in school

1148
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,560
and that is partially checking in with

1149
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,079
yourself it's like you might even have a

1150
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,000
checklist for yourself

1151
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,760
am i feeling this am i feeling this if

1152

1153
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,280

1154
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,200
this call suicide hotline

1155
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,880
they're there for a reason

1156
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,000
um

1157
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,760
gumboot friday we all know that it's

1158

1159
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,280
gumboots but i'm slogging anyway um

1160
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,960
if you can't ask for help sometimes

1161
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,640
you're the first person that you need to

1162
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,240
ask and one of the great things about it

1163
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,760
and security people is we're good at

1164
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,920
checklists

1165
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,400
i mean one thing for me is i i keep a

1166
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,040
journal every day and i kind of talk i

1167
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,440
check in with myself like sometimes you

1168
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
don't need someone else you can just

1169
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,119
kind of self-check and then write down

1170
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,720
in your journal hey this is what i did

1171
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
today and then you as you're writing you

1172
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
might think actually that wasn't a good

1173
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,119
day because i did this and i didn't

1174
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,480
actually do what i wanted to do or i

1175
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,880
didn't have fun or i wasn't happy but

1176
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,720
you might not know until you actually

1177
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,040
kind of get it from your brain into

1178
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
writing and actually write it down i'm

1179
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,000
noticing

1180
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,920
hugh's holding his hand like this like

1181
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,520
he's writing with a

1182
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,520
physical analog interface device

1183
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,359
it's much different from just tapping on

1184
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,680
your phone that that doesn't do the same

1185
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,280
thing for a living

1186
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,240
do your

1187
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,520
journaling or your mental health

1188
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,079
check-ins with a pen

1189
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,359
not not not in a database not in a file

1190
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,400
because

1191
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,040
your brain goes on automatic it's it's

1192
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,599
more intimate it's more physical it gets

1193
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,800
you and yeah um

1194
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,520
if you can't ask for help

1195
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,200
and you think you need help and you just

1196
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,920
can't ask

1197
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,599
start with routines

1198
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,240
alarm clock alarm clock is your friend

1199
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,960
alarm clock goes off at x time or end

1200
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,839
time depending on where you

1201
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,599
live right turn off the alarm get up

1202
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:43,200
make the bed right away get in the

1203
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,880
shower right away

1204
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,160
force yourself into routines to human

1205
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,599
humaning is hard it requires effort

1206
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,599
but human up

1207
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,079
routines definitely help

1208
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,200
feelings

1209
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,480
are hard though

1210
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,800
also being old is hard so that's marvin

1211
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,119
the paranoid android uh from a

1212
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,920
hitchhiker's guide series what 35 40

1213
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,560
years ago a few years back yeah wow i

1214
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,640
don't recall it sadly yeah well

1215
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,640
i actually listened to the radio series

1216
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,000
when it was new

1217
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,319
um

1218
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,760
yes so feelings are hard

1219
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,040
feel them

1220
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,119
and if they're miserable feelings try to

1221
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,119
share them because

1222
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,280
the weird thing there there is this

1223
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,680
commutative property of feeling where if

1224
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,560
you

1225
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,160
share the negative feelings your

1226
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,319
experiences is reduced and if you share

1227
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:38,319
the positive feelings your experience of

1228
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,480
them is increased

1229
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,520
so sharing of the feelings is really

1230
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,960
important regardless of what the

1231
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,319
feelings are

1232
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,560
and finding the people with whom you can

1233
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,800
share those feelings

1234
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,960
world of warcraft guilds are awesome for

1235
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,000
this

1236
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,960
um

1237
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,520
your team might be awesome for this you

1238
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,640
might do

1239
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,520
you know

1240
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,520
let's do the 10 30 check-in every day

1241
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,200
how the hell are you feeling

1242
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,160
and just everybody gets five seconds

1243
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,240
timed to go through

1244
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,599
you know

1245
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,440
no matter how shitty it is there's no

1246
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,960
judgment that's like

1247
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,680
uh my kid is sick my father's dying it's

1248
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,280
all being hard move on right expressing

1249
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,119
them and expressing them to another

1250
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,760
human being

1251
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,599
it's what we pretty much have done for

1252
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,520
tens of thousands of years

1253
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,720
and it's important to know that

1254
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,720
sometimes you might not actually know

1255
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,640
what you're feeling but if you actually

1256
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,040
stop and talk to someone and try and get

1257
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,560
it out you might become aware of what it

1258
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,319
is you're feeling but if you and if

1259
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,680
you're too introverted to talk to a

1260
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,040
person write it in your journal yep

1261
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,880
the journal is the introvert's best

1262
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,200
friend

1263
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,520
i like this one

1264
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,839
what does this be anxious about

1265
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,440
everything really

1266
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,040
yeah um

1267
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,960
i was pretty anxious coming up here that

1268
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,800
here i am i'm still probably not me

1269
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,960
because i took my benzodiazepine the uh

1270
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,359
also i

1271
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,760
have gotten you know 20 years practice

1272
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,319
sitting on well sitting standing on

1273
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,319
stage sitting is just

1274
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,280
luxury it's different i am loving this i

1275
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,200
reckon the lights are different as well

1276
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,040
because normally my head's up here but

1277
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,119
yeah so they are a bit more in your eyes

1278
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,880
right now yeah it's interesting because

1279
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,079
i've done a bunch of technical talks but

1280
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,000
recently i've started doing these like

1281
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,720
soft talks and they're different like i

1282
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,920
feel less confident about doing it but

1283
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,560
well hard talks you know technical talks

1284
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,160
we're talking about a defined subject

1285
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,480
that's easy yeah you can study it and

1286
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,839
there's going to be one person in the

1287
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,880
room who

1288
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,960
you're wrong on that yeah you're wrong

1289
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,640
yeah but you're not on the stage

1290
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,839
um

1291
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,680
this is intimate and intimacy you know

1292
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,079
part of i did not start doing these

1293
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:01,680
talks until i

1294
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,119
was

1295
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,400
full-time

1296
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,319
working for myself and did not have to

1297
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,319
worry about employers and if my clients

1298
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,160
want to fire me for this i don't want

1299
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,000
them as clients anyway

1300
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,119
um

1301
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,359
i

1302
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,359
feel that i have a lot to offer the

1303
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,599
world by being one of the people who

1304
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,359
will get up here and say yes i've had

1305
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,040
two nervous breakdowns because of the

1306
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,160
nzit industry and uh

1307
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,839
that doesn't necessarily make employers

1308
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,160
want to have you because they think

1309
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,520
you're prone to it and it's nothing to

1310
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,280
do with your employers it's like

1311
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,000
nah nah the lawsuits in one case that

1312
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,079
but it was definitely the employer and

1313
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,680
employers don't like them you'll sue

1314
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,880
either so

1315
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,480
um

1316
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,920
what is there to be anxious about i'm

1317
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,559
anxious about carrington events yeah

1318
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,359
yeah

1319
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,160
carrington events are uh when you have a

1320
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,800
really large coronal mass ejection and

1321
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,960
the number of fast neutrons hitting the

1322
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,520
planet increases so radically that it

1323
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,960
damages

1324
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,480
electrical infrastructure the one in

1325
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,160
1859

1326
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,480
caused actual telegraph offices to catch

1327
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,880
on fire because of the amount of

1328
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,640
fast neutrons hitting the copper wires

1329
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,480
that were strung across the country and

1330
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,960
uh we nearly had one plane crash in 2008

1331
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,119
due to a bit flip incident uh from a

1332
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:16,400
carrington event

1333
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,160
uh so that's what i'm anxious about

1334
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,040
today global warming minor

1335
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,240
um

1336
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,160
do i let my concern about carrying two

1337
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,680
events affect me professionally

1338
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,839
that would be crazier than i am right

1339
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:30,720
now

1340
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,559
and that would be the anxiety getting

1341
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,319
completely out of control and i can't

1342
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:35,359
tell if

1343
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:37,680
it's just the drugs that are working

1344
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,599
that i take three times a day for the

1345
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,559
chronic anxiety or

1346
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,240
there's just all nothing i can do

1347
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,000
about carrington events except encourage

1348
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,200
people to do

1349
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,119
uh three-tiered processing and have two

1350
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,720
processors agreeing at all times to

1351
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:53,440
present prevent that flip yeah

1352
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,800
all right i've got another another

1353
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,880
question well

1354
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,680
as

1355
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,720
a lot of the crowd here are defenders

1356
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,760
and

1357
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,319
when the bad thing happens and the

1358
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,640
management comes down and says why did

1359
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,880
the bad thing happen

1360
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,960
what are some of the tactics to deal

1361
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,160
with that sort of negativity coming down

1362
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,280
from from up top when you know what some

1363
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,400
of those tactics that you guys employ

1364
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,440
i guess

1365
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,160
in general if like uh

1366
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,000
people are approaching you in a negative

1367
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,839
light you need to kind of step back and

1368
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,640
think

1369
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,640
what's the other person feeling like why

1370
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,480
are they kind of approaching this from a

1371
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,400
negative angle and they've probably got

1372
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,240
things that they're worried about and if

1373
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,359
you try and work out what they're

1374
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,079
worried about and talk to that

1375
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,520
rather than

1376
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,240
be

1377
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,480
defensive and try and protect yourself

1378
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,839
sometimes you have to be a bit

1379
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,520
vulnerable and express

1380
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,520
acknowledgement that you understand what

1381
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,000
the other person's feeling and then they

1382
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,400
kind of in turn become a bit more open

1383
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,680
and

1384
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:58,400
less

1385
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,680
attacky on you um in a way but yeah it's

1386
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,640
it's a hard situation um especially when

1387
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,440
like

1388
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,880
negativity is getting directed at you

1389
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,720
your default instinct is to become

1390
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,400
defensive but

1391
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,400
in some ways you have to be

1392
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,800
almost the option become more vulnerable

1393
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,040
and kind of accept it and just

1394
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,720
understand what the other person is

1395
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,200
going through yeah as as a former you

1396
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,720
know owner of an i.t company that had a

1397
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,680
bunch of employees

1398
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:32,800
fuck-ups happen and

1399
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,240
that's just the nature of things

1400
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,800
as an employer i tried not to be

1401
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,720
negative with my people what my main

1402
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,000
concern is

1403
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
what was the thing and how do we prevent

1404
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,160
the thing in the future

1405
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,520
in some cases that's firing a person

1406
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,440
and

1407
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,440
as a manager you can fire a person from

1408
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,359
a standpoint of yes love what is good

1409
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,680
for this person i had one person who i

1410
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,160
fired who

1411
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,760
the job was go every week and

1412
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,760
power cycle a printer for a doctor

1413
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,280
and he went because the doctor wants to

1414
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,559
publish his report and doesn't know what

1415
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:11,760
to do

1416
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,800
and this

1417
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,960
guy was brilliant and went in

1418
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,119
and rewrote the printer drivers and took

1419
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,200
about a day and a half on it

1420
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,880
and that printer would never malfunction

1421
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,640
again the doctor wanted to print his

1422
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,160
report in half an hour like he always

1423
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,440
did not wait another day and also we

1424
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,800
lost the client because the doctor

1425
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,280
wanted to report like he always did i

1426
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,119
fired that person successfully and told

1427
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,160
him to

1428
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,520
go find a job where he's just not

1429
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,280
customer facing because he's

1430
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,720
really good

1431
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,400
and you can hire him today because he's

1432
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,079
one of the top robotics consultants in

1433
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:43,680
san francisco and i've actually

1434
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,760
performed his wedding for him

1435
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,280
i think if you can fire somebody so

1436
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,720
effectively that they ask you to perform

1437
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,559
their wedding you're doing a good job

1438
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,880
um

1439
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,079
management should not it's not if

1440
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,280
they're doing it right it's not about

1441
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,559
blaming you for the thing that went

1442
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,640
wrong they want to know the root cause

1443
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,240
of what run wrong so we don't have the

1444
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,440
wrong thing again because the wrong

1445
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,280
thing upsets the client and the

1446
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
reason the manager is upset is typically

1447
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,119
because the client has just shut down

1448
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,000
their throat and they do not like that

1449
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,680
and you are getting some of the rub off

1450
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,040
from that and if they're a proficient

1451
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,079
manager

1452
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:20,240
they center before they go talk to you

1453
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,960
um

1454
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,760
with the anxiety thing

1455
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,280
one thing i

1456
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,040
try and think of is when i'm anxious

1457
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,559
about something i think

1458
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,880
can i actually control the outcome of

1459
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,880
the thing i'm worrying about and if the

1460
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,119
answer is no i tend

1461
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,040
to worry less because what's the point

1462
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,559
of worrying on something that you can't

1463
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,720
control and it kind of relates to

1464
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,520
if a manager is coming down on you

1465
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,200
they need to work out

1466
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,640
what

1467
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,720
can be controlled and in this case what

1468
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,280
can be controlled is the future outcome

1469
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,800
and there's no point dwelling on the

1470
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,160
past but

1471
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,319
we should jump on another step because

1472
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,599
we're running a

1473
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,040
bit short

1474
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,640
um

1475
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,520
parties are hard

1476
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,839
parties are hard work is hard if you are

1477
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,480
an introvert introvert

1478
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,880
teams are hard and it's okay the teams

1479
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,720
are hard and you want to

1480
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,480
start by addressing your new team by

1481
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,920
saying hi

1482
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,920
this is awkward and it will always be

1483
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,440
awkward for me

1484
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,240
so

1485
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,200
you know

1486
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,280
own who you are

1487
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,760
our industry is more often than not made

1488
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,920
of introverts so owning your

1489
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,480
introversion should not be embarrassing

1490
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,160
and

1491
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,559
finding the one person who you know if

1492
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,160
there's a person on your team that you

1493
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,680
can partner with

1494
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,720
to ask you leading questions to do your

1495
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,400
stand-ups or whatever

1496
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,680
great

1497
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,160
build your own coping mechanisms

1498
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,800
we're all fairly above standard thinkers

1499
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,880
and intellects in this room it's the

1500
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,559
nature of our industry

1501
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:59,119
it's just how it is

1502
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:01,200
find your own rules that work within the

1503
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,559
rules of what's appropriate for a

1504
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,319
business setting

1505
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,720
and there's a lot more flexibility if

1506
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,880
you bring the flexibility yourself

1507
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,960
because management wants you to succeed

1508
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,200
their management wants it to make money

1509
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,640
happy teams make more money

1510
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,760
why don't you be happier daniel

1511
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,599
be happy

1512
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,240
 you you don't worry

1513
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,359
don't worry be happy yeah um

1514
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:31,839
if only it was that simple way like

1515
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,280
sometimes people will just come up to

1516
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,640
you and like you're not having a great

1517
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,559
day and they're like oh have you tried

1518
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:37,599
just

1519
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:38,640
being

1520
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,720
happier about life and it's just like

1521
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,880
it's you can't do that when you're

1522
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,559
having an anxiety attack you can't

1523
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:47,040
meditate

1524
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,079
they they self-cancel but what you can

1525
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,280
do

1526
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,400
is

1527
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,680
basic meat infrastructure management

1528
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,839
are you breathing

1529
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,359
try to breathe

1530
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,920
remember to breathe strangely

1531
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,280
the part of your brain that's dealing

1532
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,040
with anxiety seems like the part of your

1533
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,880
brain that also deals with autonomic

1534
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,640
systems like breathing

1535
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,240
you have to stop and focus on the

1536
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,760
breathing part you'll be much better

1537
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,240
with air

1538
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,400
bodies especially in this century it

1539
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,680
seems

1540
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,839
we're bad at hydrating

1541
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,880
and you know v does count it's a it's a

1542
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,880
myth that caffeine

1543
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,480
you know yes it's a diuretic doesn't

1544
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,480
matter you're still having fluid keep

1545
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,720
having fluid make sure you're hydrated

1546
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,520
hydrated bodies and brains work better

1547
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,440
it's that that

1548
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,599
it's just the thing so yeah while you

1549
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,440
can't turn off an anxiety attack you can

1550
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,640
breathe and you can have a glass of

1551
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,160
water

1552
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,280
it stops helping yeah and

1553
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,000
focus on the breathing

1554
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,400
and consciously drink the water just

1555
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,240
don't plug

1556
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,160
experience it

1557
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,920
experience the sensation of the water in

1558
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,720
your mouth yeah swallowing

1559
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,880
it's a little step because

1560
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,079
getting past the initial

1561
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,720
punch of the anxiety attack once once

1562
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,799
you're through five percent the other 95

1563
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:13,359
is easier

1564
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,839
this slide needs no explanation

1565
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,599
sometimes it's just everything's

1566
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:20,480
happening everything is on fire

1567
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,799
and all you can do is try to stay calm

1568
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,280
and get through it and that especially

1569
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,119
applies when you're in a security

1570
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:29,119
situation and everything feels like it's

1571
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,640
on fire

1572
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,240
and

1573
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,680
really in the worst case scenario you

1574
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,119
lose a client you lose a job you're

1575
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,160
still you and you're fine

1576
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,359
it's a weird picture this one

1577
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:46,880
well fortunately i've got terrible

1578
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,160
vision yeah

1579
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,079
i can't even really see it

1580
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,920
it's the same blur that they've all been

1581
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,319
yeah um so you'll have to talk to this

1582
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,960
slide yeah but basically

1583
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,359
anxiety can make things

1584
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:02,240
on the out would seem like it's all

1585
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,240
normal like you might look like you're

1586
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,799
doing absolutely fine but inside you

1587
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:07,599
you're

1588
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,720
not having a great time and

1589
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,760
it's kind of hard to see that from

1590
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,200
the external

1591
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
and part of that is just working out

1592
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,599
that hey that person's not

1593
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:22,319
quite the same as normal and maybe ask

1594
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,319
them how they are

1595
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,079
checking in just understanding that

1596
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,480
people might not be how they seem from

1597
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,119
the outside

1598
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,960
and sometimes there might be more one

1599
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,319
issue

1600
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,880
yeah we are complex systems all of us

1601
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,960
and

1602
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,760
yeah

1603
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,440
nana died and you're feeling sad about

1604
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,200
that but it also reminds you of your own

1605
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,680
mortality and your own mortality reminds

1606
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,880
you the kid in second grade who died and

1607
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,760
we are complex systems and you can have

1608
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,839
cascade failures if anybody remembers

1609
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:56,799
cascade failures

1610
00:57:57,839 --> 00:57:59,839
it's seldom just one thing

1611
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,760
we're all under time pressure we're all

1612
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,920
under money pressure we all

1613
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,160
either have landlords or mortgages one

1614
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,359
of the two

1615
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,760
and both of those are pressure points

1616
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,599
we have complex systems oppressing us

1617
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:14,319
and

1618
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:17,839
we have to juggle to cue them

1619
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,040
to deal with which one is causing the

1620
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,040
most stress and trying to manage that

1621
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:25,920
stress and it's just

1622
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,480
modern life sorry don't know how to

1623
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,680
solve all of it she'll be right

1624
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,200
yeah so

1625
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,200
turns out this is an australian thing

1626
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,040
i've always thought it was new zealand i

1627
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,640
guess it's just another thing they've

1628
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,480
stolen she won't be right some things

1629
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,880
don't fix themselves

1630
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,640
sometimes you need to actually put an

1631
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,760
effort and

1632
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,599
sometimes you need to see a third

1633
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,680
direction in your life sometimes you

1634
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,920
need to find the way to talk to another

1635
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,559
human being

1636
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,119
sometimes complex problems are complex

1637
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,400
and

1638
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,290
you have the right tool set for

1639
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,680
[Music]

1640
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,839
solving an mx record failure but you may

1641
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:06,160
not have the right toolset for solving

1642
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,440
your

1643
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,880
chronic insecurity about x y or is that

1644
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,680
and seeing professionals is a good thing

1645
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,839
to i have a greatest advantage coming

1646
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,079
from california because we really regard

1647
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,760
seeing a psychologist like seeing a

1648
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,079
 dentist my two-thirds i'm going

1649
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,920
to see the dentist my brain's not

1650
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,040
working right i'm going to go see a

1651
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,520
therapist and there's nothing no value

1652
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,040
judgment to it there's a lot of value

1653
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,599
judgment to it here or so i have heard

1654
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,520
yeah there's also a stigma quality

1655
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:36,079
therapists here can be challenging

1656
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,160
so if you do go see a therapist and

1657
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,240
you're feeling like it's not good

1658
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,960
fire the therapist

1659
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,359
you know you you may have to go through

1660
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,200
two or three therapists to find one that

1661
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,160
works for you and if you

1662
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,480
get to the third one and you're still

1663
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,240
not finding it right the only thing that

1664
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,079
three therapists have in common is you

1665
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,799
yes um last question sorry we've

1666
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,079
actually had this talk going for more

1667
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,520
than 90 minutes which is absolutely

1668
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,000
awesome we wanted to give this you know

1669
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,240
so much time to talk about this but um

1670
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,119
really 90 minutes we've got 60 60

1671
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,240
minutes

1672
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,760
we started at 4 20. wow

1673
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,400
and nobody was smoking

1674
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,079
so you've got to slide up here on where

1675
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,319
to get help personally

1676
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,680
but what about companies that want to

1677
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,000
