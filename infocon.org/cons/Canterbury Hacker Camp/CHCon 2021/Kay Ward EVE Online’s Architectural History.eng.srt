1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,770
[Applause]

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,559
all right thank you everybody

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,759
it's good to be back up here again

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,600
and hello to everybody watching online

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,279
as well

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,680
today's talk is about eve online's

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,199
architecture

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,880
its networking and how it's changed

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,960
throughout the years

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,920
just start off with a quick apology um

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,599
there's pretty bullet point heavy talk

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
and uh i'm sorry for that

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,440
uh who am i um i am k ward at kzone on

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,079
twitter my pronouns are they them if my

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,840
parents are watching uh surprise

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,800
i study compsci at uc

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,920
i am a quote unquote biohacker if you

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,440
saw my talk last year you'll know about

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,480
that

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
and i'm also a bad electric skateboard

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
builder more recently

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
if you want advice on that don't ask me

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,440
and i'm a rocketry hobbyist so i've been

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,920
building rockets in my last few months

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
and i designed avionics for those

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
rockets

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,119
over here on the right you can see a

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,119
successful landing

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,479
even a crash landing as a landing

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,320
what is eve online

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,439
it's a science fiction mmo rpg video

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,600
game which is a lot of words

33
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
it's space based

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
and it's highly open world and it's

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,000
basically a gigantic sandbox so they

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,680
have a lot of

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,439
trading

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,520
mining combat

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,240
piracy there's essentially no rules

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
and it's also uniquely designed in a lot

41
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,840
of ways that i'll talk about in a bit

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,280
later

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,520
it's also an endless headline generator

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,000
it's the gaming press's favorite game

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,040
generally uh here's a couple from ign

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
uh how eve online's players of the wall

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,159
it costs seven hundred thousand dollars

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,399
and eve online breaks its own guinness

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,159
world record for the costliest video

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,000
game battle in history

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,079
i can't really convert from game money

52
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,600
to real money but

53
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
makes a good headline

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,199
this is also it's also called a

55
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,959
spreadsheet simulator

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
this is one of my spreadsheets from a

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,239
couple years ago

58
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
uh calculating profit if i were to buy

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,840
something ship it elsewhere and sell it

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,640
it's a very enthralling video game

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
but why is it unique

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,599
a typical mmo is many separate servers

63
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,160
on many different data centers

64
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
and it's a thing called instanced so you

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
have zones in the game world that are

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,000
let's say a town if you're playing wow

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,160
or something like that and you'll have

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,120
many copies of that town with only say

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
max 100 players or something in each one

70
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
to spread out the load so you don't have

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,879
10 million people trying to jump into

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,080
one area it's also relatively low

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,920
population per instance

74
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,720
eve online is a bit different

75
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,040
it's one server per solar system so

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,840
that's a zone there's only one

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
there's one data center there's also

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
technically others for the chinese

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,159
market and

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
there's test servers as well

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
there's no instancing whatsoever so

82
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
you can have as many people as you want

83
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,599
in

84
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,400
one solar system theoretically doesn't

85
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
really work as well um as we'll come to

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,959
see

87
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,200
and so what what's what's interesting

88
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,840
about that it's just a video game

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,000
well let's start from where it came out

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
this is what the game looked like in

91
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,280
2003 when it was released uh by ccp

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,040
games over in iceland

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
it was built around stackless python

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,239
which is a variant of c python that

95
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,959
removes the c stack

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,799
and also introduces a lot of features

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,000
like micro threading or tasklets

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
and some tasks are handled by native

99
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,720
code rather than python like rendering

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,799
or just getting in packets from the

101
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,080
network

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
it's been constantly expanded and

103
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,680
say two expansions every year to every

104
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,720
quarter

105
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,959
more recently

106
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,640
this is a diagram of the main cluster

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,358
that is referred to as tranquility

108
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,959
so you can see in the dotted line are

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
where clients connect to and they

110
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,639
connect to a proxy server which

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,800
keeps track of who is in what solar

112
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,160
system and routes them to

113
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,320
the main servers i handle the game logic

114
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,479
for that which called the soul servers

115
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,440
and those are every zone or solar system

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,199
is one of those and we refer to them as

117
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,040
a node and they talk with the sql server

118
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,520
so the sol is one solar system

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,199
um a high load

120
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,520
node might get an entire server to

121
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,639
itself

122
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,120
um whereas usually most of them are

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
chucked on maybe a dozen on one server

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,720
it's mostly handles python game logic

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
like who's shooting at who what's in

126
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,720
your inventory stuff like that

127
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
some critical tasks like physics are

128
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
done natively but

129
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,000
in the beginning that was about all it

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,280
was

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
and more tasks have been offloaded as

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
time goes on and more people have gone

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,440
into the game

134
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,800
sql server is a little interesting

135
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,479
it's one database for the entire

136
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,840
universe

137
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
it's ms sql and it's being constantly

138
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,039
thrashed read and write by

139
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
let's say it's 30 000 people active

140
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
these days

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,479
and there's a whole lot of stake to keep

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,240
track of what's in your inventory what

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
skills do you have things like that

144
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,479
some stats over there from 2010 it's a

145
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,680
total 1.4 terabyte database

146
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,240
2500 transactions per second and

147
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,840
175 million database calls per day

148
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
and this is what the client looked like

149
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,360
when it first came out version 1000

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,840
it was on stack list 2.2

151
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,240
so a little bit old

152
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,840
it was rendering physics were just

153
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
native code nothing else

154
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
um there was no protection on the python

155
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
byte code so it just came as a blob of

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
by code that you could just chuck in a

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,440
decompiler and just get everything back

158
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,759
i was plain tcp to the server no

159
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,039
encryption no compression initially

160
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,039
and some

161
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,440
very interesting programming in there

162
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,000
interesting comments like uh this error

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
message in the error log

164
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
playing chicken with a freight train a

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,440
sorry dude but the show must go on

166
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,120
i don't know what that actually means

167
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,639
there's another one

168
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,759
something uh word with default exception

169
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,280
handling

170
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
and this function

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,639
uber fn macho remote service call

172
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,639
i've been working with this client off

173
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,720
and on for like three years i don't know

174
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
what that function does still i have no

175
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,000
clue

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,080
but it is part of something called macho

177
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,560
net which is their massive networking

178
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,199
and rpc library they developed in-house

179
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,720
just for this game

180
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
um it induced packets from the

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
native code like low-level handler they

182
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,960
called net client

183
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,479
and it caches python objects that

184
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,720
don't change very often

185
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
and it calls server-side services and

186
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,599
gets data back like the market inventory

187
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,160
handling things like that

188
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,440
and there's also a relatively large

189
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,280
amount of overhead on it especially with

190
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
things like chat messages where

191
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,000
you might send a message as just hi or

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
something like that and it's a 70 byte

193
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,280
call to the server

194
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,280
and there's been quite a lot of changes

195
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,960
throughout the year

196
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,360
this screenshot is from trinity which is

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,080
around 2010 i think when they introduced

198
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,240
the new renderer and they've replaced it

199
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,919
multiple times

200
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,599
i think we're up to the third now it's

201
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,319
just been incrementally changed um

202
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,840
they've introduced packet encryption

203
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
around 2006 as well as compression

204
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,280
i think that was part of their chinese

205
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,800
market push

206
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,599
i think there may have been a

207
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,199
requirement

208
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,039
major content expansions the whole time

209
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
they've just increased the complexity of

210
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,960
the whole thing

211
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
introduce something called time dilation

212
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,400
which we'll come back to later try

213
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,479
handle some of the load

214
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,240
and optimizing around the global

215
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,039
interpreter lock which we'll get to now

216
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,720
this is a quote from the eve

217
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,599
devblog uh hereafter known as the damn

218
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,919
stink and gill or just gil for short

219
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,880
it's the global interpreter lock and on

220
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,559
the right here you can see a diagram of

221
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,479
how that works where

222
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,479
you can have many micro threads with

223
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
stack lists but they can only execute

224
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,279
one in a row they have to acquire the

225
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,560
girl

226
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
run code and then release it and then

227
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
something else can run

228
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
it's great for threading but that does

229
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,399
become a significant problem and it's

230
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,560
been extremely problematic for eve over

231
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,839
the years when you have 30 000 people

232
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,240
constantly updating a lot of state

233
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
and yeah

234
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,440
there's been quite a large investment in

235
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
trying to sign step it can't really

236
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,959
remove it there's a few projects that

237
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,640
are working on that but it hasn't really

238
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,720
panned out yet

239
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,360
so they've tried to kill it as best they

240
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,680
can

241
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120
one approach

242
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,959
at least to reduce load was time

243
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,399
dilation

244
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,720
which players refer to as tie-dye and it

245
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
artificially slows down all of your

246
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,640
actions so say you're trying to fire a

247
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
weapon at somebody

248
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
normally it might take five seconds to

249
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
reload it will take 50 50 seconds 25

250
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,920
depends on the load of the server

251
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
it's not really enjoyed by most players

252
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,839
it doesn't doesn't make for a great

253
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,560
experience that's the dreaded symbol up

254
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,399
there that means 50

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
time dilation so every action takes 50

256
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,160
longer

257
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,680
so the big fleet battles that are in

258
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,080
headlines will be

259
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
down to 10

260
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,040
of normal speed

261
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
it's a bit of a band-aid fix it reduces

262
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,640
load but it makes the experience pretty

263
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,959
terrible

264
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,480
one of the first things they did to try

265
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,720
work around the gill was a project

266
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,360
called stackless io which was introduced

267
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,720
in 2008 and it offloads all the basic

268
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,399
tasks of networking

269
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,959
uh to a native code thread to

270
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,600
ingest the packet and do very basic

271
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
handling of it there's a diagram up

272
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,120
there of how python will request the

273
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,519
packet continue running while that

274
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,040
thread completes the request and

275
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
notifies

276
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
it sidesteps the girl but it's not

277
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,320
immune to it

278
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,399
and there's another thing they did a

279
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,800
little later on called carbon io

280
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
to try work around that a bit more it

281
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,120
was in 2011

282
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
and it takes that a step further by

283
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,880
processing entirely the packet and a

284
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,839
native thread so it'll

285
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,279
decrypt it decompress it and get it

286
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,839
prepared for python

287
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
entirely concurrently with everything

288
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,279
else

289
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,640
and it will accumulate those packets in

290
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,120
a pool um i can see up here

291
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
until python request it

292
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
so that speeded up networking quite a

293
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,680
bit and it was entirely outside the gill

294
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,519
and it was part of a project called blue

295
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,680
net which is still running i believe is

296
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,519
slowly offloading

297
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,600
more and more things that

298
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,519
macho net traditionally did in python

299
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
like remote service calls trying to

300
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,120
shift them over to

301
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,560
native code that can be done

302
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,720
concurrently

303
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,760
it did reduce load quite a bit this is a

304
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,560
graph of percentage cpu per user on a

305
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,079
node in blue is stackless io and in red

306
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,640
is carbon io i don't have

307
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,240
one for before either of those were

308
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,600
introduced but it would have been pretty

309
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,880
terrible

310
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,240
so it reduced the load quite a bit

311
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,680
i don't want to talk about another thing

312
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,880
related to carbon which is dust 514 it

313
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
was a

314
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,639
fps in the same universe as eve online

315
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,680
same setting but it also connected to

316
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,959
tranquility

317
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,240
so

318
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,959
you could for example an eve bombard a

319
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,360
planet from a spaceship and it would

320
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,560
show up in a battle in dust

321
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,839
and that would have been impossible

322
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,760
without their without them developing

323
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,519
carbon and carbon io which is their

324
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,720
framework for more real-time games

325
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,279
like a first-person shooter

326
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,200
and it ran from 2013 to 2016 uh may it

327
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
rest in peace

328
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,279
but there is a project trying to bring

329
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
it back that i wanted to shout out real

330
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,200
quick which is dust mu

331
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,880
they're working to

332
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,040
get the game up and running again on a

333
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,920
ps3 emulator

334
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,279
there are quite a few people who i've

335
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
spoken to who are very sad about the

336
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,839
game being shut down so

337
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,079
yeah and also oh

338
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
i just lost the bike oh there we go um

339
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,120
and there's also evmu which was

340
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,760
well is sort of it's been

341
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,720
on and off development since about 2006

342
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,200
it's a project to

343
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,760
re-implement the eve service stack in a

344
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,279
basic monolithic blob of c-plus plus

345
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,360
and it's been a very good reference and

346
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
it's still being worked on

347
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,160
there's also eve sharp which is aiming

348
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,800
to replicate the cluster architecture

349
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
originally

350
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,760
in c sharp

351
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,279
and yeah i know the guy that's working

352
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,000
on that is a great date

353
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
to summarize

354
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,240
eve is rather unique in the mmo space

355
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,279
obviously

356
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,680
i am not aware of any other

357
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,480
mmo with this kind of population that

358
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,760
does no sharding whatsoever

359
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,320
and ccp games tends to keep kind of

360
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,399
quiet about how their architecture does

361
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,279
work

362
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,839
most of this was scraped together from

363
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,399
dev blogs and

364
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,959
slide shows from 2005 that probably

365
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,000
shouldn't have been on the internet

366
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,040
so there

367
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,440
i do apologize for being a little detail

368
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
light but it is kind of hard to find

369
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
very in-depth stuff on this

370
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,760
um and they've sunk a huge investment

371
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
into sidestepping the gill

372
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,880
there is a project

373
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,959
that started up recently like has

374
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,680
managed to entirely rip the gill out of

375
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,399
python 3 but i'm not sure how stable

376
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,839
that is i don't think it'll be

377
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,079
picked up by any production companies

378
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,320
anytime soon

379
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,560
and it also shows the decisions that you

380
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,959
make decades ago can kind of haunt you

381
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:36,959
um the whole architecture was perfectly

382
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,839
fine with stackless python back in 2003

383
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,160
where they maybe had max

384
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,199
50 players or something in one system

385
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,360
but now it's grown to massive fleet

386
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
fights of

387
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,839
4 000 or more people and all the servers

388
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,240
are really straining under the load

389
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,720
um and i think that'll be all for me now
