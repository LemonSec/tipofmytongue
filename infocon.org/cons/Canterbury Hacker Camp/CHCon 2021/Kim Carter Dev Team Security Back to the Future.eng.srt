1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,720
um yeah so um

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,240
before i get into this i just want to um

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
thank the organizers uh for basically

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,480
organizing several cons right

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,519
so they've had a whole lot of

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,840
contingencies and stuff um

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,920
due to covert and that sort of thing

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,080
uh yeah so

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,400
i mean i was i was on board a while ago

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,320
and i'm organizing one conference was

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,840
hard enough but

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,519
organizing all the contingencies and

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,279
stuff like that

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,880
just would have been

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,559
for me it would have been a nightmare so

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,559
um

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,399
can we just put our hands together for

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,559
the organizers

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,039
right

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,559
so we're going to be looking at the past

21
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,239
present and future

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,680
um of of basically standards and

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,800
and

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,840
and where i think um are we going

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,920
uh for basically um

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,239
our developers their teams um

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,400
stakeholders sea levels and that sort of

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,280
thing

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
so i'm just going to start off with um

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
two people types that i'm going to take

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
through

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,680
a good part of the talk

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,080
uh so yeah so two people types there's a

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
mainstream category which targets less

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,920
technical folk that's like your

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
stakeholders your managers

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,759
basically anyone that isn't uh doing

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,240
info sec as a job

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,159
and of course developers

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,000
and then this type two which uh

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
basically you're in for six well yeah

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,759
you are your information security

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,759
professionals which are doing it as a

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,320
day job

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,960
okay

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
so how do we use to measure the security

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,200
maturity of the software that our

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,159
development teams produced

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,320
so as you can see there's a lot of

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
up there's a lot of stuff there right

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,000
um and that's that's the problem

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360
uh

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,280
so there's lots of docs to read lots of

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,600
standards to attempt to adhere to

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,878
and it was super confusing and still is

56
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,360
if you're trying to do it this way

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
so i'm just going to walk through some

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,720
of these docs um now to um

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,720
for you

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,200
for those that haven't uh seen these so

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
they are the application security

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,920
verification standard

63
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,080
and they're all pretty long

64
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,080
so

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
looking at like what

66
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,080
what 70 pages here 70 pages and most of

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
these are sort of like a similar sort of

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,319
length

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000
so basically it's a

70
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,080
it's just a lot of stuff like a lot of

71
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,000
stuff to get your heads around

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,120
um checklists

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
and really stuff that's targeted at type

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
2

75
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,840
people

76
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,440
so the software assurance maturity model

77
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,239
a little bit shorter

78
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,680
these docks are all great for type 2

79
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,720
people

80
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,879
but for type 1 and for people just

81
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,200
entering the um security field and that

82
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,280
it's it's it's just a mental overload

83
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,159
now the um

84
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,439
this guy's a bit shorter than the rest

85
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,160
but this is um predominantly just uh our

86
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,680
checklists all the way through right

87
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,840
okay so the uh

88
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,240
approximately 75 cheat sheets that oh

89
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,639
wasp

90
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,360
that the cheat sheets project has given

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,360
us

92
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,120
and yeah there's a lot of good stuff in

93
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,360
there

94
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,280
but if

95
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,120
but if this is your first foray into um

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
basically getting security into your

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,919
project

98
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,520
or trying to adopt security into your

99
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
business or you know um you're not an

100
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,720
infosec

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,880
a pro then this sort of stuff's really

102
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
quite intimidating

103
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,800
uh the various top 10 lists so i've got

104
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,479
the um

105
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,160
the web top 10 the mobile top 10 the iot

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
i think there's one or two others as

107
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,199
well

108
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,880
um so i'm just going to

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
get rid of some of these the sends top

110
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
25

111
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,320
in the mitre type 25

112
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,560
okay so a list of 25 um what you'll see

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,840
is

114
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,600
there's quite a few similarities between

115
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
these two

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
for example there's some cross

117
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,199
pollination there was one there uh yeah

118
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,880
119

119
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,840
i think

120
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,560
was

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,600
it placed like it placed 17 or something

122
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,280
yeah

123
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,680
yeah down here so you've got lists right

124
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,919
well okay so we've got two lists here as

125
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,759
a newcomer you're looking at that

126
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,199
and trying to prioritize you're trying

127
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,800
to fit model

128
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,639
so okay on one

129
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,160
hand it's number one and on the other

130
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
one it's

131
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,479
17 places down the list so it's not that

132
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
important so how important is it right

133
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,840
so there's all this sort of stuff

134
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,479
happening right

135
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,400
you've got the cisq code quality rules

136
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,120
in fact csq has got a lot of great

137
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,600
content

138
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,560
but if you're a developer or you know a

139
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,319
manager or anyone that's sort of

140
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,240
organizing a development related stuff

141
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,000
and you're coming into this

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,520
it's it's it's mental overload

143
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,880
and of course assist controls most well

144
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,319
yeah a lot of us here are familiar with

145
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,199
those great content but

146
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
just just too much and too complex

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,800
for

148
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,400
for type one people

149
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,520
so scary stuff yeah

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,599
so

151
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,080
so there's been a lot of manual work

152
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,560
i'm sure we had lots of tools

153
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
but most of them we had to drive them

154
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,599
manually

155
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,720
and it felt like we weren't really

156
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,960
getting anywhere

157
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
so going to the prison

158
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,520
so many of us are still trying to hold

159
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,400
on to the past

160
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,879
that's this

161
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,599
or at least don't yet understand that

162
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,319
there's a better way

163
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,319
so there's been significant improvements

164
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,360
in the information and tooling

165
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,440
available recently like as in the last

166
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
few months

167
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
there's some new standards that are

168
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,599
starting to emerge and that are starting

169
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,800
to reflect this as well

170
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,400
security documentation is starting to

171
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,599
grow up

172
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,919
and we have this newcomer the nist

173
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,919
almost standard

174
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
so nist's trying to make a simpler

175
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,320
smaller more achievable standard

176
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,559
that can be understood by both types of

177
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
people but it's specifically targeted at

178
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,839
type 1 people

179
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,120
it's prescriptive it's less intimidating

180
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,279
it's measurable and it's concise

181
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,519
but it's not technically a standard yet

182
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,480
so let's have a look at it

183
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,000
and the accompanying dock

184
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,560
so there's

185
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,720
there's 12 technique classes they call

186
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,000
them here oh sorry um 12 techniques

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,560
that's this row here

188
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
and you've got a few technique classes

189
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,800
there

190
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,839
right so that looking at that looks

191
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,040
really simple right looks like there's

192
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,360
not actually a lot there

193
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,680
and there

194
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,880
isn't if we have a look at the actual

195
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,680
accompanying dock

196
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
page four

197
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,160
here's our abstract

198
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
okay i can't see that there

199
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,320
um

200
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,680
so there was an executive order

201
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,880
to improve the nation's cyber security

202
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,519
which directed the nist to recommend a

203
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,519
minimum set of standards for software

204
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,320
testing within 60 days

205
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,640
so this document describes 11 although

206
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,959
it's 12 with the last one being fix your

207
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,720
bugs

208
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,720
um

209
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
yeah that describes 12 recommendations

210
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
for software verification techniques as

211
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
well as providing supplemental

212
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,160
information and blah blah blah so

213
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,880
there's 11 points there and that's your

214
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240
11 points plus your fix your stuff

215
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,959
which is number 12.

216
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
so we have a look at the contents

217
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,880
well there's not much there really

218
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,399
you've got all the supplemental material

219
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,040
which is again still not a lot there

220
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,320
and you've got these points here so

221
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,000
so threat modeling you've got like what

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
two paragraphs

223
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,040
and

224
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
automated testing

225
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,680
yeah

226
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
a couple of paragraphs

227
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,800
each one of these is super short and

228
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,560
just just really easy to digest

229
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,120
and there's a good reason for that

230
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,959
so

231
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,800
i've taken the table from the new nist

232
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
standard and extended it to include a

233
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,040
tools column

234
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,079
cool

235
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,519
so that's our next standard there

236
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,480
basically

237
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,959
and we've got

238
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
some tools there

239
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
so these are basically

240
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
some tools i added on that i i consider

241
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,680
to be best of breed

242
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,399
that basically satisfy

243
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,560
what's required in those 12 techniques

244
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,959
so besides the threat modeling so i've

245
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,200
got three blue lines there

246
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,800
besides the first line which is threat

247
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,120
modeling material evil test conditions

248
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,200
this line here

249
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,120
and fuzzing

250
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,639
the rest of these tools lend themselves

251
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,959
really well to being automated

252
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
and added to your editor's ides and

253
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,839
build pipelines

254
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,920
so an area of tooling that automatically

255
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,360
does what

256
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,240
most of what we used to do manually so

257
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,200
our tooling's starting to mature right

258
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
so

259
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,880
yeah just a bit of uh so we've got oh

260
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
sweet modding cheat sheets and we've got

261
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,519
uh so so this is a book series that i

262
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,600
wrote it's available free online uh

263
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,399
holistic infosec for web developers

264
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,560
um it's available free online to read i

265
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,320
did a proof of concept in there which

266
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,440
ended up um turning into a fully fledged

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
project which is i was purple team

268
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,120
bit of a disclaimer there uh evil test

269
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
conditions is also in holistic invasive

270
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,440
web developers the rest of these tools

271
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
uh

272
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
yeah are like i said what i would

273
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,120
consider to be best of breed

274
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,279
and as cheap as possible that i could

275
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
find or free

276
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,880
which is

277
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,680
even better right

278
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,319
okay so let's look to the future

279
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,120
oh no not their futures achieved

280
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,079
oh no not that one

281
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,279
ah yeah that's better

282
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,480
okay so i believe for type one people

283
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,160
we were going as a mix of the nist type

284
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
standard with most of the detail being

285
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,760
taken care of by automated tooling

286
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,720
this is all part of infosec

287
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,560
commoditization and the evolution right

288
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,320
so

289
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,839
so the way i see this happening and it

290
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,639
is happening already is that the tooling

291
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,720
is starting to basically teach

292
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,639
those type one people so we've got the

293
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,079
type two people that are creating the

294
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,279
tools and the type one now rather than

295
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,240
going through

296
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,560
just multitudes of docs and standards

297
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,839
and

298
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
trying to navigate an insane amount of

299
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,000
information

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
basically if you um

301
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,040
take the likes of that nist standard

302
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,600
take those tools or similar tools

303
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,959
and um throw them into your ides and um

304
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,959
your build pipelines

305
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,720
and that sort of thing

306
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
basically get them automated those tools

307
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,279
will start to teach

308
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,079
you or a type 1 people i'm about

309
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,920
security as you're going

310
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
so yeah it's it's

311
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,880
it's no longer a mental overload

312
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,199
yeah so as developers you can expect to

313
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,040
see the level of technical detail

314
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,199
lifting so as to focus on more abstract

315
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,199
topics and activities

316
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,440
such as verification as opposed to the

317
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,040
hands-on testing that we've done in the

318
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
past

319
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,839
standards are going to continue to

320
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,000
become higher level and the tool chains

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,160
will continue to increase their support

322
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,480
of them

323
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,320
so

324
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,040
yeah i can see all yawning

325
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,000
relax

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,720
you've got this type 1 people

327
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,680
there's no need to stress

328
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,160
with the new runtime application

329
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,399
self-protection type tooling as well

330
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,800
rasp just another acronym for you

331
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,720
so we've got the likes of uh screen

332
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
h div and some others

333
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,639
uh your application your applications

334
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,600
can now start to defend themselves

335
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
without are you writing additional code

336
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,560
so i'm just going to give you a quick

337
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,519
look at the

338
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,920
screen docs

339
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
okay so with screen you basically

340
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,079
consume a library

341
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,959
they target a few different languages

342
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,360
uh so you consume a library um as a

343
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,120
dependency of your application or

344
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,839
service or whatever it is you're writing

345
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,839
uh you've got a micro agent

346
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,680
in that library that sits within your

347
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,079
running code and it communicates with

348
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,440
the cloud-based screen platform

349
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,519
and it applies dynamic instrumentation

350
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
to points of the app's code so

351
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,560
it's so it's like aspects of

352
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,079
aspect-oriented programming

353
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,759
it monitors your application at each

354
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,279
instrumentation point

355
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,360
and performs security responses as

356
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,199
directed by the security engine

357
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,479
that resides within the microagent

358
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,439
so big thanks to the star of the talk

359
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,359
max

360
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,039
ah this is my uh

361
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,439
cat my main queen cat he's

362
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
this is this is where he normally sits

363
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,079
when i'm working

364
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,240
and of course you for listening to me

365
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,559
ramble

366
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,559
seriously

367
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,240
[Laughter]

368
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,039
okay um so as i mentioned uh purple

369
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,200
teams is a project i've been working on

370
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,120
it's at about 3.8 years now um it's it's

371
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,440
it's starting to come to maturity this

372
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
is a shirt

373
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,960
as you can see

374
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
if you want one

375
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,280
then answer this question correctly

376
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,520
how many techniques are there in the new

377
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,320
nist standard

378
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
who said that

379
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,240
yep

380
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
no you're right

381
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,240
but can you get the bonus

382
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,240
how much of the technique

383
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,360
classes had the most techniques

384
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,720
it's a guy i'll go back to it

385
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,000
uh actually it's up here isn't it

386
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,440
dynamic analysis

387
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
cool so

388
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,679
i'll give you a i'll um

389
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,840
get someone to take it to you

390
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,840
soon

391
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,799
yep that's it that's my talk

392
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,399
you
