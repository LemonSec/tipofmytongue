1
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,480
thank you very much um

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
sorry i can't be there in person with

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,200
you everybody i was um i can see a

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,560
camera view which is really nice i

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,880
almost went and made a cardboard cutout

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,840
audience

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,080
so i can you know complete with

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,519
you know different

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,400
groups that are usually usually here

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,080
or then i just thought maybe potatoes

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,960
with

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
with uh toothpicks almost made that

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,079
diorama but i didn't have to luckily

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,200
because there's a camera set up

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
technology these days

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,360
um well so yeah thanks for coming to my

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,320
talk sas security is a second thought um

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,719
i must admit i came up with the title uh

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,640
first and had quite a few chuckles to

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
myself as i like to do a big fan of puns

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,840
and alliteration

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,879
but i wasn't really sure what the stock

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,800
was going to be right that moment

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,559
there's lots of thoughts i have floating

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,480
around about this topic for the last few

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,280
years

27
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,840
and and so it could be sas you know

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,920
you're building a sas company or sas

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,080
you've got lots of services in your

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,320
company that's a bit of both but

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,799
focusing a little bit on the latter

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,320
so

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,000
really this i want to start with the

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
statement here that remember to build a

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,159
secure company

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,320
not just a secure product

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
um you know startups and sas companies

38
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,000
are often big big uh you know

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,920
offenders here of building focusing on

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,360
the secure product you know they're very

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
technical you've got all of the

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
people are very technically involved

43
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,240
right through to the end uh you know

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,000
right ctos might still be technically

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
involved and then everyone thinks they

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,759
know how to build a secure product uh

47
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,439
and often secure companies kind of left

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,560
out a little bit

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,399
i was so i'm not talking about

50
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,000
how startups should do things they have

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
enough problems even coming up with the

52
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,680
product and making that secure so uh you

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,360
know you guys keep doing that awesome

54
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,280
stuff but once you get a bit bigger and

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
you've hired some people you've got some

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
money you're underway you can start

57
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,840
breathing again

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,280
uh you know it's really good time just

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,439
look back and look at the pile of

60
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,360
services that you've left behind you

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,719
know

62
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,079
sort of really sitting on top of this

63
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,960
huge pile i like the imagery there of a

64
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,758
pile of sass like a big dirty pile of

65
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,920
laundry you know not that i think

66
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
there's anything wrong with sass you

67
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
know you can it's really useful and

68
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,879
probably wherever every company's gonna

69
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,080
be heading

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,959
but

71
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,120
yeah it's something that we associate

72
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
with the more you have kind of the

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,800
bigger the problem is right

74
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
um the average company now actually has

75
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,160
about 50 to 100 sas services probably

76
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,599
don't quote me on that i did lots of

77
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
different searches and they all come

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,239
with different answers but it's around

79
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,160
that range and it's only going to be

80
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,319
getting more and more

81
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,920
i used to do some security awareness

82
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,239
training and every time i'd write the

83
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,080
beginning i'd ask people tell me all of

84
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
your sas services that you're using

85
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,200
and you get the best responses from the

86
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,280
most varied group of people right you

87
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,879
have like finance team giving you all

88
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
their services that they use and that's

89
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,160
going to be completely different picture

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,200
to you know marketing to engineering

91
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,879
so you really got to ask everyone in

92
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,000
your company

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,920
these kinds of things not just think

94
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,480
that engineering knows best you know

95
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
i'm often guilty of that

96
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,519
um yeah where are you getting the

97
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,000
services from um even are you still

98
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,519
telling your employees to go out and buy

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,120
whatever laptop they want and they come

100
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
back with the latest rgb gaming thing

101
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,959
and whatever operating system they feel

102
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,200
like and they've installed all of the

103
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
tools npm installed the world and

104
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
they're running root amazon credentials

105
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120
you know at some point you're you're

106
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,959
going to fall over with that secure

107
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,159
company part

108
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,480
even if your product's really great it's

109
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
all based on a bit of anecdotal

110
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,280
experience but hopefully there's some

111
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,519
relatable pieces in here for you and the

112
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,360
the places you work if not just a

113
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,519
chuckle

114
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,280
so yeah what are the first set steps

115
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
here well take inventory of your sass

116
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
you know it's pretty easy you go and

117
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
just you know write them all down uh it

118
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,280
can be hard if you don't actually talk

119
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
to the right people so think you know

120
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
keep that in mind we're going to

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,120
classify some data um what are the sas

122
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,159
what are you putting in these sas

123
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,599
companies

124
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,040
you know maybe we can think about some

125
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
risks associated with that

126
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,640
and then even consider some controls i

127
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,720
see these are big big security terms

128
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,120
that i normally find boring but i've

129
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,480
come to love these things because this

130
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,840
kind of underpins everything i found

131
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,200
um the real piece though is that you're

132
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
going to be able to communicate

133
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,639
and

134
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,320
how else can you empower everyone to

135
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,479
make great security decisions if you

136
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,240
know they don't have the accurate

137
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
reliable information sitting in front of

138
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
them that's

139
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
in the context of the work that they do

140
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,120
if they do then they can make the

141
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,600
decisions themselves and it's it's

142
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
that's how you're going to scale in in

143
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,160
your security posture

144
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,680
so of course to solve this problem i'm

145
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,320
introducing a new sas product

146
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,160
just kidding um really what i've got is

147
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
just 99 neo4j which is a graph database

148
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
uh because it happens to solve a big

149
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,320
part of my problem here

150
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
and a little bit of open policy agent

151
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
which is quite interesting and we'll get

152
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,400
to at the end

153
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,720
i had to fight very hard not to register

154
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
a domain name and come up with a name

155
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,479
and print t-shirts for this one

156
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,840
because i keep getting but what

157
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
convinced me is my email reminders that

158
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,520
my

159
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,600
last year's random domain names are

160
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,080
expiring and i just let them go these

161
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,680
days you know

162
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,199
yeah it's pretty sad so these days i

163
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
just not even create them

164
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,759
so

165
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,240
that first piece take inventory uh let's

166
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,280
make a list of all the third party

167
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,199
servers you use um

168
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,960
you know which ones are critical to your

169
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,479
company and how are you defining

170
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,520
critical

171
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
it's probably easy to think about well

172
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,280
if amazon stopped existing then you know

173
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,639
we probably would have a hard time

174
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,639
recovering from that but

175
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,759
how much money do you have to lose

176
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,280
before you consider something critical

177
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,960
or is it loss of customers or is it loss

178
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,720
of a brand reputation i mean think about

179
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
that stuff now and and

180
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,800
think about which services are critical

181
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,880
and for those critical services you know

182
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
how do you contact them

183
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,880
like you've bought you've paid for the

184
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,560
stuff but how do you actually can you

185
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
call someone on the phone as a top tip

186
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,039
you can figure this out before an

187
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,440
incident you know you can find the phone

188
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
number and the contact details before

189
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
you really need it you don't want to be

190
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
like on a friday night i don't know why

191
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
it's always a friday

192
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,479
that you're like trying to contact your

193
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,479
domain registrar and you find out that

194
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,240
they're not available until monday you

195
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,960
know

196
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,479
and even then it's gonna be hard to talk

197
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
to a human you know does your ceo need

198
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,120
to tweet at the ceo of assess product in

199
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
order for you is that your

200
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,479
communications channel you know

201
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,800
figure that out before you need it um

202
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,639
because are you just a 10 a year

203
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,440
customer to your domain registrar

204
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
but their domain is actually your domain

205
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,840
is actually controlling your 100 billion

206
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,120
business um

207
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
interesting questions

208
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,639
who looks after all these services uh

209
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,160
often this is how these lists start you

210
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
know i just want access to stuff so who

211
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
do i ask and i'm sure you've been in a

212
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
situation where you get this list and

213
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,919
you're like okay cool here's the service

214
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,759
i want but this person no longer works

215
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,520
here uh and so you're going to kind of

216
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,960
find out the next person oh well this

217
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,400
person passed it onto this other person

218
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
now i can't you know it's just really

219
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
hard even just to find out a simple

220
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,440
answer like how do i onboard myself

221
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,720
and then the flip side of that is who's

222
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,560
still got access to everything

223
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,599
you know are you still thinking about

224
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,199
who's got access to all your services

225
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,199
which contractor still has a random you

226
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
know login to your mdm suite or maybe

227
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
your amazon instances

228
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,199
just simple questions like this

229
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,280
and one that's often overlooked what are

230
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,960
the business requirements of the sas

231
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
product you know why are we even using

232
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
it

233
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
often this is completely overlooked and

234
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,560
we assume that everything's really

235
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
important but some stuff is not um you

236
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,800
know figure out why use it if you can't

237
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,560
figure out why you use it maybe

238
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,759
you know it's one that we can just

239
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,720
easily get rid of straight away um

240
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
but if you do use it write down why you

241
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
use it so that in the future you know

242
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
what how important it is and what what

243
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,879
kind of business function it's solving

244
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
and that would be really useful this

245
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,319
will be there could be some services

246
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,560
that you instantly think oh no that's a

247
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,919
crappy service i don't want to be using

248
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
that but actually the business value

249
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,759
it's giving your business in particular

250
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,319
is very very high and so it actually can

251
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,800
change your perception of services that

252
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,759
maybe have a bad rep

253
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,560
so i have a quick demo of some inventory

254
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
stuff

255
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,319
so let's have a quick look

256
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,639
i've got this graph database

257
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,280
and i've gone and put in

258
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,759
a whole bunch of services which are

259
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,560
these

260
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
blue nodes and connected them to owners

261
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,440
which are these people and so you can

262
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,879
see that there's like this relationship

263
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,560
there and that's the basics of a graph

264
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
it just it really is just a graph

265
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,479
um but what's interesting is when we

266
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,240
start zooming out and we get a bigger

267
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,519
picture of this

268
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,000
we can start seeing some things that we

269
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
can't normally see about this data like

270
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,080
oh yeah we've got some people there that

271
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,159
are not doing anything but if we ever

272
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,399
found hang on we've got a service over

273
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,959
here that doesn't have an owner

274
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
so that's interesting i want to i want

275
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,760
to check out you know what's that

276
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,360
service that doesn't have an owner go

277
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,560
daddy that's probably going to be quite

278
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,600
important

279
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,279
maybe that's from the

280
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,880
first you know

281
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
first version of our app and the

282
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
developers were just you know throwing

283
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,440
everything they could at it but now

284
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,399
what's that what domains are still there

285
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,839
this is really hard to answer if you're

286
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,600
looking at a list of services to answer

287
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
the question what's not there or what

288
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
doesn't have an owner

289
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
so these kind of big overviews like that

290
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
can be really helpful

291
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,000
and of course you can extend that a bit

292
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,320
and you could say all right well show me

293
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
let me just do this

294
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
show me all of the teams now so i want

295
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
to know which people are in which teams

296
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,279
and again like you're going to get quite

297
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,560
a big mess of stuff pop out um but hang

298
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
on a second we've got this service here

299
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,320
which is owned by two people and now you

300
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
can start seeing oh well the engineering

301
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
team owned it and also it team owns it

302
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,120
just by knowing which people are part of

303
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,640
which teams and which people are this

304
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,120
team so maybe here this one maybe was

305
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,399
brought in by engineering and then now

306
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,080
has been transferred to it or something

307
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,360
so you might want to check that one out

308
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
and update it

309
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,080
so you can really find some really cool

310
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,839
stuff like that

311
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,360
you don't of course have to always be

312
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,200
looking at it in this graph view you

313
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,160
might just want a list of hey what team

314
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,880
has what service and if you can imagine

315
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,880
that this this kind of data will be

316
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,200
feeding some list of services in your

317
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,560
company or things like that it doesn't

318
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,399
actually have i'm not saying we need to

319
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,160
be looking at a graph full time but this

320
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,519
is a different all these different

321
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,560
lenses into this into this starter

322
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,279
and i think we had that example of uh

323
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,680
teams

324
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,440
teams with no services at all so

325
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,200
that's interesting i mean it's probably

326
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
good that the execs don't have any

327
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,320
services they're looking after but uh

328
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
what about product team you know they

329
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,519
probably do have some sas services so

330
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,200
maybe we need to go and talk to them and

331
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
ask them what how they do their work so

332
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
yeah that's what i'm some of the real

333
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
cool insights that we can do at this

334
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
stage

335
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,640
you can dig a bit deeper you can start

336
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,480
looking at your servers your databases

337
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
security groups your infrastructure

338
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,399
stuff open source projects open source

339
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,000
projects are a great one because they're

340
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
often seen as this beautiful repository

341
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,600
of

342
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,240
golden code that is always sanctioned

343
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
and perfectly usable

344
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,800
when really some of the quality can be

345
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,160
quite varied don't get me wrong there's

346
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
some amazing stuff out there

347
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
but there's also some stuff that leaves

348
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,959
some things to be desired uh and often

349
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,160
i've been in a meeting where someone

350
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
said they were worried that it was uh

351
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,680
you know how we're gonna bring on board

352
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
this new service um how are we gonna pay

353
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,079
for it you know because the problems

354
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,880
that people are having are the

355
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,600
procurement part not necessarily the you

356
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
know should we be using it from a risk

357
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
point of view it's more like oh well how

358
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,720
do i even pay for it and if it's open

359
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
source you're like oh sweet easy i'll

360
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
just throw it right in there because i

361
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,160
don't need to pay for that

362
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,720
so i think i've got a little bit of an

363
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,360
infrastructure piece here

364
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,160
let's swap over

365
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,519
how this thing was coming up with these

366
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,519
example companies

367
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,279
uh i spent way too long creating the

368
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,680
structure of the company

369
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,200
so maybe you've got something like this

370
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,000
where you've got some load balancers um

371
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,760
these these ones are all security groups

372
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
and these ones are so load balancer and

373
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,720
you've got

374
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,279
servers here so each each of the colors

375
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,040
kind of maps to a different type of

376
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
thing in your database and now we've got

377
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,959
some relationships which is indicating

378
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,519
the security group configurations

379
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,360
so now this is looking great i've got my

380
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,760
mysql database it's got a security group

381
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,920
the three app servers have access

382
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,200
there's a front-end server which doesn't

383
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,959
have access great and then

384
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,880
maybe i've got some ssh stuff happening

385
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,120
here and i've got some you know

386
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,440
https traffic coming in here

387
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
it's quite a simple example but i did

388
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
create something exactly like this to

389
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
solve a problem where i was i didn't i

390
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,560
legitimately had trouble figuring out

391
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,399
which jump post i have to go through to

392
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,000
get to this host because it's a bunch of

393
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,760
different environments and as soon as i

394
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,920
graphed it out we found you know all

395
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
these hosts had this relationship to

396
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
this one security group and it was uh

397
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
you know misconfigured and allowing too

398
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,240
much access so yeah it's very cool to

399
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,279
visualize it so let's imagine we um

400
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,600
introduce a bit of a problem here

401
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,320
we'll just throw in

402
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,680
a relationship that really shouldn't be

403
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,839
there

404
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
so yeah this of course you'd be querying

405
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
the stuff from from your amazon api or

406
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
something and automatically throwing it

407
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,360
in here so again now we've got this

408
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
database sitting back here we've got our

409
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,600
load balancers and things but hang on

410
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,760
this this is there's this relationship

411
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,279
now from our public

412
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,360
piece straight to our database with you

413
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,519
know ssh access

414
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
now whether or not that's actually

415
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,320
exploitable or something's a different

416
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
question but you know clearly

417
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,320
something's misconfigured here

418
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,160
and we wouldn't necessarily always look

419
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,920
at this big picture to find that out

420
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,160
maybe you could actually start

421
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,519
you know look at looking for this kind

422
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,760
of misconfigured setup

423
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
already so i might say well hang on

424
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
what's the shortest path between a

425
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,399
public security group and a database

426
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,160
and so suddenly this is looking much

427
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,120
more

428
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,639
interesting for us we have our happy

429
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,240
path which goes through the load

430
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,320
balancer through the app server you know

431
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
where we can apply all of our controls

432
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,079
and things and then we go down to our

433
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,240
database perfect but hang on what's this

434
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,720
one here so now it's much more obvious

435
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,160
and if you're gonna start automating

436
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,880
this you can you could start querying

437
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,839
okay show me this paths to the from a

438
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,680
public security group to the database

439
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,760
but not through an app server i'm not

440
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,959
interested in those paths so because

441
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,560
they're you know they're

442
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,399
covered in a different way so now

443
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,639
suddenly we have the real piece that

444
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,320
we're looking for and you can imagine

445
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,959
this being a perfect screenshot to

446
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,120
include in an automated alert so you can

447
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,639
run this now and you can say hey here's

448
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
a picture that looks wrong because we

449
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,399
have some we have some results here and

450
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,199
this is actually what's happening

451
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,440
and someone can then you know it's much

452
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,519
much nicer to go and go and address that

453
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,600
so you've got now you've figured out

454
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,519
what you've where all your stuff is and

455
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,959
now we can start classifying things you

456
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,560
can say oh we've got customer data here

457
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,000
we've got business plans over there

458
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
we've got credit cards maybe we've got

459
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,880
some source code we've got some

460
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,480
documents

461
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,680
really just go through all these

462
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
different things that you've created and

463
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,320
turn them into an actual asset and then

464
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
start classifying those assets

465
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,959
maybe you have an existing risk

466
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,160
framework that you've got maybe you

467
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,199
don't

468
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,639
you know i'm sure you can find some

469
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,560
different levels of classification now

470
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
this is the actual code that will insert

471
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,360
these things into the database it's

472
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,760
saying okay create a card a credit card

473
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,519
asset thing and we're going to classify

474
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,680
it as confidential and then we'll create

475
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,199
on that as source code and classified as

476
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,120
sensitive and then maybe legal

477
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,480
agreements are sensitive maybe business

478
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,600
process internal whatever you're

479
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,560
deciding and you're going to have

480
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
different things that those

481
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
levels mean but you can classify them on

482
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
the assets themselves

483
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
and then again this is what the code

484
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
would be to add those relationships

485
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,279
you're saying oh well amazon stores

486
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,680
customer data or you know amazon stores

487
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,120
ip or something like that you just need

488
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,279
to write all these in and then

489
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,279
um suddenly some pretty cool things are

490
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,839
going to pop out

491
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,920
so let's again have a quick look

492
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,600
so yeah some pretty pretty messy

493
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,040
overview maybe there's some things we

494
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,199
can find here oh hang on like we've got

495
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,199
a service with no data that's being

496
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,360
stored that's mega as well that's weird

497
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,199
why are we even using that so that might

498
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,880
be something we'd be looking into uh

499
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,399
maybe someone hasn't written down what

500
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,360
data we're storing but maybe we're

501
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,560
actually not storing anything and we can

502
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,959
remove it

503
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,720
but you might start filtering this a bit

504
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,120
more and say well actually i'm kind of

505
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,519
interested in confidential data

506
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,120
and so suddenly the picture is looking a

507
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
lot different saying these are the

508
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,079
services now that are storing customer

509
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,320
data in my environment or credit card

510
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,759
data um and this this picture is much

511
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,199
different and now we can start having

512
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,480
this this could you could imagine this

513
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,399
could actually be a query that you save

514
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
and if you're trying to describe how

515
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
you're storing data you could just

516
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,880
always refer to this you know

517
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,839
visualization

518
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,360
so now you've got you know what data

519
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,720
you're storing you think about the

520
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,920
impact if you were to lose some of that

521
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,519
data

522
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,839
and you've got the classic cia you know

523
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,599
confidentiality integrity availability

524
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,199
they can be prompts for you to try and

525
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,359
think of the actual impacts you know and

526
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,280
and it's hard here to go to the to the

527
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,760
real impacts it's it's you know like

528
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,919
real impacts like we lost sales we lost

529
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,000
customers we've lost money we have got

530
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,919
fines

531
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,240
you know more competition for example if

532
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,000
you lost your source code you may not

533
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,679
immediately lose money but your

534
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,839
competitors may now know your secret you

535
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,160
know code that they're gonna start using

536
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,600
and you're gonna you're gonna have to

537
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
lose your competitive advantage it can

538
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,799
be hard to to get to the actual impacts

539
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,799
it can be easy to say like oh yeah well

540
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,559
if our you know

541
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,400
source code was lost then we'd you know

542
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,240
probably get um

543
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,000
we'd get hacked or something you know

544
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,919
like well getting hacked is not the not

545
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,720
the impact uh what happens once you get

546
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
hacked what are the different ways in

547
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
which you can actually suffer some some

548
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,679
loss

549
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,760
and then write those down

550
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,080
now kind of actually have all the pieces

551
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,919
to say we almost have a risk for the

552
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,520
service that we've got now because we've

553
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,440
decided we've defined what we're

554
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,120
protecting what the impact would be if

555
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,280
we lost that data and if we connect them

556
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,559
all together with a threat we've almost

557
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
got a risk as it really is a case of

558
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,080
like colonel mustard in the conservatory

559
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
with the candlestick you know

560
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,919
you now have a really great picture of

561
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,799
your

562
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
sas services i should say this is no

563
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,640
substitute for like proper risk

564
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
assessment and threat modelling

565
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
but if you're not doing any of this it's

566
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,080
a really great start if you give your if

567
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
you give these kind of things to the

568
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
people that you're individually hired if

569
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,280
you eventually hire a risk analyst or

570
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
you know you've got your scissor coming

571
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,919
on board or whatever and you give them

572
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,440
this data it's like oh yeah here's our

573
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,679
starting point you know they probably

574
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,520
jump jump in the air a little bit

575
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
usually it's a bit bit of a

576
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
abysmal state that things uh things are

577
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,639
given over to them

578
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,840
i've got a quick risk demo here

579
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,000
so

580
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
this this

581
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,520
graph we can extend now and say well i

582
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,679
want to see the impacts of those of that

583
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,160
data so for the confidential information

584
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
what's the different impacts i can have

585
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,840
you know for customer data maybe i've

586
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,160
got lose company i've decided it's that

587
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,280
important or

588
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,600
lose customers or are going to lose some

589
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,360
sales and you can really start seeing

590
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
that i haven't really defined the impact

591
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,520
on the service itself but now i can

592
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,200
start seeing hey well what services are

593
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,760
kind of involved in a confidential

594
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
you know data and what impacts would

595
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,679
there be so this query is almost like

596
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,600
your risk of this of this

597
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,200
of this data now and you could save this

598
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,960
query and rerun it in the future if you

599
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
were ever ever wondering like oh what

600
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,280
does our data look like now

601
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
uh you could go a bit more specific like

602
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,440
maybe you want to say um

603
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,120
you know which

604
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,200
assets would eventually end up in an

605
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,520
impact that has caused you fines

606
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,960
and so now you can look at that and you

607
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
can even say well which teams are those

608
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
because i know that the owners

609
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
are in the service of their members of

610
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,039
teams now i can start saying ah well to

611
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,960
get to a fine i could lose customer data

612
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,039
i could lose credit card data maybe

613
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,280
there's some logs that i could lose you

614
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,880
know different different types of ways

615
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,039
of getting being fined

616
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,360
and you can start start

617
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,880
drawing those kind of pictures maybe

618
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,880
there's some things here that stand out

619
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,400
um

620
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,919
and you can go from the other end where

621
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,200
you might say okay well given this

622
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,760
particular service maybe amazon

623
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,600
what kind of impacts can i expect from

624
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,520
amazon service and now you can start

625
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,960
saying oh great okay i've got these

626
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,679
types of impacts for for

627
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,080
my amazon service

628
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,600
and this really is really getting a nice

629
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,960
picture of hey this is now a risk

630
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,559
assessment for this amazon service i've

631
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,640
got i can keep this query and then

632
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,400
continually come back to it and see if

633
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
it's changing over time

634
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,159
someone might change the way that we

635
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,679
store customer data and then that might

636
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,080
change this picture a bit

637
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,360
these are just things that never get

638
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,039
updated by the way like you create them

639
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:48,400
once and then they're in a document and

640
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,000
a wiki and then that's it forever and

641
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,679
you until the person comes across and

642
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,039
it's hard to figure out whether or not

643
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,919
it's

644
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,640
accurate or not

645
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
you might start wondering uh what about

646
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
services with

647
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,039
no impacts that might be interesting to

648
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,880
look at too why do we have services with

649
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,120
no impacts well is it because they are

650
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,360
storing you know external communications

651
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,120
and promotional material we haven't

652
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720
figured out what impact that would be if

653
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,320
we lost those

654
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,240
or maybe it's like we just don't have

655
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,960
any any impacts anything for storing so

656
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,159
that's that's another one we didn't want

657
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,919
to look at and we could actually see oh

658
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,600
well which team is this person and ah

659
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
engineering so i can probably go and

660
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,600
go and look into that a little bit

661
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
further

662
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,600
so now that you've got like an idea of

663
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,799
these risks of these services you can

664
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,559
start considering your controls and

665
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,400
these are the the ones that we already

666
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,080
know about and like

667
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,080
um but in the context of what they're

668
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
protecting they're so much more powerful

669
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,360
you know your multi-fact authentication

670
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,120
if you can now relate this to oh all

671
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,799
these services that store all starter

672
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,640
that has this impact that's why i'm

673
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
using mfa everywhere

674
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,080
and it can be much much easier to

675
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
communicate this with other people in

676
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,280
the company if you're if you come up if

677
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
you end up discussing someone with

678
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,919
something and saying hey we need to do

679
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,640
this mfa um if you don't have this kind

680
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,559
of data to refer back to it can be hard

681
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,159
to convince somebody why it's even

682
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,480
important you know it can be so it's

683
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,240
very easy for someone to say ah no we

684
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,600
know what we're doing you know don't

685
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,679
worry about it's fine

686
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,200
but if you have if you all have a common

687
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
data set to query

688
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,600
it gives you that common language and

689
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,799
yeah you end up making the better

690
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,600
decisions for it

691
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,240
um yes you what the result is you're

692
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,679
really going to start communicating

693
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,520
you've got different views into the same

694
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
data maybe you've got a marketing

695
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,960
manager adding a new sas product and

696
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,159
they want to know hey have i got a

697
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,760
similar assessed product and what

698
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,440
impacts are there on this obsessed

699
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
product and i could query that and and

700
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,039
figure out or maybe a developer is

701
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,080
adding a new feature and they've

702
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,799
classified some data as as confidential

703
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,320
and they want to know what impact that's

704
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,080
going you know what impact that has what

705
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,919
controls do we normally have in place

706
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,960
for um you know confidential data

707
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,559
or your security auditors wondering

708
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,320
about you know services that store card

709
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,360
data and you could pull up that

710
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,200
information for them

711
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,799
and not to forget the business benefits

712
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,960
and opportunities if the you know people

713
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
making business decisions can look at

714
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,280
the way that you're mitigating risk

715
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,200
across your services

716
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,559
maybe that means that they can take on

717
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,159
another risky service

718
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,280
um you know it's all about the

719
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,039
opportunities of

720
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,880
of adding more risk to business really

721
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,760
you need to be confident and and

722
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,559
you know

723
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,159
sure exactly sure about how you're

724
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,440
actually managing risk of all your

725
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,280
services you might decide oh no this

726
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,720
one's we don't want to add the service

727
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,400
because we don't have any controls that

728
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
cover this kind of risk

729
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,600
but on the flip side maybe there's a

730
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,880
riskier service but you have really

731
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
great controls in place already and so

732
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,480
you can you can actually take on that

733
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,760
that business

734
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,159
benefit

735
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,559
and it all comes back to automating it

736
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,960
um so we've been exploring it in the

737
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,880
database at the moment but what i really

738
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,039
want to do is automate it so that

739
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,960
i get alerted when something pops up you

740
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,159
know

741
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,320
that i want to make sure that every day

742
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,159
all third party services still have an

743
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,320
owner that's employed by the company uh

744
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,279
you know as soon as someone's not

745
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,039
unemployed i want to know about that and

746
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,640
in fact if you had the data for when

747
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
somebody was going to be off-boarded you

748
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,720
know you could send them an automated

749
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
message and say hey you're in charge of

750
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
three services and you're leaving the

751
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,440
company soon so can you hand these over

752
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,360
to somebody else and you can start

753
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,279
seeing it shifts from being

754
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,640
something that's typically securely

755
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,240
driven to being

756
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,760
putting the autonomy in the hands of the

757
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,440
people who are actually making the right

758
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
decisions

759
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,240
so

760
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,360
yeah you might have s3 buckets

761
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
everyone knows that s3 buckets need to

762
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,120
be private but then we still need to

763
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,960
create public buckets for things you

764
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,080
know so if you're not classifying the

765
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,600
data that's in your buckets it's hard to

766
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
say which one should be public which one

767
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
should be private and it's all well and

768
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,559
good to have alerts on hey this bucket

769
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,039
has been made prime made by public

770
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,880
but if you can classify the data that's

771
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,400
inside there then you're gonna have a

772
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,240
much better contextual alert around like

773
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,279
oh

774
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,840
a public a bucket that has a sense of

775
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,679
information it was made public and that

776
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,600
can change the way you respond to it and

777
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,760
you can respond quicker

778
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,799
also i want to generate some

779
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,720
documentation from this you know i'm

780
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
thinking maybe i can generate my

781
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,919
information security policy from this

782
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,840
because all things are there should link

783
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,679
back to risks that and link back to

784
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,000
impacts and so if i'm reading through

785
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,360
the information security policy and it

786
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,520
says oh i i must not disable my

787
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,320
antivirus software you know

788
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,559
it can be hard to understand you're like

789
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,480
oh you might have this preconceived

790
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,840
notion of like what an anti-virus

791
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,679
software is or it's outdated or it's not

792
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,720
going to work

793
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,799
without really understanding that what

794
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,559
it actually is protecting and what

795
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,279
controls are being mitigated by this you

796
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,120
know by this tool and if you can find

797
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,640
that out it's much easier to make better

798
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,520
decisions about things

799
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,679
so for example this is open policy agent

800
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,720
it says it's this language to define

801
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,679
policies it's normally used for like api

802
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:51,679
designer things where you can centralize

803
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,440
your access policy to things um and

804
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
think of it like a giant simultaneous

805
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,279
equation solver you just kind of put

806
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,799
your facts in there and then you put

807
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,320
your inputs in and it tells you whether

808
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,720
or not it's able to be solved or not

809
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,480
it's a really neat way of doing it and

810
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,640
it allows you to write quite succinct

811
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
policy um

812
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,799
that is gonna be you know really need to

813
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,840
actually

814
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,559
um and fast to execute against as well

815
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,320
but i wanna i mean this is this is neat

816
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,000
at all but i wanted to make a more

817
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,120
generic use case of it um where we're

818
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
now thinking about hey i want to query

819
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,360
the data in my graph database and now

820
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,679
have a policy to say well if there are

821
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,640
any inputs that um any services without

822
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
any impacts uh you know that i get

823
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,080
alerted about that so there should be no

824
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,480
services without impact or that there

825
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,640
are no public paths to the database

826
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,080
right and that's the one we saw earlier

827
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,600
with the

828
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
database suddenly having ssh access on

829
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,559
it

830
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,240
so i think i even have a demo about that

831
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,440
let's see if that's going to work

832
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,679
so i can i've got this all running just

833
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,720
in some docker containers here and

834
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,159
here you can see

835
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,720
i'm just it's just a post request to the

836
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,320
api this is the open policy agent it's

837
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,720
just an http api and you can give it a

838
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,600
query and if you look back at this first

839
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,039
example you know whether or not it

840
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,880
should be allowed access to a machine

841
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,799
and you can write a policy for that

842
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,440
so you know jeremy i got my password

843
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,919
wrong so i'm expecting you know allowed

844
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,240
as false and unauthorized

845
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
but if i actually got my password right

846
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
i think i put it as super

847
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,919
secret

848
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,640
passphrase

849
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,640
which is obviously not a good super

850
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,679
secret passphrase but here we go uh you

851
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,240
know allowed is equal to true and you

852
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,159
can even just change the box to a proper

853
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,399
box and that would change change the way

854
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,919
that this is evaluated i'm not going to

855
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,200
get into the actual language of this

856
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,960
because it's kind of mind bender but

857
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,320
it's really neat i would encourage you

858
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,200
to go and check it out if you're

859
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
interested in this kind of stuff

860
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
so to actually apply it

861
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,880
to what we're doing

862
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
i've got

863
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,320
another little script

864
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,120
that here

865
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,360
essentially it's going to run

866
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,799
my

867
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,880
query against the graph database and

868
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,960
then throw that data into open policy

869
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,240
agent and see

870
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,159
what do you think you know what does

871
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,520
this work what do you think about this

872
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
data and so there's the policy that it's

873
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
going to evaluate

874
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
it doesn't really matter about the

875
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,320
details i'll just run it for you and see

876
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,159
if it actually goes

877
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,240
um

878
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,159
let me grab the thing i need to copy

879
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,320
so

880
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
uh you can see that like

881
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,679
the rule that we were expecting that we

882
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,520
had no public access to databases that's

883
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
actually false that assumptions false so

884
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,200
we need to go and action that

885
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,159
um probably a weird way but you can see

886
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,640
if we actually fixed this um

887
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,679
fix this situation by deleting that you

888
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,520
know we wouldn't have limited it and we

889
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,360
removed that weird relationship by

890
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,320
changing the actual amazon

891
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,679
infrastructure and re-querying it

892
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:56,960
obviously

893
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,120
not just not just hiding the problem

894
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,240
under the mattress by deleting the

895
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,159
relationship

896
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,080
but here we actually want to now rerun

897
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,919
that query

898
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,200
and we should see

899
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
that

900
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,840
our test passes again

901
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,600
so yeah it's a bit convoluted but you

902
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,039
can imagine you can start building some

903
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,960
more complicated policies that actually

904
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,640
are including way more data from other

905
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,039
sources as well like your you know

906
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,520
employee directory or um

907
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,559
you know

908
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
other it's kind of endless really

909
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,159
um

910
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,399
yeah so wrapping back up again security

911
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,919
is the first thought when we're doing

912
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:33,840
things if we have accurate information

913
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,200
that's up to date

914
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,080
um you know if you're just updating a

915
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,919
value in a table of who's owned

916
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,520
something the value of updating that is

917
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,440
quite low you know you may be saying oh

918
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
well in the future someone will have the

919
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,520
right service owner for the service but

920
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,200
if you're automating it to this extent

921
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,880
and and taking all these different views

922
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,799
the value is much much larger it's kind

923
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,559
of this cascading effect

924
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,840
that updating a small piece of

925
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,840
information has a large effect a large

926
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,279
value i think that's really going to

927
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,600
motivate people to keep it going if you

928
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,039
can actually see the value that you're

929
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,799
getting out of it

930
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,720
especially when it's easy to consume you

931
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,080
know you've got to work on making it

932
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,159
interactive or queryable or maybe it

933
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,919
generates the documentation for people

934
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:12,880
like

935
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,559
not everyone needs to run the actual

936
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,320
graphs in the graph database

937
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,080
but you can see already like different

938
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,600
ways in which data is going to be easy

939
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,679
to consume whether that's an automated

940
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,000
alert includes the screenshot of the

941
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,880
picture that's gone wrong right

942
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,720
and then that makes it actionable

943
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,320
because the information is available

944
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,919
right there right now

945
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,520
in the context of the person who's doing

946
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,480
the work and so you're really

947
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,399
farming out the security decisions to

948
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,480
the actual right people and they're able

949
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,159
to do and make the right decision

950
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,080
because they have the right information

951
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,559
maybe it's a good maybe it ends up as a

952
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,799
question to your security team but how

953
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,000
great would that question be when

954
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,120
someone comes to you and they've done

955
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,480
all the research and they have all the

956
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,240
data and they're just actually asking a

957
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
real you know

958
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,519
this is an actual tricky question those

959
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:58,480
are the ones you really want to be

960
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,720
solving

961
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
and to keep it automated

962
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,039
is to make it continuous all the time

963
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,720
but it's not just when we have an audit

964
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,000
that we look at these things and go

965
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,440
through our services and who has access

966
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,120
to stuff it should be just all the time

967
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,480
so that we immediately know when

968
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,399
something's gone wrong uh imagine in the

969
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,640
next audit you tell the auditor ah well

970
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,159
in the last year we actually had five

971
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,919
instances where we

972
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,679
didn't have the right access controls

973
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,519
here and we this is how we found out

974
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,640
about it and this is what we did about

975
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,039
it you know really really great as

976
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,519
opposed to a point in time you know and

977
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:30,960
then we're not sure what's happening

978
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,200
outside of there

979
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,679
so yeah we got to the end thank you very

980
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,919
much this is supposed to be a github

981
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,760
repo that you can clone and and play

982
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,960
with all this data and do the stuff

983
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,080
yourself

984
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,799
but in typical last minute slide

985
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,240
it's amazing that some of the demos

986
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,120
actually worked so um i'll maybe send a

987
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,960
link out somehow through

988
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,919
uh discord or or however if you're

989
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,679
interested if you are if you really do

990
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:57,760
like this kind of stuff send me an email

991
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,399
that's my the way to subscribe to my uh

992
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:01,760
mailing list

993
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,480
and i'll keep you updated if i um

994
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,480
do some more more cool work on this and

995
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,559
if you want to know about it

996
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,519
yeah thanks very much everybody

997
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,120
you
