1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,279
i want to ask you guys a question

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,880
when you think about cyber security

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,519
threats what image brings to mind

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,599
do you picture hooded hackers in dimly

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,160
lit rooms surrounded by monitors running

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
sophisticated scripts and programs

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,480
do you picture white collar office

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
workers sipping on a cup of coffee while

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,519
entering their same 8 character password

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,599
for 10 different applications do you

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,519
picture your office receptionist on

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,400
facebook

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,320
inadvertently giving out personal

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,520
information

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,440
that can be used to crack security

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,160
questions in seemingly harmless quizzes

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
or do you picture entire companies

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,640
lackluster security systems and

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,680
processes that are poorly enforced

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,600
for most of us the first scenario

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
readily jumps to mind we often see cyber

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,160
security as a technology issue and

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
mistakenly believe that hackers have

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,160
access to superior programs

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,840
that our computer defenses can't

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,960
withstand

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,039
but that's usually not the case

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,920
you see

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,760
the great thing about computers is that

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,920
they're predictable computers do what

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
they're programmed to do all day every

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,479
day which is why well-configured cyber

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,799
security systems seldom fail from a

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
technology standpoint

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,040
humans on the other hand are much more

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,520
volatile they react differently

37
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,400
depending on a range of circumstances

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,479
how tired they are how frustrated they

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,119
are how distracted they are

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,200
all these factors directly contribute to

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
the level of cybersecurity risk posed by

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,680
people in our organizations

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,560
posed by every single one of us

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,360
according to a study by ibm human error

45
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,159
is the main cause of 95 of cyber

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,600
security breaches

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,920
this can be as simple as using the same

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
password

49
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,079
or

50
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,759
clicking on a link without checking its

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,799
source

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,360
one moment of in attention one small

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,479
slip up

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,280
can have disastrous consequences and

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
bring down an entire company or an

56
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,240
institution

57
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,560
that's why cyber security is everyone's

58
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
responsibility

59
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
to show you just how easily we can slip

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,679
up and how disastrous the consequences

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,680
can be i'd like you to picture the

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,360
following scenario

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
it's just another seemingly regular

64
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
wednesday morning at the office you've

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,560
just come back from a big team meeting

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
about an upcoming project

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
you're deep in thought as you return to

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,400
your desk and check your emails as you

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
always do around this time you click

70
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,400
through them and adding notes to your

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
mental to-do list as you go when you

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
come across one from your boss asking

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,440
you to urgently look into

74
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
the attached account files because he

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,959
suspects an error

76
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,959
you open the attachment eager to see

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,879
what's going on and to give boss the

78
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
cause of concern and then it happens

79
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
by the time you realize that you fall

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
into a targeted phishing attack the

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,280
malware has already infected the

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,360
company's network drive

83
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
all the files in the network

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,159
are encrypted by the malware a ransom

85
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,640
request follows the hacker is demanding

86
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,920
hundred thousand dollars for the

87
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,440
decryption key

88
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
this kind of scenario occurs about four

89
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,000
thousand times per day worldwide and

90
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,239
there are many other mistakes we as

91
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,080
humans make that can lead to severe

92
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
cyber security breaches

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
any unintentional action or lack of

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,360
action that causes spreads or allows a

95
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
security breach to take place

96
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,760
today i want to talk about the four

97
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
mistakes

98
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,920
we see people and companies make when it

99
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,760
comes to their cyber security and more

100
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,959
importantly

101
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,959
what you can do about them

102
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
because cyber security is everyone's

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,280
responsibility

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,720
let's start by looking at the first

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,080
mistake which is to aim for 100 security

106
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,159
although this sounds good in theory

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,560
striving for perfectionism can often

108
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
lead us to focus on the wrong things

109
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,959
which in turn exposes us to

110
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,680
vulnerabilities besides there is no way

111
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,200
that hundred person security can be

112
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,239
achieved

113
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,480
the only way to stay safe online is to

114
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,720
fight against your invisible enemy is to

115
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
manage risks effectively

116
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
and the best way to protect yourself and

117
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,280
your business against cyber attack is to

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,319
be prepared and proactively plan your

119
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,439
counter measures to defeat the attackers

120
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,199
sanzu the author of art of war said if

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,918
you know the enemy and yourself you need

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,000
not to fear the result of hundred

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,120
battles

124
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,840
if you know yourself but not the enemy

125
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,560
for every victory gained you will also

126
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
suffer a defeat

127
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,240
if you know neither the enemy or nor

128
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
yourself you will succumb in every

129
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,759
battle

130
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
if you apply this saying to cyber

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
security knowing your enemy means being

132
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,720
aware of any vulnerabilities that are

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
present

134
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,919
and knowing yourself means having a

135
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,000
process and a plan in place to minimize

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,360
exposures before they occur

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,600
you can only win this battle by

138
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
by building cyber security from the

139
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
start and making it everyone's

140
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,600
responsibility

141
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,440
let me give you an example to illustrate

142
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,000
my point in a business environment

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,560
things are constantly changing there are

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,800
regular software updates new patches

145
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,639
being released new personal being

146
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,560
onboarded and so on

147
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,039
this is a risk you need to manage

148
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
i recall a scenario in which an

149
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,560
organization patched most of its

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,639
security vulnerabilities but while

151
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
troubleshooting a server the admin

152
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
accidentally sent a shutdown command

153
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,160
which inadvertently shut down

154
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,320
a large number of servers

155
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
these servers were used by organizations

156
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,280
clients and it took about seven seven

157
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,880
hours before

158
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,160
things were up and running again

159
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
both the organization and its clients

160
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,120
suffered a serious outage which not only

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,440
harmed the organization

162
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
financial position but also their

163
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,960
reputation

164
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
so what can we learn from this situation

165
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
i'd say the biggest takeaway is to have

166
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
a fail-safe backup backup plan in place

167
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,639
to forego this type of human error

168
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,120
specifically i'd suggest implementing a

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,280
process where any action related to

170
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
sensitive data or assets requires the

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,680
review and approval of another team

172
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,800
member

173
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
for example if a user runs a sensitive

174
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,000
command or merges a pr the merge request

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,759
should go to the admins for approval

176
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,680
before the merge is carried out this

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,479
will help identify any bugs or faulty

178
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,199
patches and if bugs are found the merge

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,199
can be declined and

180
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
can stop the code to go to the

181
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,840
production because cyber security is

182
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,319
everyone's responsibility

183
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,880
the second mistake we often come across

184
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,680
is an over reliance on technology

185
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,280
many businesses believe that if they

186
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,199
invest in the best technology then

187
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,560
they're safe

188
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,639
but we often see that this isn't the

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,520
case even organizations with the best

190
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,080
technology and tools that money can buy

191
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,240
are not necessarily shielded from cyber

192
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,240
attacks because no matter which

193
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,479
technology you use if your people are

194
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,800
not skilled and trained in using them

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
the chances of suffering a security

196
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,039
breach are very high

197
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,360
technology alone will not shield you

198
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,000
from cyber attacks instead you need the

199
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,599
people in your organization to

200
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
understand the technology and use it

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
effectively to ward off attacks because

202
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,400
effective cyber security is less

203
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
dependent on technology and more

204
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,359
dependent on people

205
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
don't get me wrong

206
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,080
tools are very necessary and can be

207
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,160
a great starting point to achieve basic

208
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,199
security but the human factor is and

209
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,639
remains

210
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,199
the weakest link in relation to security

211
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,360
both for iit professionals and the end

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,800
user

213
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
investing in the best tools will only

214
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,039
safeguard an organization when the

215
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,720
people understand their roles and

216
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,400
responsibilities in keeping their

217
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,919
network safe

218
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,440
let's understand this from another

219
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,560
example

220
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,720
we recently came across an organization

221
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
who used some of the best in class tools

222
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
for vulnerability assessment

223
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,599
the tool conducted a security assessment

224
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,400
on every website or feature they created

225
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,639
but they later discovered a hack in

226
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,039
which a few internal files were exposed

227
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
to the public

228
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,800
these files contained sensitive

229
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,199
information about lines which again

230
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,160
hugely damaged the company's reputation

231
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
when we conducted an audit we discovered

232
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
that the attack was caused by a

233
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,840
horizontal horizontal privilege

234
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
escalation vulnerability in which a

235
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,479
normal user was able to escalate his

236
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,319
privilege as the admin

237
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,320
this vulnerability was overlooked by the

238
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,279
tool

239
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,958
and because the professional relied

240
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,360
completely on the tools they completely

241
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,719
missed it

242
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,958
this goes to show that having the best

243
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,880
in class tools doesn't automatically

244
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,880
automatically make you safe

245
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
i've worked with small to

246
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,720
small to enterprise size companies

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,040
across the globe and i always advise

248
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,000
them

249
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,640
not to be over reliant on technology or

250
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,519
tools

251
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,920
instead i often suggest conducted

252
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,160
conducting a manual assessment because

253
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,880
humans can find things like business

254
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,519
logic flaws that tools miss

255
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,120
for companies who lack the human

256
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,920
resources for manual assessment i

257
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
recommend taking an alternative approach

258
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,480
that combines manual and automated

259
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
methods

260
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
for example scanning the entire

261
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,839
application application first with

262
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,160
automated tools and then engaging a

263
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,560
third party vendor like security lit to

264
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,200
conduct a gap analysis and penetration

265
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,680
tests to find any loopholes

266
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,560
because often a human eye can pick up on

267
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,800
things that cannot be seen by a tool

268
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,640
and cyber security is everyone's

269
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,640
responsibility

270
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
another common mistake i have seen in

271
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,880
infosec industry is that people seem to

272
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
have this thing in mind that their tools

273
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,480
should be superior to those of hackers

274
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
and although i think it is good to

275
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
understand how attackers target us and

276
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,560
what technology they use

277
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,279
i don't believe that we can simply out

278
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,240
take them

279
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
instead to be safe in the long run your

280
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,279
security approach should be determined

281
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,399
by your attack surface how complex it is

282
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,480
what assets you have that needs

283
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
protection from attackers and so on

284
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,720
i'm not denying how important it is to

285
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,640
stay up to date with the methods and

286
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,480
tools being used

287
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,399
in cyber attacks with constantly

288
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,800
evolving threats we need to stay on the

289
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,600
ball

290
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,000
but it is equally important for company

291
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
management to adopt a flexible proactive

292
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,279
and strategic approach to cyber security

293
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,279
the security policies of a company need

294
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,680
to prioritize investment into critical

295
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,640
asset protection rather than the latest

296
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,040
technology or system to detect every

297
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
niche threat

298
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,120
as a business you should be doing

299
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,839
regular evaluation of iit controls and

300
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,640
people using the technology

301
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,040
from an roi point of view a company

302
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
should evaluate which parts are critical

303
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,200
to continuity and spend security on

304
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
those elements

305
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,720
how can you do this

306
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
by investing your near people and

307
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,839
culture

308
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,839
statistics have shown that an

309
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,920
organization can significantly improve

310
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
its cyber security and reduce the risk

311
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,000
of a successful cyber attack by just

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,680
training your people right

313
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
much of human error results from end

314
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,839
users simply not knowing what the right

315
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
course of action is in the first place

316
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,040
for examples users that aren't aware of

317
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,680
the risk of fishing are far more likely

318
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
to fall for phishing attempts and

319
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
someone who doesn't know about the risk

320
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,480
of public wi-fi

321
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
networks will quickly have their

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
credentials harvested

323
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
a lack of knowledge is almost never the

324
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,760
fault of the user but should be

325
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
addressed by the organization to ensure

326
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,480
the end users have the knowledge and

327
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,920
skills they are required to keep

328
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,560
themselves and the business safe

329
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,399
let me share a story of a breach that

330
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,880
could have been avoided by following a

331
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,120
few simple steps do you remember the

332
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,360
employee i mentioned at the start

333
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
using the same password all over the

334
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,399
place

335
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,480
well he's quite real

336
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
let's name him mark

337
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
as it turns out mac

338
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,160
mark's

339
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,320
lackluster approach to password security

340
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,839
provided detrimental for his

341
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
organization although his organization

342
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
used a bunch of cyber security tools

343
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
like firewalls and other components to

344
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,120
protect its infrastructure against

345
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
attacks

346
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,320
they didn't have any policies in place

347
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,399
for their staff

348
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,360
you know things like password policies

349
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
or training them about cyber security

350
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,760
risks so what happened was that

351
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,880
mark

352
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,120
worked on crucial uh infrastructure

353
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,279
project during the week and ordered food

354
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,279
from a well-known delivery service every

355
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,480
weekend

356
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
so far so good

357
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,240
until one weekend

358
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,320
the website he was using for ordering

359
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,920
food was hacked

360
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,760
and his username and password details

361
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
were leaked

362
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,720
because he was using the same

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
credentials all over the place the

364
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,920
hackers not only got his credentials for

365
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,000
the food delivery side but they could

366
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,839
now also gain access to a server

367
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,079
containing sensitive data from

368
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,920
mark's organization

369
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,680
this severe breach could easily have

370
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,279
been avoided by implementing and

371
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,200
following a password policy and putting

372
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,519
two for two factor authentic

373
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,600
authentication in place

374
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,320
sometimes it doesn't even require a hack

375
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,680
to gain sensitive information

376
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,200
i have seen people writing their

377
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,839
usernames and passwords on sticky notes

378
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,360
and sticking them to their desktop

379
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,320
monitor for all the world to see

380
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,160
and perhaps it's no surprise with the

381
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,480
number of passwords

382
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,959
were expected to remember these days

383
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,279
to avoid these kind of issues consider

384
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,600
having password managers to your

385
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
employees so they can

386
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,160
securely manage their passwords it is

387
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,240
also a good idea to remind employees not

388
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
to take pictures at their workstation

389
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000
because if these are uploaded to social

390
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,959
media with a clear view of sticky notes

391
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
containing credentials then hackers can

392
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,760
easily use those passwords to seize

393
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,480
control over various assets

394
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,720
better yet companies should implement

395
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,199
password policies and guidelines for for

396
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,040
staff to follow

397
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
likely like only saving password in

398
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,240
password managers and only providing the

399
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,079
password to others through the password

400
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,120
manager

401
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,040
if someone else in the organization

402
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
needs access

403
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,240
and rotating passwords every three to

404
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,360
six months

405
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,480
and not posting sensitive information on

406
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
the employee's desk

407
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,639
because cyber security is everyone's

408
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,120
responsibility

409
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,920
and that brings me to the last mistake

410
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
i want to talk about today which is

411
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
pigeon holing cyber security

412
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
responsibility

413
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,199
we see this all the time companies

414
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,360
relying on the iit department their most

415
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
tech savvy employees or even an external

416
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,839
provider to safeguard them from the

417
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,120
cyber attacks

418
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,959
and while it's certainly good a good

419
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,560
idea to hire

420
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,199
skilled professionals it is important to

421
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,680
embed cyber security in your culture

422
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,600
rather than just making few people

423
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,279
responsible for it

424
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,760
as i say cyber security is not a

425
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
department but an attitude

426
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,079
so instead of relying on a few key

427
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,160
people to keep you safe which often

428
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,560
leads to the wider organization not

429
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,040
taking responsibility let's make cyber

430
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
security everyone's responsibility this

431
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
means for example that cyber security

432
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,040
security should become part of hr policy

433
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,760
it also means that cyber security should

434
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,720
play a central role when developing new

435
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,120
i.t systems instead of being merely an

436
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,880
afterthought

437
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,040
a security focused culture is the key to

438
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
reducing human error which is currently

439
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,160
responsible for 95 percent of breaches

440
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,839
but humans don't have to be the weakest

441
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,680
link if we start taking even the

442
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,320
smallest steps towards reducing

443
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,199
the error the human error it can create

444
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,920
huge gains in security so how can we do

445
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,800
this

446
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
well the mitigation of human error has

447
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,199
to come from two angles reducing

448
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,000
opportunity and educating users

449
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,639
the fewer opportunities there are for

450
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,440
error the less users will be tested for

451
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,800
their knowledge

452
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
and the more knowledge your users have

453
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
the less likely they are

454
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,759
they are they are to make a mistake even

455
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,000
when they come across an opportunity to

456
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,519
do so

457
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,279
let's try to understand this from

458
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,120
another example

459
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
we recently came across an organization

460
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
that relied on iit professionals to

461
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,279
protect themselves from cyber attacks

462
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,360
but there was no training or awareness

463
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,519
among the rest of the company

464
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,440
one day an employee from the finance

465
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,040
department received an email from a

466
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
sender posing as the company's iit

467
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,160
administrator

468
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,079
asking for this person's password to

469
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,399
troubleshoot a handful of tasks

470
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,360
as i.t edmonds password was not working

471
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,199
and because this employee didn't have

472
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,279
any cyber security awareness he supplied

473
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,079
the password the attacker acting as an

474
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,480
i.t administrator gained the access to

475
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
the organization's

476
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,959
more than 1k private repositories which

477
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,720
contained sensitive information about

478
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,440
their code base employees clients and

479
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,799
much more

480
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,480
another devastating breach that could

481
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,039
have easily been avoided if all staff

482
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,439
remember what members were trained or

483
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,079
made aware of social engineering attacks

484
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,799
to avoid situations like this

485
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,520
anytime a new employee joins the company

486
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,760
should provide onboarding training that

487
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,919
makes them aware of cyber security risks

488
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
and tactics and educates them on best

489
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,799
practices they should follow like using

490
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,720
a strong password how to detect a

491
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,760
phishing email password sharing policies

492
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
and how to handle sensitive information

493
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,919
that way they have the tools and

494
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,600
knowledge to keep themselves and the

495
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,679
organization safe online

496
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,840
because cyber security is everyone's

497
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,280
responsibility i'm sure you're seeing a

498
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,520
pattern uh here by now

499
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,600
four very different mistakes aiming for

500
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,520
hundred percent security over reliance

501
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,080
on tools trying to out tech hackers and

502
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
pigeonholing responsibility each with

503
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,039
potentially disastrous outcomes

504
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,600
and four very different solutions

505
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,760
having a fail safe in place manually

506
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
checking tools to pick up on missed

507
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,919
flaws investing in people and culture

508
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,000
and training your employees

509
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,200
but what it always boils down to this

510
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,799
cyber security is everyone's

511
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,400
responsibility

512
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,080
i think it's time that we acknowledge

513
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
cyber security and small things like

514
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
having a hard to crack password and

515
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,960
using 2fa can reduce the chance of

516
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
becoming victim to a cyber attack

517
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,000
if you're someone like me having

518
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
more than 20 passwords i suggest using

519
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,120
passphrases it is easy for attackers to

520
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,679
know my pet's name or my birthday

521
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,919
but it's a little harder for them to get

522
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,679
songs or dialogues

523
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,280
from movies that i like

524
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,440
and even if they did guess my password i

525
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,280
still have two-factor authentication in

526
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,080
place

527
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,960
you see what i'm trying to say here

528
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
we just need to acknowledge cyber

529
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960
security and make simple changes around

530
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,559
us that will help us and our data secure

531
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,799
the only way for humans to be safe from

532
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,679
cyber attack is to act less like a human

533
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,320
when we are interacting with technology

534
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,919
cyber security is everyone's

535
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,360
responsibility

536
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,919
and anybody can be part of the solution

537
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,840
investing in tools and technology is

538
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,039
important but empowering your people is

539
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,200
equally important

540
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,320
whether it is your people in the

541
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,559
workplace or in family

542
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
humans are the key to the solution and

543
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
they cannot be replaced by any

544
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,280
technology

545
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,600
they can be a solid first line first and

546
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,559
last line of defense if trained right

547
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,799
small steps towards cyber security by

548
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,880
each of us will protect us from big

549
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
cyber attacks

550
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,120
because they only need to win once but

551
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,440
we have to win every time

552
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,679
thank you

553
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,360
you
