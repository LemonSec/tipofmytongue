1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,080
sweet g'day uh

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,400
i'm peter i am a security consultant

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,080
from up in wellington um run a company

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,040
up there

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,559
um

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,480
i was once an electrical engineer and

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,320
enjoy breaking things and

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,439
having a whole bunch of halftime

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
projects in my life

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
um

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,039
so i realized that the name of this talk

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,240
was probably a bit

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,039
not

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,760
entirely obvious

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,039
it's nothing to do about brewing beer

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,960
but it's more about home brewing kind of

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,600
hacking tools um

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,960
there are

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,520
lots of sweet security tools available

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
and some of them cost a bunch and i'm a

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,280
tight ass by nature and i like to be

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,160
able to prove that i can do things

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,360
myself

24
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200
so um this is just kind of talking a

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,719
little bit about how how some of the

26
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,480
things you can do is diy

27
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,640
um how you can do them yourself and how

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
you can kind of experiment with them

29
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
um hack five have a whole bunch of

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,960
really cool things like the usb rubber

31
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,280
ducky and um

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
wi-fi pineapple

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,600
but

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
hey they're kind of expensive

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,280
and b at the moment to actually get

36
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,720
anything in the country here it takes

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
forever so um

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,200
diy and it can be kind of useful

39
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,560
and you know if you buy something like

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,000
off-the-shelf then it generally actually

41
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,040
works

42
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,080
and that's way too easy

43
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,439
um

44
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,640
so why might you want to go and build

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,159
things yourself

46
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
you can fully customize them you don't

47
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,600
feel quite as bad if you're going to

48
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,079
break them or lose them um

49
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,360
you can sometimes do it way cheaper and

50
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,000
sometimes maybe not

51
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,280
that great sense of achievement of

52
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,720
actually doing something

53
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,159
helping contribute like the open source

54
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,680
community as well

55
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,720
and it's pretty impressive what you can

56
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,759
do with like a raspberry pi or an

57
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,240
arduino

58
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,520
so

59
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,119
very briefly because most of the stuff

60
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,880
talks about using arduinos and raspberry

61
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,720
pi's just covering

62
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,840
the difference between the two

63
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,759
arduinos are microcontrollers that are

64
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,920
cheap they've got lots of inputs and

65
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,960
outputs

66
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,759
and you use the program using an ide

67
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,119
but essentially you're writing code from

68
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,719
scratch

69
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,280
where a raspberry pi is a microprocessor

70
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
so it's just a mini computer it runs an

71
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,200
operating system on it so in the case of

72
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,920
raspberry pi generally linux build um

73
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,760
more expensive and generally less inputs

74
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,280
and outputs so they're kind of useful

75
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,599
for different

76
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,800
things um

77
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,160
so the first tool i'm going to talk

78
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,920
about is a rubber ducky which is

79
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,520
essentially a usb stick you can plug

80
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,760
into someone's computer and it acts like

81
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
a

82
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
like a device or human interface device

83
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,440
so acts like a keyboard

84
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,599
you can buy them off like k5 for like 50

85
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,440
bucks um

86
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,879
and when you plug it into the machine it

87
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
just runs a script so it'll do some

88
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,319
things like it could go and change

89
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,640
passwords go to a url

90
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,239
download some software create a reverse

91
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,360
shell out

92
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,840
and if you've got like a

93
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
device protection on your machine so it

94
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,120
doesn't look at usb devices it's not

95
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,080
actually going to notice this because it

96
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
just looks straight like a keyboard and

97
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
you generally don't want to go and block

98
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,840
people from using keyboards on your

99
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,400
corporate machines

100
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
and so they're quite hard to defend

101
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
against

102
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,200
so

103
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,840
what i did was

104
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
um

105
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,000
bought a little uh

106
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,840
it's like an tiny device so

107
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,360
um they're just like a commercially

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,879
off-the-shelf thing

109
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,640
and program that up

110
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,720
there's totes not suspicious

111
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,640
and they're kind of a similar size to

112
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
like a normal usb stick although they

113
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
they look totally suspicious unless you

114
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,040
actually put them in a casing or

115
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
something

116
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,879
compared to a usb rubber ducky that's

117
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,200
like 50 bucks you can buy like

118
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,599
these like 250 each from china

119
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,319
and

120
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,920
they come surprisingly quickly as well

121
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,319
um to program one up is pretty easy

122
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,000
unless you are me and trying to do it in

123
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,519
the middle of the night and everything

124
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,120
is breaking and then you realize that

125
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
you just need to plug a usb hub in to

126
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
program it through because it doesn't

127
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
want to program straight out of your

128
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,439
laptop

129
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,920
you can just pop open the arduino ide

130
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
download some digispark drivers

131
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
get some example code push upload plug

132
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,760
in the usb

133
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,360
and make it do the things you want to do

134
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,439
so the kind of things that you can do

135
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,480
straight out of the box just using

136
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,238
pre-written scripts

137
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,000
like creating accounts creating those

138
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
reverse shells

139
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,720
in my case

140
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,120
doing rick rolls

141
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,160
and

142
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,440
and so the code's really really simple

143
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
to write

144
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
um

145
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
and i've learned that if you plug into a

146
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,560
machine

147
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,400
that um

148
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,160
you haven't put an ad blocker on this

149
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,199
doesn't really work very well because it

150
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,479
actually plays an ad for 10 seconds

151
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
before you get to rick roll someone

152
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,320
um

153
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
but uh there's also a really cool open

154
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,520
source community around this kind of

155
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,960
stuff as well so lots of people have

156
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,080
used these at tinies for emulating usb

157
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,280
rubber duckies

158
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,400
and so someone came up with a um

159
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,680
basic little website that just goes and

160
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
converts um

161
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
the native rubber ducky code i think

162
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,320
it's

163
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,440
uh

164
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,039
whatever it's called i think it's like

165
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,560
rubber code or something

166
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,800
or ducky code and it converts it into

167
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,639
the arduino code so that you can just go

168
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,400
and publish that onto the usb and it

169
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
just works

170
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,680
so that's pretty cool

171
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,280
these things are super cheap

172
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,639
they are really easy once you get over

173
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,960
stupid hurdles like having to plug in a

174
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
usb hub to actually program the things

175
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,039
and there's really good community around

176
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
it they do look super sketchy though

177
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,919
unless you go and like put it into

178
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
another usb case so it's much harder to

179
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
actually trick people with

180
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,280
and there's a limited memory size on

181
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,960
them as well

182
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
um

183
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,880
and i will put slides somewhere with

184
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,840
links and things on later

185
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,680
another popular tool

186
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,199
are wi-fi pineapples um

187
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,840
used for wi-fi auditing uh if you get a

188
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
proper wi-fi pineapple they've got like

189
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,160
a pretty web ui you can like create um

190
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
rogue aps and stuff with them

191
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,160
do um wpa and wp enterprise tx and

192
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
do like wi-fi surveillance as well with

193
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,000
them

194
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,479
if you want to do a diy alternative

195
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,880
fruity wi-fi is a package that can be

196
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
used and you can just run it on a

197
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,000
raspberry pi it takes 20 minutes to

198
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
install

199
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,520
and shut the external wifi card in there

200
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,120
and then it

201
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
provides you with like a web ui to do

202
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,479
most of the same stuff as you could do

203
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,880
on a wi-fi pineapple but just quicker

204
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,000
and you can just use an external wi-fi

205
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
card with it

206
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,000
um

207
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
and so there's just a whole bunch of

208
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,039
different packages that you can

209
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,120
essentially install uh through fruity

210
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,919
wi-fi so things like um

211
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,400
you can create a create an ap have auto

212
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,039
ec so that you can have it um

213
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,400
essentially be able to easily remote

214
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,280
into it

215
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,240
uh

216
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,400
there's a metasploit interpreter modules

217
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,280
for it

218
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
you can create captive portals in it

219
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
just straight off the shelf there's mf

220
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,479
and nasa built in as well as well about

221
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
30 other modules so it's super easy to

222
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,759
use

223
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,800
and it's really easy to set up

224
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
but then also probably not actually that

225
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,520
much cheaper than just going and buying

226
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,520
one off the shelf um

227
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,960
i think the wi-fi panel was about 100

228
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,479
bucks and by the time you buy a

229
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,240
raspberry pi and you get the usb dongle

230
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,360
and stuff

231
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,280
it's probably pretty similar although

232
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
you can do that overnight versus having

233
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,479
to wait a couple weeks to get things

234
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,719
from the states

235
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,080
they're fairly easy to set up there's a

236
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,280
pretty good community around it

237
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,160
you can just use existing hardware for

238
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,440
it as well

239
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
but they're not really as discreet they

240
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,759
don't look as pretty and um

241
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,960
the

242
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,720
uh the module was last kind of updated

243
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
in like february 2020 so it looks like

244
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,440
it's probably being discontinued at this

245
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,800
point

246
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,840
they're not getting that much love

247
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,639
um

248
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,120
the the third kind of useful tool

249
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,599
is um being able to port mirror

250
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,479
um

251
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,240
so in the world of cisco that'd be

252
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,759
creating a span port

253
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,039
but rather than having to buy like a

254
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,039
nice fancy switch to do it

255
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
there are cheaper ways to do it as well

256
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:13,840
so

257
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,560
port mirroring is um

258
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,400
packet duplication so being able to go

259
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,639
and replicate the traffic going between

260
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,680
point a and b onto another port which um

261
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,720
without

262
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
without

263
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,280
mirroring you wouldn't be able to do

264
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
and then you can run wireshark on that

265
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,919
packet capture interface and go and see

266
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,120
all the things going between a and b

267
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,240
um

268
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
tp links so like a really cheap 50

269
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,159
switch that you can do that with

270
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
um you need to throw a wireshark on a

271
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,640
capture device which could just be a

272
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
raspberry pi that you've used previously

273
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,399
and if you need to be able to monitor

274
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,240
that you can just throw a second um

275
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,680
network interface on it so just like a

276
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,279
usb um

277
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,279
ethernet adapter

278
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,920
uh the interfaces for these things are

279
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,480
super easy

280
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
and

281
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
like the little tp-link switches which

282
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,519
um are pretty cool uh only like 50 bucks

283
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,680
and it's a fully managed little switch

284
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,440
um

285
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,399
so yeah

286
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,120
the

287
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,240
the main thing i kind of wanted to show

288
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,440
here was just

289
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,519
there are really easy cheap ways to go

290
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,480
and

291
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,200
get some what would otherwise be

292
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,519
more expensive hacking tools

293
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,920
and pretty easy to build as well

294
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
but yeah that is

295
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,910
that is my very quick talk so thank you

296
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,380
[Applause]

297
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,440
you
