1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
hello chikon

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,760
uh sorry i can't be there in person but

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,800
uh

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,280
lockdown is what it is uh so

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,599
we'll see how we go with this one

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,720
okay so my name's tom um

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,560
i am not a lawyer as the slide says um

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,599
but i am an embedded software engineer

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,640
um

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,560
so while i talk i will put this up so

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,199
you've got something to look at um

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,479
yeah so i've been embedded software

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,800
developer for over 20 years and for the

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
last 10 years embedded devices have

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,040
become more and more connected

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,120
and effectively embedded connected

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,399
devices are iot devices you can spend a

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,920
few hours arguing about the difference

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,280
between the two but effectively they all

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
come under the heading of iot

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
so as i said i'm a developer i work for

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,399
a company called technique and we design

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,559
cameras for other companies

24
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,920
companies that don't have the their

25
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
expertise or the resource to be able to

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,359
do it themselves

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,359
and most of these cameras are connected

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
in some way wi-fi bluetooth 4g

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,439
um

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,960
there's pretty much always a connection

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,799
to the outside world which basically

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,920
means they're iot devices

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,520
and more and more we're starting to see

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,840
customers come to us with requirements

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,640
of projects that need to meet various

36
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,240
iot legal standards for security

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
um this is precisely to prevent the kind

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,000
of thing you're seeing in the in a

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,439
little comic up there

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,880
um but i wanted to talk a little bit

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,159
about the requirements that we're

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,600
getting from customers and this isn't

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,040
new this has been happening for the last

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,159
year or two

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,040
um

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,920
but hopefully this is starting to help

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,119
protect us from the worst cases of iot

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,439
insecurity

49
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,320
so firstly our old friend gdpr

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
gdpr came into force in 2018 so it's

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
been around for a few years now

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,560
really covers um

53
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,040
any organization collecting data

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,280
to do with eu citizens but because it's

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,920
difficult to say where eu citizens are

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,600
and what products get sold in which part

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,880
of the world

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,360
it's generally sort of regarded as

59
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,038
something you want to try and meet

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,599
wherever your products are being sold

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,120
so it doesn't really say anything

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
specific about iot

63
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
but it does say a lot about how you

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
collect and store consumer data as you

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280
can see there it talks about student

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,480
anonymization encryption confidentiality

67
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,239
all of those kind of good things to do

68
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,840
to make sure that people aren't staining

69
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,519
your data

70
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,040
and it enforces this with a series of

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
fines and they can get pretty high

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,959
so you want to try and avoid that as

73
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
much as possible

74
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,239
so as i said gdpr doesn't really talk

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,160
about iot specifically but it does talk

76
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,560
about data and what we're starting to

77
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,120
see now is customers talk about

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
handling data in a way that means it

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
can't get stolen or leaked

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,879
and you're starting to see things like

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,519
this where you've got some kind of iot

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,560
device you set it up using a phone and

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
the app on the phone generates an

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,959
asymmetric key pair it sends the public

85
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,640
key to the device

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
the device then uses that public key to

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
encrypt data that it pushes up to the

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,080
cloud in some way

89
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
the phone then pulls that data down and

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
it uses the private key to decrypt the

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,760
data and show it on the phone

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,640
so even if your cloud system gets hacked

93
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,360
or the end device or anything like that

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
the person hacking that

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,239
as long as you've done a good

96
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,280
implementation can't view the data it's

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,239
only viewable to the end user

98
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,519
um

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,200
and i thought this was only a sort of

100
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,720
theoretical concept we've talked to a

101
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,159
few customers about this but quite

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,680
recently i saw

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,599
tesla rolling out this new feature on

104
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,040
their cars

105
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,440
you can basically view the cars cameras

106
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,879
on your phone to see if anyone's

107
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,879
standing next to the car before you walk

108
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,920
out to it

109
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
and it says end to end encrypted

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,439
now i haven't looked into the

111
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,879
implementation

112
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,000
but

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
the idea here is that you pay your phone

114
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,000
to the car and only you can view that

115
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
encryption feed that encrypted feed so

116
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,920
it's a similar kind of concept it's the

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,360
kind of thing you might want to look at

118
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,239
doing

119
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,640
to make sure that your device doesn't

120
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,399
infringe gdpr if it gets hacked

121
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
secondly

122
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,238
california senate bill 327 or sb 327 um

123
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,759
this one's a little bit newer came to

124
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,880
force on the

125
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,199
1st of january 2020.

126
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
now amazingly for a piece of legislation

127
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,520
it's extremely short it's only about a

128
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,600
page long

129
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
and really all it says is it requires

130
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
all iot devices sold in the state of

131
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,720
california to be equipped with

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,440
reasonable security

133
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,280
except devices that come under federal

134
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,479
law for example medical devices

135
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,080
but yeah what does what does reasonable

136
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,320
security mean i mean the only thing it

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,040
explicitly spells out is really about

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,199
passwords either the password has to be

139
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,280
unique for each device or the device

140
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,960
forces the user to generate a new

141
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,880
password when they first set it up and

142
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
that's it

143
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,520
and everything else is just kind of that

144
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,160
that phrase reasonable security um so i

145
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
suspect that what's going to happen here

146
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
is that we're going to see legal cases

147
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,560
that enforce this kind of

148
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,440
uh uh set up precedent so if someone

149
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,360
brings a legal case then there may be

150
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
precedent there for what device may

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,919
infringe this bill

152
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
the other point to make here is that

153
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,440
california

154
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,280
is only one state in the us obviously

155
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,600
but it's a pretty big state

156
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
and suppliers when you make a product

157
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,280
for the us suppliers really don't want

158
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,039
to have to differentiate between states

159
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,560
when they sell products

160
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,759
so if you're selling a product in the

161
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,440
u.s it really has to meet requirements

162
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,000
for all 50 states so this is effectively

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,960
saying

164
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,680
that

165
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
any product in the us really needs to

166
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,440
meet this requirement

167
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,880
but as i said it's a bit vague about

168
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,639
what this requirement is

169
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,919
and i had a look around it's been

170
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,759
enforced for what just over a year and a

171
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:52,960
half now

172
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,400
and i had a look around and i couldn't

173
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
find any examples of this bill really

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
being used the only one i could find a

175
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,319
reference to was the

176
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
vocado or vacater hack which was in

177
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
march a whole bunch of security cameras

178
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
online got hacked

179
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,440
and um there was this article that found

180
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,520
a mention that

181
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,039
sp327 could be used to um prosecute this

182
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,440
company i haven't seen anything else

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,600
apart from that but again one to keep an

184
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,919
eye on because those precedents

185
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,960
um

186
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,120
will come into force

187
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,960
we'll establish what force can be used

188
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,919
against

189
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,880
companies and friendship

190
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,080
so the other one we've been asked to

191
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,360
look at

192
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
is what you may not have heard of

193
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,039
but it's starting to become reasonably

194
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,319
common we've done a couple of products

195
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,440
of this

196
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,919
this is firstnet

197
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,240
firstnet was first discussed in response

198
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,000
to 11.9 which in the us is known as 911.

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,160
which highlighted the ability inability

200
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
for deployed public safety networks to

201
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,400
handle a true crisis situation basically

202
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,759
what happened was the mobile phone

203
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,360
networks went down everyone was trying

204
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,720
to call their mum

205
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,800
and uh their network couldn't handle it

206
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,039
and nobody could use the phones

207
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,360
so the idea is to set up a separate

208
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,280
mobile phone network for first

209
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
responders

210
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,000
and the contract was finally awarded to

211
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,520
att in 2017 and it uses a separate band

212
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
in the us band 14 which isn't used by

213
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
any other mobile phone network

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,759
and basically you just have to be in one

215
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,919
of these groups law enforcement fire

216
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,199
emergency

217
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,400
medical

218
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
you have to be in one of these groups to

219
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,400
apply to get a sim card on firstnet and

220
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,080
then you put that sim card into your

221
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
phone or a device and

222
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
you get access to this specialized

223
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,440
mobile phone network

224
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,479
and

225
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
they also provide the ability for things

226
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
like mobile cell sites so you see

227
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,560
somewhere areas where they have um

228
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,080
a forest fire or something like that

229
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,440
possibly in an area where there isn't

230
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,919
very good service cell service

231
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,000
you can take a mobile cell site for

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,520
firstnet out there and all of the first

233
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,280
responders who've got firstnet devices

234
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,879
will be able to connect to that

235
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,680
and get access to mobile phone network

236
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,039
and obviously to be able to communicate

237
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,160
with each other

238
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,919
and it's not going to get used by you

239
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,360
know a local teenager trying to watch

240
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,680
netflix or something like that

241
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
so you'll possess your bandwidth

242
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,000
um

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,919
firstnet obviously it's somewhat

244
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,680
specialized in its first first

245
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,160
responders but it also is relevant

246
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,400
because it's a pretty good

247
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,759
um

248
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,120
security requirement

249
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,560
i will go into that in more detail in a

250
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,440
minute but um so when other government

251
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,039
departments are looking at purchasing

252
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,519
equipment they may well look at firstnet

253
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,120
certification and say well that's this

254
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,559
is obviously a good product because it's

255
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
already passed firstnet you also get

256
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,080
quite a lot of consumers especially in

257
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,479
the us who like buying products that are

258
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,200
approved for use by police and emergency

259
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
services because they think that's a

260
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,519
good mark of quality

261
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,720
so what kind of things are we talking

262
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
about here well obviously there's the

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
phones themselves but there are other

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
devices that will connect firstly as

265
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,519
well and the most

266
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,959
known one

267
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,519
is these things body cams

268
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,720
um

269
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,760
so the

270
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,959
the first generation of these didn't

271
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
connect but the newer ones do and the

272
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
idea is there that they're constantly

273
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
uploading the video either as a live

274
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,920
feed or as a post-process buffered feed

275
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,120
to the internet so if the camera

276
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
is broken or something like that you

277
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
still capture the video data it was

278
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
recording you can imagine a situation

279
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,880
where the police officer says oh yeah i

280
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,120
lost my camera because the um the person

281
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,560
we were reaching struggled and then they

282
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
accidentally fell out a window and we

283
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
don't know what happened

284
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,680
uh or a police officer goes missing and

285
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,800
you're trying to find out what they were

286
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,279
up to before they disappeared so

287
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,640
that's the idea of being able to upload

288
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,439
from body cameras

289
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,880
so what

290
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,480
security requirements do you have to

291
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,160
match to

292
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,120
be able to sell a product on firstnet

293
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
well

294
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
there's a list of 30 security

295
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
requirements

296
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
and you i'm sure you can read that

297
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,920
because the text is quite small i'm not

298
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,959
going to attempt to go through every

299
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,240
single one because it's a relatively

300
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,440
short talk

301
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
what i have done

302
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,040
is broken them up

303
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,399
by the os top 10 for iot vulnerabilities

304
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,959
which was last updated in 2018 it's

305
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,040
still reasonably up-to-date in terms of

306
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,760
what iot devices are most vulnerable

307
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,240
so i basically split them up into these

308
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,079
just to give you an idea of how they

309
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,560
affect um the different areas where iot

310
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
devices are vulnerable

311
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,320
so number one weak guessable or harder

312
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
coded passwords um oh by the way i

313
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,640
i'm not attempting to um say that these

314
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,399
are the exact definitions and everyone

315
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,240
should listen to me if you quibble about

316
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,800
the way i've laid these out um then feel

317
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,880
free to come and chat to me afterwards

318
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,399
but um i tried to break them down to

319
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,519
make it a little bit more obvious so

320
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,040
yeah weak guess what or hardcoded

321
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,760
passwords you mustn't have hardcoded

322
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,839
credentials across all of the devices

323
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,519
the credentials need to be reasonably

324
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,519
complex um

325
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,600
they need to be non-unique if you do a

326
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
reset

327
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,560
and there needs to be some sort of

328
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,920
limitation on the number of times you

329
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,279
can log in

330
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,440
pretty basic stuff

331
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,279
insecure network services again um

332
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,720
only want to

333
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,320
enable the network services that are

334
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,600
actually relevant on the device

335
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,360
you need to make sure that they're all

336
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,600
checked for vulnerabilities um you need

337
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
to make sure it's secure

338
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,319
sorry i hit the button um

339
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,640
you need to turn off remote login and

340
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,079
those kind of things by default and you

341
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,600
need to make sure your web apis are

342
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
secure this is pretty standard stuff but

343
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,120
as i said it's laying it out in some

344
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,600
detail

345
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,720
insecure ecosystem interfaces

346
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,040
um so parallel wireless connections use

347
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,720
best practice authentication encryption

348
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,959
measures i'm i'm still not entirely sure

349
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
what best practice is in these kind of

350
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,399
situations but i mean you just need to

351
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,320
do a reasonable job

352
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
management connections connections to

353
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,680
external services this is all pretty

354
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
standard stuff

355
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,519
lack of secure update mechanism this is

356
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
a really key one um you need to have a

357
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,040
secure boot press

358
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,320
but process

359
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,760
the firmware files need to be

360
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
transferred securely

361
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,760
if they're publicly accessible they need

362
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,200
to be encrypted at rest you can't just

363
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,959
pull them apart they need to be just

364
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,360
digitally signed and validated

365
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
and they need to update

366
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
remotely by default obviously you can

367
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
have some way of asking it not to update

368
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,519
during the day or something like that

369
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
but you have to know that those updates

370
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,880
are going to be applied whatever the

371
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,439
user does

372
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,680
use of insecure or outdated components

373
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,240
this is also a really key one um you

374
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,839
need to make sure that open source

375
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,160
libraries are invented and tracked

376
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,079
you need to make sure they're up to date

377
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,920
you need to test the system software for

378
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,399
vulnerabilities you need to turn on the

379
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,880
security hardening in the os

380
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
you need to have some way of reporting

381
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
issues

382
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,519
you need to have a way of actually

383
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,200
checking your devices so this probably

384
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
means you're going to be bringing in an

385
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,800
external pen testing company and finally

386
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,399
you want to turn on all of the compiler

387
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,360
and chipset hardening

388
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
now the uh the ones who haven't fallen

389
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,120
asleep there will notice i just skipped

390
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,200
over six insufficient privacy protection

391
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
as i said i just broke up the 30 into

392
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,480
the most

393
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,399
obvious ones but you could certainly say

394
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:13,839
that some of these would address privacy

395
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,600
protection as well

396
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
so number seven insecure data transfer

397
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,000
and storage um don't send data clear

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,800
text and don't store stuff clear text on

399
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,600
the device pretty basic

400
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
number eight lack of device management

401
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,320
this is more of a

402
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,160
a first responder type thing because you

403
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,519
wouldn't expect this so much for

404
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,800
consumers

405
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,639
but um obviously you want to be able to

406
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
change the logins a compact sliver is

407
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,279
required you need to be notified of

408
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,680
potential security issues and updates

409
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,360
and you need to have some way of logging

410
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,680
security issues and system faults

411
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
again i skipped over number nine in

412
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,360
secure default settings but some of

413
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,880
these supply anyway

414
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,480
and then number 10 lack of physical

415
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,320
hardening you need to make sure that the

416
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,240
various debugging interfaces on the

417
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,399
hardware are actually disabled so you

418
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,959
can't just plug in a jtag and

419
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,319
pull all the data off the device

420
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,560
so that's basically the 30 requirements

421
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
you've got there

422
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,240
now the interesting thing about firstnet

423
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,040
is

424
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120
these are ongoing

425
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
so i've i've highlighted a few of the

426
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,720
issues here

427
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,800
you need to make sure that your um open

428
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,079
source libraries are tracked for new

429
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,519
vulnerabilities you need to make sure

430
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,040
they're up to date you need to have a

431
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,920
plan for remediating this stuff so

432
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,440
you're starting to talk about things

433
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,160
like um i think github as a way of

434
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,199
telling you

435
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,360
what vulnerable libraries you're using

436
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,279
you can use something like snick there's

437
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
the owasp dependency check which is a

438
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,720
free tool to be able to do this

439
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
basically it looks at your build system

440
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
tells you what

441
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
finds out what libraries you're using

442
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,160
and then looks at those libraries

443
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
against a list of cvs to see what

444
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,720
vulnerabilities are being published

445
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,880
so the idea here is that

446
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,279
if you get a new vulnerability against

447
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,880
something you're using in your software

448
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,800
you need to update the software and you

449
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,560
need to release that in a reasonable

450
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
time you also have to have ongoing pen

451
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
testing being done

452
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,519
um

453
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,880
so basically it's a it's a kind of

454
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,320
rolling thing you're not just selling

455
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
the product

456
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,920
and the other thing that's noteworthy

457
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,480
about firstnet is

458
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,560
this kind of idea of saying oh i've

459
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,399
raised an issue against your device and

460
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,920
the vendor comes back goes oh it's

461
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,480
obsolete we're not going to fix that

462
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,320
you can't do that with firstnet because

463
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,160
the firstnet requirements are reviewed

464
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,600
every year

465
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,519
now i've looked into the documentation

466
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,279
around firstnet i haven't actually

467
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,680
specifically found anywhere that says

468
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,720
if you failed the requirements a few

469
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,079
years after you release a product that

470
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,759
they would actually block the products

471
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,560
then

472
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,680
but you certainly wouldn't be able to

473
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,199
sell them with firstnet written on them

474
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
anymore and if they did actually block

475
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
them from the network i'm assuming that

476
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,399
unless you've made it very very clear

477
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,959
when you sold the products that

478
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,040
you're going to be facing a few lawsuits

479
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,680
from the companies you sold them to

480
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,279
so

481
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,279
firstnet

482
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,800
it

483
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,639
gives you a pretty good

484
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,040
standard for security on iot it's it's

485
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,399
certainly higher than you'd expect to

486
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,639
see on consumer products this idea of

487
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,000
reviewing it every year you you

488
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
certainly wouldn't get that in the

489
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,959
consumer environment but the idea of

490
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,399
laying out all of those requirements

491
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,320
really quite specifically gives you a

492
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,199
pretty solid

493
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
requirement for security far more so

494
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,600
than the something like sb 327 which

495
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
just says hey you make your device

496
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,480
secure and then doesn't really give you

497
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
any guidance as to how to do that

498
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,199
so those are the three

499
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
um standards that we've been asked to

500
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,079
look at by our customers um they're not

501
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,320
the only stands by any means

502
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,560
so just to give you a rough idea this is

503
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,240
a diagram i usually came across this

504
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,360
last night

505
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,279
that shows how all of the different

506
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,279
standards for iot that are currently out

507
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,639
there interact

508
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,399
and i'm not even going to attempt to

509
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
read it

510
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,959
because you can see how complex it is

511
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,560
so some of the other standards you'll

512
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,439
start to hear about in iot

513
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,240
uh

514
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,919
the european standard this was come up

515
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,839
with by the european telecommunications

516
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,240
standards institute

517
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,039
it's not mandatory yet so this is just a

518
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,480
general guide

519
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
for people who want to sell products

520
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,880
and the idea with the etsy standards is

521
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,319
they're they're they're open standards

522
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,480
they can be adopted

523
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,839
by countries

524
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,879
uh or others um individuals um

525
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,160
when you want them it's almost like

526
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
having an open standard

527
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
um

528
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,280
so you're starting to see this this will

529
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,960
probably be adopted by the european

530
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
union but you're also starting to see

531
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
other countries look at this one um i

532
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,120
think the uk are planning to do

533
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,400
something along these lines obviously

534
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,679
they're not in europe anymore so who

535
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,960
knows what they're doing

536
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,880
um but this that picture i just showed

537
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
you was from this link at the bottom iot

538
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
security mapping it basically looks at

539
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,720
all of the different standards around

540
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
the world and maps them to the etsy

541
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,760
standard

542
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,039
to show

543
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,360
which standards are what so the idea is

544
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,039
there that if you meet the etsy standard

545
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,880
you can basically say you're meeting the

546
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
standards for all these different

547
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,840
countries at the same time which makes

548
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,600
things a lot simpler

549
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,880
[Music]

550
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,360
the know what i've seen um

551
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,799
is the

552
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,919
australian standard um again this is

553
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,240
just a guidance document it's not

554
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,000
mandatory yet um i also don't

555
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,679
it's somewhat confusing that iot

556
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,520
alliance australia

557
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,840
in the document they publish they refer

558
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,480
to themselves both as iot a and iot

559
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,520
double a

560
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,720
i don't know if that means they're two

561
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,240
different things or they're just

562
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
confused

563
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,240
um who knows

564
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
but um they probably just a guideline

565
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,440
it's it's kind of hard to break it down

566
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
into different pieces because um

567
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,440
they've just basically linked to a whole

568
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
bunch of different other standards but

569
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
you you'll almost certainly see the the

570
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,240
australian government bringing in some

571
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,760
sort of standards for these things as

572
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
well

573
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,918
so um

574
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,360
that's basically it um these are the

575
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,240
standards we're seeing um come in

576
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,360
customers are asking us to address um

577
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,039
and i'm sure that some of these will

578
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,280
become mandatory over time but it gives

579
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,799
you a rough idea of what you're starting

580
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,760
to see in the iot space

581
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,960
okay that's the end of the talk um

582
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,880
thank you very much and i hope you enjoy

583
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,280
the rest of the conference
