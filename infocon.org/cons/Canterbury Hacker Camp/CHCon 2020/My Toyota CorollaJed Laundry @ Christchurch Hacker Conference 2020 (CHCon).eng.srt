1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,720
the magic of technology

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,799
um if i could tell the seven-year-old

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,080
myself that i would have

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,679
something in my pocket that was way more

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,440
powerful than the most powerful computer

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,240
i had at the time and i'd be presenting

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,199
yeah just amazing hi everybody my name

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,039
is jed

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,600
last year i left my job as a in-house

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,359
security manager to

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,800
work as a security consultant at a

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,880
managed service provider

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,960
i provide guidance and support i do a

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,519
lot of pre-sales and post-sales work

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,200
i play with lots of interesting cool new

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,960
technologies and

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,880
occasionally have to help people manage

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,879
incidents

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,719
over the last year i've learned a lot

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,960
i've seen a lot of environments

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,559
i've got domain admin and global admin

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,000
in more places that i care to think

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,719
about

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,079
thankfully i have a good password

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,600
manager and i use random passwords

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,199
everywhere

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,160
and there's a couple things i want to

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,079
talk about today because i know there's

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,640
a fair few defenders in the room

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,719
and because i love analogies and i'm a

31
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
little bit of a narcissist

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,239
i'm going to talk about those by talking

33
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
about my toyota corolla

34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,600
that's my corolla the best car in the

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,000
world

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
i bought my corolla back in 2012 because

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,760
my wife and i were expecting our first

38
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,320
child

39
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,640
um prior to that i owned a starlet and

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,400
as anyone who has ever owned a starlet

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,119
knows

42
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,439
one cannot simply fit a car seat in the

43
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,119
back of a starlet

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,280
um and so after trudging around auckland

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,040
for a day going from car yard to car

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,479
yard finding a whole bunch of different

47
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,119
things

48
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,640
i bought a corolla which is like a

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,799
bigger version of a starlet

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,759
it can do north 100 in some number of

51
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,960
seconds

52
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,720
i've never seen it on any of the top 10

53
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,040
prettiest cars list anywhere

54
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,600
it doesn't have car play or sat nav or

55
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
push button stop start

56
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
there the spare wheel is one of those

57
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,439
useless space savers

58
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,439
but i could fit a car seat in without

59
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,439
becoming a contortionist

60
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,040
it's one of the most reliable cars ever

61
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799
made which is important for me because

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,799
we don't have two

63
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,479
it's got a big enough boot to pack a

64
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,479
family size camping trip and it even has

65
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,840
a class one tow bar so i can take the

66
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,840
bikes

67
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
aren't using them correctly anyway

68
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
they're certainly not using all the

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,560
features

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,840
which leads to something that we often

71
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
talk about but we need to remind

72
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,199
ourselves about more

73
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,840
security is not just about the

74
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,199
technology people and processes play

75
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:07,840
equally

76
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
if not in more important roles because

77
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,360
technology by itself

78
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,880
never solved anything accidents happen

79
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,080
there's only so much you can do to

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
mitigate the impact but the impact of an

81
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,600
18 wheeler is still going to hurt

82
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
regardless of if you're in a corolla or

83
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,560
a hilux

84
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,800
instead of focusing purely on the safety

85
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,680
technology

86
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,199
are there things that you could be doing

87
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,680
to improve your your driving to minimize

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,840
the risk of that impact

89
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,280
do people in your organization know who

90
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,319
you are are they scared to bug you

91
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,039
because you're busy if something went

92
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,360
wrong

93
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
are they too afraid of being told that

94
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,600
it was a pebcak issue or an id10t

95
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
error because ha ha but building a

96
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,319
resilient organization means building

97
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,520
trust between people

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
so they can make mistakes and that's

99
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
okay because we can fix it together

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
how do you go about fixing it what about

101
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,160
your processes

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,360
how do you know you're taking full

103
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
advantage of the technology you have

104
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
how do you know you're maintaining it

105
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,039
properly are you doing things that are

106
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,919
risky

107
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,360
just because that's the way it's always

108
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
been done that server 2003 box you have

109
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,840
over in the corner didn't fall over

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,639
yesterday

111
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,080
but that doesn't mean that it's okay

112
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,680
that it's on the backlog

113
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,440
waiting for a spare moment to fix it at

114
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
some point in the foreseeable future

115
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,599
so instead of trying to map your product

116
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,360
set to mitre attack and worrying about

117
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
all hypothetical coverage points

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
to the minute detail spend your time

119
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,479
talking to your people improving your

120
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,759
processes

121
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,160
auditing your vulnerabilities test your

122
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
processes especially

123
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,919
backup restore and account compromise

124
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,440
what would you do if someone came to you

125
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
and says

126
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,080
i've got a problem i don't know what it

127
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
is i need you to help me fix it

128
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,360
show people how and why you use a

129
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,639
password manager

130
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,840
i'm assuming of course that everyone in

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,919
the room has a password manager if you

132
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:52,639
don't

133
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,199
or you don't know why come and talk to

134
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,160
someone me

135
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,879
for example i'm resisting the urge to

136
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,879
say make people in process great again

137
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,919
because i think there's been enough of

138
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,199
that but

139
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,960
sorry remember i said that most of you

140
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,639
probably have the right technology for

141
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,479
your needs but keep in mind that needs

142
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:10,960
change

143
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
and it's important to track your needs

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,400
against what you can deliver

145
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
covid was a great example of this

146
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
suddenly expectations for what security

147
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,240
meant

148
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,919
and how we needed to defend our systems

149
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,199
changed vpns are no longer the best way

150
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,319
to do things

151
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,080
you can't always rely on people even

152
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,160
using managed devices anymore

153
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,759
but that's okay because there's never

154
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,000
been a better time to be a defender

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,159
the mitre apt evaluations prove that

156
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,679
while there's no such thing as a perfect

157
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,719
security tool

158
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,120
all of them do a good enough job sure

159
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,240
there are differences in their

160
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
approaches and some

161
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
are stronger in some areas than others

162
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,360
but they all provide a good enough level

163
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,120
of protection for you to build on with

164
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,920
your good piece

165
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,519
with your good processes and your good

166
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
people

167
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
but if after improving your processes

168
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,720
and

169
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320
as best you can you still aren't getting

170
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,240
what you need you're in luck

171
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
because i've been lying to you that

172
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,040
is not my corolla it was but it's now

173
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
jenny's corolla

174
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
see last year my wife and i were

175
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
expecting our third child and as anyone

176
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
who's ever owned a corolla nose

177
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,000
one cannot simply fit a car seat in the

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,839
back sorry three car seats in the back

179
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,200
of a corolla

180
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,959
so i sold it and this was the trade me

181
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,560
picture

182
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
and that's my rav4 it's like a bigger

183
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,120
corolla which is like a bigger starlet

184
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,680
and so my final point recognize when

185
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,040
your needs have changed and you need to

186
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
make a change to accommodate it

187
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,839
but know what problem is that you're

188
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,720
trying to solve

189
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,399
so that you can claim explain it to

190
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,640
people clearly evaluate solutions

191
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,519
properly

192
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,200
implement it well and measure how

193
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
successful you've been

194
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,720
i've seen many a late night email come

195
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,560
at us looking for a solution to an

196
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
ill-described problem

197
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
it usually ends in tears if not at least

198
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
the budget blow out in a partially

199
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
undelivered project

200
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,920
also don't get distracted into thinking

201
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
that everything about your environment

202
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,959
needs to change

203
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
just to accommodate one change every

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
car i've owned has been dark blue

205
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
because i like dark blue cars

206
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,760
i don't need to change to burnt orange

207
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,279
just because that's now an available

208
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,120
option

209
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
if you feel you don't fully understand

210
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,959
what or how things need to change

211
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,959
that's okay too hopefully you have a

212
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
managed service provider who can

213
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,720
help and that you trust to give

214
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
impartial and good advice

215
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,880
you but you have friends if you look

216
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,640
around you everyone here

217
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,720
today is here because we we are

218
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,880
interested and passionate about security

219
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,320
and some of us are even old enough to

220
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,640
have scars of experience

221
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,959
talk to others explain what you're

222
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,079
thinking and ask for their advice

223
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,079
thank you if you think i'm wrong or

224
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,680
would like to talk further hit me up on

225
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,000
twitter

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
or email because i'm under time i've got

227
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,800
one bonus thing for you because it's

228
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,880
always a good idea to drop open source

229
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,480
tools at a security conference

230
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,320
if you're like me you probably had to

231
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
type a horrible long complicated

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
password or url into a sandbox where you

233
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,800
can't just copy and paste it

234
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,160
i had to do this enough that i actually

235
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,920
got motivated to write a very simple

236
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,959
small tool

237
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,800
it's up on github if you go to github

238
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
it's actually i

239
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,279
even went to the effort of putting it

240
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,200
into the windows store so that you don't

241
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,320
have to go through

242
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,480
the rigmarole of asking for a security

243
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,079
software exemption from your security

244
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,839
manager you know because asking yourself

245
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,800
for things is always hard

246
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,959
be safe look after each other and please

247
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,079
be proud of your toyota corolla thank

248
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,419
[Applause]

249
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839

250
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,240
