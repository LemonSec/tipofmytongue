1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,360
so

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,600
where are my beautiful assistants there

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,720
all right so um

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,240
you don't yet even know what you're

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,000
doing but you'll figure it out um

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so i'm not sure if anyone is familiar

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,719
with this

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
we're going to play a game i know that

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,840
not all of you went to university in

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,000
hamilton so hopefully you'll um

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,560
be familiar with never have i ever if

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,439
you're not it's

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,599
usually a drinking game where someone

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,359
says a thing that they've never done and

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,000
the people who

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,238
have done that thing will take a drink

17
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,640
but i didn't feel like passing a tequila

18
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,640
bottle around was very covert friendly

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
uh so instead

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,200
um with a spooky season after all we've

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,000
got some

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,559
halloween candy there which you can grab

23
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,399
some handfuls for

24
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,039
my lovely assistants will distribute it

25
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,480
around the room for you to grab some

26
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,280
handfuls of

27
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,160
um this technically there's no eating in

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,280
this building

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,800
um please be a tidy kiwi and

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,160
hide all your rapists and we'll pretend

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
we were never here

32
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,799
all right so this is a drinking game

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,600
about

34
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
security awareness everyone's favorite

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,840
topic for a friday afternoon

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,280
and i'm

37
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,080
uncannily asked to speak about security

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
awareness because i've been doing

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,119
security awareness training since before

40
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,200
security awareness was a thing

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,799
um i was a digital literacy librarian

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
decades ago for a long time

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
i used to teach teens how to

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,079
change all their privacy settings and

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,520
facebook and then i need to teach their

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,280
moms how to use facebook so that the

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,799
teams would have a reason to use

48
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,840
their knowledge about privacy settings

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,960
so i used that to leverage my way into

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,399
security which means that

51
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,840
i've done a lot of work in security

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,079
awareness

53
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,520
writing presenting i've been

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,159
involved in four different e-learning

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,799
products

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
i was even a voice-over artist for a red

57
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
panda once

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,239
so trust me when i say security

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,120
awareness

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
doesn't work which is not to say we

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,040
shouldn't do it i think it's more

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
important than ever

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
but the way we currently do it does not

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,360
protect us

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
from growing threats

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,319
security statistics are all nonsense and

67
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,560
made up by marketing departments but

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,120
generally speaking they all come out

69
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
around the same figure that somewhere

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
around 80 or 90

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
of security successful security

72
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
incidents are a result of

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,239
humans being exploited because people

74
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,000
are people they are vulnerable in very

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
special and interesting

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,560
ways and they will continue to be so and

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,080
people will continue to make it their

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,800
day job

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
to exploit that but the way we teach

80
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,319
security awareness is not keeping up

81
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,200
with this

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,560
growing uh growing threat

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,159
because we still do something that i

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,120
like to call no touchy fishy

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,640
i just need to live on that leave that

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,080
wrong enough for the best gift in the

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,400
world

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
what do i mean by no touchy fishy you'll

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
know it when you see it

90
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
especially if you've ever worked for a

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,040
university

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
yeah hot mess

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,319
you've probably seen some variant of

94
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,159
this in your life of the like just here

95
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,519
are some bad things if you spot any of

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,080
these bad things that's a bad sign

97
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,040
don't touch that email

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
the problem is that all of these things

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
that we're telling people are signs of

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,440
nefarious activity

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,560
are also quite often more often signs of

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,519
something

103
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,560
perfectly innocent and when you go

104
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
around telling people that things that

105
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,239
could be perfectly normal and safe are

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,680
actually signs of

107
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,720
some great conspiracy against them you

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,239
sound like

109
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
a conspiracy nut

110
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,159
so here is the drinking game has

111
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
everybody got some candy

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
did anyone grab a handful there all

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,599
right so

114
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,680
who here is prepared to say that never

115
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
have i ever

116
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
sent someone an email with a link in it

117
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,199
all right

118
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,959
now never have i ever

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,800
sent someone an email demanding that

120
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
they do something urgently

121
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
like i'm a consultant it's literally my

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,440
job to send people emails and say

123
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
can you do that thing please you said

124
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
you would do that thing can you please

125
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,039
do that thing

126
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,840
has anyone ever just sent out an email

127
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,320
never

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,840
have i ever sent an email with the typo

129
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,880
with some bad

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,000
grammar that got someone's name wrong

131
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,320
yeah these are things that we do all the

132
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,360
time and just telling people oh just

133
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
look out for those things if you spot

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
those things that sign of a baby

135
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,160
is useless because people see those all

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,199
the time and they get

137
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,880
used to those things being things that

138
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,680
people will do all the time

139
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,880
no touchy fishy doesn't work here's an

140
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,800
example

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
you know from a real security awareness

142
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,000
program of a real fake

143
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,880
email a real email out there telling

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,600
people

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
hi i'm from the dropbox i'm going to

146
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,639
shut your account if you don't click

147
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
this link it's very urgent

148
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,240
the problem is i've seen this email

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
before in my own inbox

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,320
from the real dropbox and if you didn't

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,400
have a side-by-side comparison if you

152
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,680
didn't know what to look like

153
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,400
look for would you really be able to

154
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,039
tell

155
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
the difference and it's got a link there

156
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,880
you know it's got this urgent click now

157
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
or lose everything it's terrible

158
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
in fact with this big scary bold text

159
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,479
they're telling you 15 yes

160
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,080
i think this one actually kind of is a

161
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
bit more of a scammy vibe than the fake

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
one

163
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,680
and you know i know what to look for

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,039
i've seen the security awareness

165
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,000
training and i know

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,479
that you know

167
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,440
real people out there don't know the

168
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
difference between a cdn

169
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
link and a bad link yeah they don't know

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,039
the difference between oh it's not

171
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,039
coming from the right sender and

172
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,720
oh we just couldn't get mailchimp to

173
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,560
work properly so we just kind of use

174
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,000
this other thing from our other domain

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,560
they don't know

176
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
the difference and they so they slowly

177
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,880
learn over time that i don't worry about

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
that that's probably fine

179
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
because real companies i see are doing

180
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
that all the time

181
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
so the way that we're teaching people

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,639
security awareness doesn't

183
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,919
work because they can't

184
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,759
tell what to do with the information

185
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,680
we're giving them

186
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,360
and blaming them for not getting it

187
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
saying that ah the user is stupid it's a

188
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,639
peb cake error

189
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,240
it doesn't help them to improve their

190
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
behavior

191
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,880
the good news is that we can change

192
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,599
behavior

193
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,319
we can make security actionable

194
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,960
we just need to change the way that we

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,639
do it and we need to start by well

196
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,440
actually

197
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,000
we need to stop doing security awareness

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,120
because awareness

199
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
is a very small part of learning and

200
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,680
it's only the first part

201
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
knowing is the start you need to build

202
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,120
on that knowledge

203
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,800
and get to the point that people are

204
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,720
able to action it

205
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,919
change their behavior

206
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,160
and i'm not going to dwell on this

207
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,280
because it's meant to be a lightning

208
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,840
talk and this is meant to be fun

209
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,759
and but there's a lot of different

210
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,880
things you can do to create an

211
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,280
environment where people

212
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,479
can build on their learning and put it

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:34,880
into

214
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
action change their behavior in ways

215
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
that will ultimately make your

216
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,199
organization more secure which is

217
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,120
actually the goal of security awareness

218
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
training

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,319
and i want to rush through a few of them

220
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,639
i don't want to dwell on them but

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,919
just a look a couple of the things that

222
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
we can do in security awareness programs

223
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,840
to make them better to make them

224
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,560
actionable

225
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
we can make it safe to make mistakes and

226
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,479
i'm not just talking about psychological

227
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,039
safety

228
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,599
although that's very important please

229
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,720
make sure that you're not too hungover

230
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,080
so that you can come see sarah's talk

231
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,360
tomorrow morning

232
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,840
about creating cultures where it is safe

233
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,639
it's going to be awesome uh i'm also

234
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,919
talking about creating environment with

235
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
the technical tools that you have

236
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,319
um so that the people aren't the last

237
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,680
line of defense they're the first line

238
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,039
of defense but you've got other things

239
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,599
in there they're gonna

240
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,520
tell if they did open that email or

241
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,879
click on that link or put in their

242
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,479
details and try to

243
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
minimize the impact of that

244
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,919
and when you've got those tools in place

245
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
people should know about

246
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,240
the tool catching a thing we should

247
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
actually be giving them that feedback in

248
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,040
real time

249
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
they say oh oh okay that watch that one

250
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,720
there that i saw then

251
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
was a scam and i did get caught out by

252
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,399
it

253
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,160
cool now i know what to look like

254
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,519
instead of look for instead of one

255
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,360
that's the abstract example

256
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,600
in that training that i do once a year

257
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,640
this needs to be something that people

258
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,839
are practicing

259
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
in little incremental bits all the time

260
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,240
so that they get the hang of it we need

261
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
to treat people

262
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,519
as more than just users i don't really

263
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,600
like that word we use it a lot

264
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,519
i find myself using it even though i try

265
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,959
very hard not to

266
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,399
um and part of this is the corollary of

267
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,240
people need lots of practice to get good

268
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,040
at things is people

269
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,240
also need rest they can't be constantly

270
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
bombarded and they can't be constantly

271
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
demanded

272
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,680
you need to be hyper vigilant threats

273
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,560
all the time

274
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,640
and if you're not it's going to be

275
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,399
terrible and everything is going to go

276
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,920
wrong and it's your fault

277
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,519
that's not a conducive environment for

278
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,920
learning so

279
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,839
use the tools that are available to you

280
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,959
to reduce

281
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,680
the number of those it's so obvious even

282
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
a computer can spot it

283
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,839
scammy emails that people receive that

284
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,120
websites they might be exposed to

285
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,640
but also if there's one thing we can all

286
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,920
do that doesn't require any fancy

287
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,560
tooling

288
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,839
as part of our security awareness

289
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,040
training

290
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,680
it is this okay here is some advice

291
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,279
i don't know if anyone recognizes this

292
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,160
does anyone remember around middle of

293
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,640
this very long year when new zealand

294
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
police announced that they'd had

295
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,480
a breach with a third party provider

296
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,160
that they'd used for some

297
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,800
market data and they put up this advice

298
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,839
and it's good advice

299
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,640
like i don't think there's anything

300
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,880
necessarily wrong with this advice the

301
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,640
reason that this particular

302
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,519
press release got lightly mocked is that

303
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,760
it came out literally two days after

304
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,120
this article in which it had been railed

305
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
that new zealand police had

306
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
sent an email to everyone on the

307
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,839
firearms license database saying hi

308
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,279
police here random firearms holder can

309
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,000
you please send us an email that says

310
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,079
what guns you have where are the guns

311
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,680
how are they secured

312
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,040
you know um love

313
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,839
the police p.s this is definitely us um

314
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,760
and to their credit a lot of

315
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
farmers got this email and alerted new

316
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,959
zealand police to it by ringing up 105

317
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,519
and saying

318
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,560
hey i think you've been hacked

319
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,399
and i mean i'm not i don't want to pick

320
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,920
on new zealand please with this example

321
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,760
because this is a really common thing

322
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,680
organizations that are definitely doing

323
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
security awareness training

324
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
like microsoft i'm sure that

325
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,720
the staff at microsoft maybe sarah can

326
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,279
tell me

327
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,279
get some security awareness training

328
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,200
once a year that will have some things

329
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
in it like

330
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,279
legitimate companies will never send you

331
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,040
an email with some generic greeting

332
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,560
i'm sure that ird are giving all their

333
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,160
staff annual training that's telling

334
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,760
them

335
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,440
don't trust a message that comes from a

336
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
random address in fact they have tips on

337
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,399
their website they're like you know spot

338
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:48,880
a scam

339
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880

telling them never downloaded anything

358
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,440
you don't know where it's been

359
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,680
and i mean banks definitely i'm getting

360
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,040
security awareness training because the

361
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
pci council is saying hey

362
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,079
we've got a box we want you to check it

363
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,839
give everyone training once a year and

364
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,279
tell them to look out for suspicious

365
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,160
things and

366
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
you know the staff there are giving

367
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,519
people advice like don't use password

368
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,639
managers it's bad because it means

369
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,839
you're writing passwords down

370
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,200
yep i don't want to mock any of these

371
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,079
people

372
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,920
who sent these messages because they

373
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,279
were trying their best

374
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,800
because whoever is in charge of that

375
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,399
security awareness program did not turn

376
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,920
around and say okay

377
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,120
you're not just users we need to train

378
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,959
you as the people who are

379
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
creating the content sending the

380
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,040
messages to not do the things that we

381
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
are telling people that legitimate

382
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
companies would never do

383
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,880
if we want to help people to spot

384
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,800
the real scams in a way that's not going

385
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,839
to

386
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:21,839
overwhelm and consume them and turn them

387
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,760
into lunatic conspiracy that's like

388
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,959
us we need to

389
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,839
start teaching them to not send these

390
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,200
messages that's one thing we can do as

391
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,120
part of the security awareness programs

392
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
that

393
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,320
maybe we're providing them or

394
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,639
contributing to the content of them or

395
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,680
recommending that other people do

396
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,639
as consultants this is one thing we can

397
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,680
all do differently

398
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
right now to make the world a more

399
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
secure place

400
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,839
to help people to reduce the false

401
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,680
positives that make people

402
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
a little bit complacent and make it a

403
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,839
little bit harder people spot the scams

404
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,800
amid

405
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
the real emails in their inbox so that's

406
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,959
my only takeaway

407
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,079
that i want to leave with today apart

408
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,920
from

409
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,240
please be a tidy poo echo

410
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:30,959
thank you all

411
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,040
you
