1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:04,960
sweet

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,200
awesome um yeah thank you so much for

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,720
the warm welcome definitely like

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,200
huge shout outs for the chicon crew for

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,639
for making this work when they said they

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,920
were going to be remote talks

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
i um i kind of i submitted partially

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:17,520
just

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,880
they're going to see what happened but i

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,160
i honestly figured they would get so

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,960
many like

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,640
dynamite live submissions that i'd get

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
like a a polite thanks but no thanks and

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,240
then they got back to me to be like

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,599
nope we still want you to do it and i

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,439
was like oh christ now i

17
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,800
have to do it um if you haven't met me

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,399
before my name is richo um they're right

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,320
i did run a couple cons in christchurch

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,920
although one of them was

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
i mean one was low-key and one was super

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,079
impressively low-key

23
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,120
um but anyway i'm here today to uh talk

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,840
to you

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
talk to what feels like an empty room

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
which is incredibly bizarre

27
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,960
uh but i'm gonna talk quite a bit about

28
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,559
base jumping which i think is

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,239
sort of an intuitively intuitively

30
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,000
obvious subject for

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,960
uh a hackathon uh and i'm gonna try and

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,239
defend the thesis

33
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,120
that my day job and tossing myself off

34
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,239
of a bridge is

35
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,240
basically the same thing with no like

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
meaningful distinction

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,000
um cool my next slide button what there

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,560
we go

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,640
um so this is like probably the best

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,680
content warning

41
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,000
i'll ever get to give in my whole life

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,280
um so this

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
does have like some pictures and videos

44
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
of people doing rad stuff

45
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,880
um mostly jumping off stuff it also does

46
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,479
have some shots of things not going

47
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:26,880
great

48
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,759
um no one involved in any of this was

49
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,280
seriously injured or killed in fact

50
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,960
miraculously no one was even kind of

51
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,600
hurt

52
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,920
um but i wanted to at least like make

53
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
sure that the warning is out there

54
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,680
um that there is some content that's i

55
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,439
guess a little bit rough to watch

56
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,280
um all the videos have kind of a lead in

57
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
so if you if you want to look away

58
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,520
you'll like

59
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,520
um have your chance i think the flip

60
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
side of that is that there's also

61
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,479
like a 30 chance you'll get to see one

62
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,920
of my cats which is something you don't

63
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,360
get at every security con

64
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,079
which i think is kind of neat um and

65
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,719
finally

66
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,520
there's also kind of like a fairly

67
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
detailed depiction of some crimes

68
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,399
um and i'm gonna do my best to not go

69
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,240
into much detail or incriminate myself

70
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,640
but

71
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,479
if i do please don't let me go full ammo

72
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
uh cool so like who am i um i've been

73
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,200
doing computer security stuff for 10

74
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
years which i actually realized as i was

75
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,319
riding this slide which is sort of

76
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,200
horrifying

77
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
um i work at a company called lightstep

78
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,480
now if you need barrels of distributed

79
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
tracing hit us up

80
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,760
uh i do some open source stuff um i

81
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,800
actually sort of

82
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,959
forgot that i ran a couple cons until

83
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,040
the intro so yeah i did wrong allen khan

84
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,760
a few times

85
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,920
um i've actually been kind of debating

86
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,120
another one so

87
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,640
uh nag me if that's the kind of thing

88
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,239
you want to see and those are my social

89
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,000
media things if you want to see them

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,840
uh but i guess like more relevantly to

91
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,519
this talk is

92
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,640
um what i do for giggles on the side um

93
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
so i'm an aerobatic pilot i actually

94
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,080
just got my instrument rating last week

95
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,920
which is super useless when all you do

96
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,840
is flips uh but that's me flying my

97
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,120
airplane upside down

98
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
um i'm a skydiver i have about 3 000

99
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,239
skydives

100
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,319
um specifically i'm a canopy pilot i

101
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,840
competed at the world cup of canopy

102
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,959
piloting in 2019 representing australia

103
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,440
i'm a base jumper i have about 250 base

104
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
jumps or so

105
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
um i'm hashtag sponsored which is

106
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,480
clearly the the end goal for all of

107
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,200
these things

108
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,879
um i speed fly i'm a senior rigger i

109
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
used to race motorcycles

110
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,959
i do a lot of i i mean i feel like i do

111
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,159
a lot of stuff

112
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
um and a lot of people would kind of

113
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
look at this risk and want to label me

114
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
as an an adrenaline junkie

115
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,159
which i don't like really really take

116
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,560
issue

117
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,480
with but i i think it's like pretty

118
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,400
i think it's just misleading right

119
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
because my goal

120
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,760
with all of these you know super

121
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,200
ridiculous white people sports that i'm

122
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,239
involved in

123
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,720
is to go out and and do awesome stuff

124
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
and and definitely like push limits and

125
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,159
find out what's possible

126
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:49,680
but you know i'm also interested in

127
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
continuing to do that

128
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,080
um and you know if you die it'll really

129
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
kind of meaningfully impact your ability

130
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,319
to

131
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,040
to do more rad right and so i kind

132
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,000
of like reject

133
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,159
this hypothesis that that people do

134
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,439
these things you know

135
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,599
to experience nearly dying for you know

136
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,799
for the rush or whatever

137
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,799
um i i feel like the reason to do these

138
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,080
things is so that you can

139
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,599
go and do more of them um

140
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,680
cool so i mean this is like half a talk

141
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
about base jumping

142
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
and half a talk about security um i'm

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,399
gonna

144
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,160
tell you kind of the bare minimum amount

145
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
of bass jumping stuff that you need to

146
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,960
know to get through this

147
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,919
um so kind of bear with me so like what

148
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,400
is

149
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
base jumping so base stands for building

150
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,360
antenna span earth um spans are bridges

151
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
that's not obvious i guess they already

152
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
had a b in the acronym and babe jumping

153
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
wasn't super appealing to them

154
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
um but basically like i i think the

155
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,800
easiest way to put it is

156
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,160
if you jumped out of an airplane of some

157
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,680
kind you're skydiving and if you toss

158
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,199
yourself off a solid object

159
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,120
you're base jumping um another really

160
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,880
common definition is if it's possible to

161
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,080
hit the object

162
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,520
you're base jumping um base jumping was

163
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
pioneered by carl burnish way back in

164
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,199
the day like in the in the late 70s

165
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,039
um if you document having jumped one

166
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,560
of each kind of object and write a

167
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,919
letter to this dude called regards and

168
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,560
you get a number

169
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,199
minus 2091 um and so the implication is

170
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,039
that i'm the 2091st

171
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,199
person to have jumped all four kinds of

172
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,080
objects

173
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,240
um i think that's obviously not true

174
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,360
like tons of people do it and don't

175
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,199
write the letter but it's kind of a

176
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,080
fun little piece of history um and so

177
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
what is hopefully the last little piece

178
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,479
of like

179
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,520
i i guess like base jumping or minutiae

180
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,560
for a hot second is

181
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,759
is how does a parachute work because

182
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,039
it's going to kind of become relevant in

183
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,919
a second

184
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,520
um so when we're base jumping we fly

185
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
what's called a ram air parachute

186
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,000
um when a lot of people think of

187
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
parachutes they think of a big round

188
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,759
thing probably with a little hole in the

189
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,080
top bunch of um

190
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
you know bunch of string going up to it

191
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,199
it's conceptually the same as tossing

192
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,400
yourself off a roof with an umbrella

193
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
which i'm sure a lot of us did when we

194
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,639
were kids

195
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,199
um brown parachutes are like

196
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,400
they still exist but they're just

197
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
horrific they're super bad they're

198
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,280
steerable in the sense that you get to

199
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,479
choose which way you're facing when you

200
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,680
cream into the ground

201
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,759
and so these days we use what's called a

202
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,000
ramp parachute so it's rectangular it

203
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
actually forms like an aerodynamic wing

204
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,039
it has a lift vector it does the whole

205
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,000
thing

206
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,440
but instead of being rigid like an

207
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,880
airplane's wing which is made out of

208
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
metal or fabric

209
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,720
um it's made of nylon and interior air

210
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
pressure is what keeps it inflated and

211
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,960
keeps it

212
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,319
being a win off the back of my parachute

213
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,520
this is a picture of me flying my

214
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
parachute in twin falls idaho um

215
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,520
the back of my parachute you can see uh

216
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
another smaller parachute which is round

217
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,280
and shitty um it's called a pilot shoot

218
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,000
and when you

219
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
when you execute a base jump you throw

220
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120
the pilot chute

221
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
the pilot shoot catches air it drags

222
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,120
your main parachute out of the container

223
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
when you get to the end of your lines it

224
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,240
inflates and now you're

225
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,600
you're probably going to live um

226
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,199
but yeah that's that's kind of the gist

227
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,800
of it base drumming is super simple the

228
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,080
gear is really straightforward there's

229
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,360
only one parachute so you don't have to

230
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,960
deal with cutting away and stuff

231
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,319
um super straightforward

232
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,759
so i think i'm just going to get this

233
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,199
like gimme out of the way because i feel

234
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,639
like no talk about base jumping would be

235
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,919
complete without it

236
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,120
i'm sure when you're a kid your parents

237
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,639
asked you like if your friends all

238
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,080
jumped off a bridge like would you jump

239
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,120
off it as well

240
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,400
um and for me personally the answer is

241
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,120
absolutely um so this is twin falls

242
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,680
idaho

243
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,120
um i feel like this is what everyone

244
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,199
came here to see um this is the only

245
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,080
object that's legal

246
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,000
to jump in the u.s neat little

247
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,520
flippy-doo

248
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,759
parachutes opening bitchin time high

249
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,880
fives all around

250
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,759
um if you actually keep watching uh i

251
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,680
land about a meter away from that little

252
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,360
bridge which is what i was landing or

253
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,080
trying to land

254
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,440
on um which i guess like in a context

255
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,000
that that

256
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,520
probably seems pretty close but in the

257
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
broader context of base jumping like if

258
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,039
you just look at this landing area

259
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,240
we're off to the side there's like

260
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,599
boulders there's trees there's all kinds

261
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,319
of

262
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,639
um being able to land super accurately

263
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,759
is actually like

264
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,840
pretty crucial to to kind of

265
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
successfully executing it

266
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,599
um but for everyone in the audience if

267
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,560
you

268
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,120
um have never seen a bass drum before

269
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,039
now you can say that you have

270
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,879
um all right box checked

271
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
but this is meant to be you talk about

272
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,000
security or at least like have just

273
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
enough parallel to justify itself as one

274
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,800
and i think we've all heard um yeah

275
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
we've heard the expression it's not life

276
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
and death um

277
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,199
probably in a professional context as

278
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,720
well and it's something that gets thrown

279
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,360
around a ton

280
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,000
and i i think like for the most part i

281
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
mean it's accurate right like very

282
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,240
little

283
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
very very little that i've ever had to

284
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
do in a professional context that has

285
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,199
been a matter of life and death

286
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,160
um but for me personally at least a lot

287
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,280
of the choices that i make in my

288
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,879
personal life literally are

289
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,839
um as an faa parachute rigger i i'm

290
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,039
privileged to pack other people's

291
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,760
reserves

292
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
reserve parachutes and so those people

293
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,640
are literally putting their lives in my

294
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,360
hands

295
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
um and and i think it does give you a

296
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,958
really valuable perspective

297
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
a for for i guess like what really

298
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,080
matters

299
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
um but also for for how you should

300
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
manage risk and how you should be

301
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,240
thinking about it in in the broader

302
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,279
context

303
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,040
and so one thing that i think you can

304
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,320
take away from this is

305
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
the next time you're you're making a

306
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
decision um in

307
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,360
in a professional context like stop and

308
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
ask yourself whether or not you would

309
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,920
have enough

310
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,920
confidence in your decision to bet your

311
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,040
life on it

312
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,360
um because it's something that people do

313
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,040
on a day-to-day basis which is

314
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,399
sort of weird to think about it still

315
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,160
kind of trips me out some days

316
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,160
um but i mean it sort of is like a

317
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
really bizarre position to find yourself

318
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,080
in and so i think as security

319
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,200
practitioners

320
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,279
it's really really easy to fall into the

321
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,920
trap of always reaching for the safest

322
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,600
thing or i guess the lowest risk

323
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,399
thing um and that's kind of like i guess

324
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,000
reasonable in isolation

325
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,120
but if i were to apply that ethos to my

326
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
personal life

327
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,120
you know i would have to give up

328
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
skydiving base jumping or definitely

329
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,480
stop flying small airplanes

330
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,000
probably stop running a motorcycle all

331
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
right i have to give up so much that i

332
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,800
love

333
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,480
um and at that point i'd probably be

334
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,240
asking myself what's the point

335
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
right and so it comes back to this thing

336
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,519
where i mean that the goal is to do rad

337
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:53,920


338
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,480
and that's what i try and keep in mind

339
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
in my professional life

340
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,959
is that my goal you know my function as

341
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,399
a security person like working for a

342
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,519
tech startup

343
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,680
isn't to like say no to as much as i

344
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,279
think i can get away with i mean my goal

345
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,120
is to help the oil do as like

346
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
much rad as humanly possible but do

347
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,120
it in a way that's sustainable right

348
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,959
like if you teach yourself to base jump

349
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,399
by buying a rig off ebay and tossing

350
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,480
yourself off the nearest bridge like

351
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,760
i don't want to ruin the surprise but

352
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,800
you're probably not going to get to do a

353
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,160
whole lot of bass jumps

354
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,000
um same kind of thing when you're

355
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,360
approaching rips in a professional

356
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,079
context

357
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,440
you know i mean you want to do rad

358
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,519
in a way that will let you do more rad

359
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,800
 instead of

360
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
explaining yourself to the sec or um you

361
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,200
know looking for a new job really

362
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,120
hastily

363
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,360
so uh i i figured the best way to to

364
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,279
kind of like relay this experience

365
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,040
uh is i'm gonna tell you a tale of two

366
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,279
base jumps um

367
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,800
and one of them actually took place in

368
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,560
new zealand which is pretty neat

369
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,600
um so there's this pretty cool bridge um

370
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
it's somewhat famous um i'm gonna do my

371
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,920
best to

372
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,519
remember to use the third person for

373
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,440
this whole thing because i'm telling you

374
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,640
about a crime

375
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
um but so there's this pretty famous

376
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
bridge about halfway up the north island

377
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
um i i think a lot of people have

378
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,399
actually gone over it um it's like a

379
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:10,959
there's a

380
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,120
passenger train kind of situation that

381
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,160
you like spend

382
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
a day or so on a train and you go over a

383
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,200
bunch of fancy bridges including this

384
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,240
one

385
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,320
um and so this is the story of someone

386
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,480
who's not me uh and his buddy steve

387
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,240
who decided that it would be a really

388
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,839
good idea to toss themselves off this

389
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,880
bridge

390
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
so this is what the the bridge looks

391
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,720
like from the top

392
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,000
hang on i think there's some way that i

393
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,480
can get a cursor to point at things with

394
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,839
oh jesus or maybe not oh god

395
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,839
here's where the technical ah

396
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,160
okay close enough all right so what

397
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,680
happened is i also don't have a cursor

398
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,399
so i'm gonna be

399
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,000
like feeling this out normally this is

400
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,440
where a smarter person would use a laser

401
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,399
pointer

402
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839
um so my where are we oh god

403
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,839
this is going great so this is this is

404
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,680
where um the party left

405
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,279
their car uh with one of their

406
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,120
girlfriends in it um who probably went

407
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,320
back to sleep

408
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,399
took the car all the way around this

409
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,560
like big windy road

410
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,200
came around the other side um peeled off

411
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,120
into this kind of big scrubby

412
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,600
grassland here and one of the few really

413
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,440
genuinely great decisions that got made

414
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,320
that day

415
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,200
was uh turning the car around right so

416
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,639
it was facing out

417
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,600
um so that they wouldn't have to do like

418
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,760
an aggressive three-point turn on what

419
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,120
is basically a swamp

420
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,320
in a shitty frontal drive rental car

421
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
um i guess like in in the broader

422
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,800
context of like figuring out whether or

423
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,639
not this jump was a good idea

424
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,399
um we have to talk a little bit about

425
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,160
like the minutiae of base jumping again

426
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,240
so the i guess like the most important

427
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,519
or not the most important but

428
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,519
easily one of the most important things

429
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,440
about scoping out a bass jump

430
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,120
is oh great now my slides don't go

431
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,720
forward that's there we go

432
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,399
uh really

433
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,680
clear yeah all right so how big is the

434
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,079
object

435
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,760
is like the first question that ever

436
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
gets asked when when you're

437
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,639
deciding whether or not you're going to

438
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,480
fling yourself off something

439
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,160
all right and so you remember that

440
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,519
picture i showed you earlier with the

441
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,279
parachute and the the smaller parachute

442
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,519
hanging off the back

443
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,800
how fast you're going to be going when

444
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,279
you deploy directly changes

445
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
everything about the jump right so if

446
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,480
the object is really small

447
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,519
um like 150 feet is like pretty short

448
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,560
for a bass jump

449
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,000
instead of using that little parachute

450
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,760
as a parachute you literally attach the

451
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,600
bridle which is the the length of chord

452
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,959
that attaches the two parachutes

453
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:37,680
together

454
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,600
you attach it to the object right with

455
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,920
some break code that snaps at 25 pounds

456
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,160
and then you jump off it pulls you all

457
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,519
the way until your lines are taut and

458
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,959
then it breaks and lets you go

459
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,880
right so for for really really small

460
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
objects um 150 feet is kind of about as

461
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,720
low as most people go without

462
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,079
specialized equipment

463
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,760
um you're using a static line or someone

464
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,360
else is holding your pilot chute use a

465
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,120
huge pilot shoe just in case it fails

466
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,560
you really set yourself up for success

467
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
trying to open like as high as possible

468
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
then there's this like 150 to 300 foot

469
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,199
uh i guess like

470
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,040
no man's land where you actually you

471
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
hold the pilot shoot so you don't

472
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,160
have it in a pocket you don't have to

473
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,839
throw it you you have it in your hand

474
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,279
you get off the object you throw it as

475
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,199
hard as you can and then your parachute

476
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,240
opens

477
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,760
and then once you get above about 300

478
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,680
feet um you can start to go what's

479
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,800
called stove so you have the

480
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
the pilot shoe kind of wrapped up tucked

481
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,160
into this pocket on your back

482
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,839
um and then when you're ready to use it

483
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,279
you reach back take it out of the pocket

484
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,000
and throw it

485
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
and i guess to give you some idea of

486
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,680
scale um this is a 42 inch pile shoot

487
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
right and it's like

488
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,680
it's big and this is a i guess a medium

489
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,800
sized pilot shoe

490
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,399
so it's a pretty substantial amount of

491
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,920
fabric that you're trying to deal with

492
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,079
um and that too will become relevant to

493
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,440
the story and then eventually

494
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,279
you get into genuinely big objects like

495
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,720
600 foot plus

496
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,000
um where you're you're taking long

497
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,279
delays that's kind of long enough that

498
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,880
you could fly a wingsuit off it

499
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,480
um and you start using really really

500
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,680
small pilot shoots because you're going

501
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,399
to be going

502
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,680
fast as hell when you get there so

503
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,440
oh god uh this is an oddest rendition of

504
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
the object in question

505
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
um obviously the auto sync question is

506
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,199
is super good at this

507
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,560
um but so it's 250 feet right which is

508
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
that first question that we ask it's

509
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
like how big is the object

510
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,240
but the answer can be misleading in this

511
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,839
case it's a bridge

512
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,240
over a very sharp valley and so while it

513
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,720
is 250 feet to the bottom

514
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,399
as soon as you start getting offset from

515
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,839
the bottom it starts getting short

516
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,519
really really quickly

517
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,360
um you know potentially short enough

518
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,720
that that it's not

519
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,639
enough room to like successfully execute

520
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,920
a bass jump

521
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
the walls of the canyon also just

522
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,680
present hazard right your parachute is

523
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,959
meant to open on heading

524
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,880
but if it opens facing left or right and

525
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,399
you just fly straight into the side of

526
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,120
the cliff

527
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,000
it's uh it's not going to feel very good

528
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,920
and finally at the bottom of this

529
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,800
particular valley there's pretty nasty

530
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,079
looking rapids at least they

531
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,160
they really didn't look good that day um

532
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,000
and so the expectation is probably that

533
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,519
if you land in the rapids you're in

534
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,680
a lot of trouble um maybe you'll survive

535
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
that i don't know that i'd be like super

536
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,440
excited about the idea

537
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,160
i guess the last thing is bridges are

538
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
regarded as being i guess the safest

539
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,800
object

540
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,240
because you can't hit them right like if

541
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
you imagine a normal bridge kind of

542
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,399
looks like this there's nothing in the

543
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,519
middle to hit

544
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,680
um but this bridge had a ton of support

545
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,800
towers or pillars

546
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,160
right and so if you slam into the

547
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,160
pillars it's gonna feel

548
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,399
extremely not good um and so at the very

549
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,839
bottom kind of off to one side of the

550
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,360
rapids there was a little like

551
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
gravel spit kind of situation

552
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,320
um which represented like the only good

553
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,040
place to land um and so i guess like if

554
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,720
if i were to use my uh my grand old like

555
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,880
rating scale for this jump you know this

556
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,199
is like four out of ten scaries

557
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,199
um you know it's not it's not super

558
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,519
duper on it was kind of

559
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,279
a lot of things working in our favor but

560
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
it was definitely a somewhat technical

561
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,839
jump

562
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,480
um with a fair bit to think about and

563
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
looking back on when this took place

564
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,839
you know i mean at the time when this

565
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,680
happened i didn't have that many bass

566
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
jumps right and so i didn't have a

567
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,959
really calibrated sense of risk and i

568
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,359
didn't

569
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,959
have all the tools that i needed to

570
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,520
really understand the risk that i was

571
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,559
taking on

572
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,720
when i committed to well once i'm more

573
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,199
committed to doing this job

574
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,359
so i'm going to talk for a second longer

575
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,039
because as soon as i flip to the next

576
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,720
slide you're probably gonna figure out

577
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,760
what happened

578
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,439
um so on that fateful morning you know

579
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,119
the two jumpers parked the

580
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,919
rental car um went up to the top of the

581
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:28,640
bridge

582
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,200
um in this case they'd spoken to someone

583
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
else who jumped it and they gave them

584
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,120
what's

585
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
called in base jumping circles beta um

586
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
climbers use the same term

587
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,760
and it's basically if you've done

588
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,200
something before you tell other people

589
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
about your experience and you'll be like

590
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,360
hey

591
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
um you know this is where you want to

592
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,799
park this is how the hike out works

593
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,240
if the cops show up this is a good place

594
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,160
to hide whatever it may be it's all the

595
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,760
information that you can give someone to

596
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
help them be more successful

597
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
and with 2020 hindsight the people or

598
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,280
the person that these jumpers got their

599
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
beta from

600
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,480
was not as reliable as they potentially

601
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,679
could have been

602
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,799
so um they climbed up to the top um got

603
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,160
to kind of the edge where you're

604
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
officially like on a railway bridge

605
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,720
and you know that thing in the movies

606
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,320
where you stick your ear against the

607
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
train track and if there's a train

608
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
coming the train tracks will vibrate and

609
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,360
train tracks conduct sound so putting

610
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,640
your ear against the thing

611
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,840
will clue you into whether or not a

612
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
train is coming

613
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,799
that doesn't work it is the short

614
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,919
version of this story

615
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,960
right um the the jumpers in question

616
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,679
got a hold of that passenger schedule um

617
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,160
and so

618
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,080
like knew for a fact that there were no

619
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,679
passenger trains scheduled

620
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,440
um they sort of looked for the freight

621
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,440
train schedule it seemed

622
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,679
i i think at the time it was pretty easy

623
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,960
to write off they were really struggling

624
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,080
to figure it out

625
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,880
um and considering that it was super

626
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
early we'd slept like crap

627
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,160
um i had kind of forgotten that new

628
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,880
zealand gets

629
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,000
quite cold in november um and so when i

630
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,360
realized i was gonna be sleeping in my

631
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,080
car

632
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,640
i bought uh i went to some shitty corner

633
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,679
store and i bought

634
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,440
all the snuggies they had because that

635
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
was the only warm thing they had which

636
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,240
was true

637
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,000
and kind of realizing my mistake i also

638
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,280
bought all of their towels thinking

639
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,440
that's like basically a blanket

640
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,799
and so i was already off to a really

641
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,960
roaring start right i slept like crap

642
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
i was super duper cold and i just wanted

643
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,799
to i guess they

644
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
just wanted to get this thing done right

645
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,880
so ear to the train track

646
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,720
it's not vibrating great there's no

647
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,559
possible way that a train is coming

648
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,840
uh walk out onto the bridge and so like

649
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,360
we discussed like the

650
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,400
the canyon is like a v right and so

651
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,600
the the closer to the middle you go the

652
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,039
safer this base jump is going to be um

653
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,320
and like i've been alluding to like

654
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,760
there's no such thing as a safe base

655
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,480
jump but you're

656
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,160
out of your skull if you don't stack the

657
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,760
deck in your favor and try to make them

658
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
as safe as possible

659
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
so they're they're wandering out they

660
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,240
walk into the middle of this thing um

661
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
there's a super technical base jumping

662
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,520
move that you use to figure out

663
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,720
what the winds are doing where you just

664
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,000
spit off the object and see where your

665
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,039
spit goes

666
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,960
um so they're spitting away happily kind

667
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,480
of watching the winds um

668
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,880
the winds were fine they were going it

669
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,400
was blowing but it was like straight

670
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
down the canyon which is like

671
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,000
kind of the the best thing they could be

672
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,520
doing in context

673
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
um only the meeting's being upgraded by

674
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,679
the host and now includes unlimited

675
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,480
minutes that's

676
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,600
really good news if you want to hear the

677
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,080
end of this so wandering out onto the

678
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,480
bridge

679
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
spitting off the thing um already kind

680
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
of getting excited for how awesome this

681
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,280
is gonna be

682
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,799
um because you know it's an iconic

683
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,320
bridge and tossing yourself off stuff is

684
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,960
super cool

685
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,440
so wandering out doing the thing uh and

686
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,120
and as i remember it

687
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,240
um steve looks up and says is that a

688
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,039
train

689
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,520
uh and the other jumping question looks

690
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,559
up and says

691
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,360
i'm gonna paraphrase that yup i think

692
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,559
that's a train

693
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,280
uh and in that moment there was a pretty

694
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,120
serious decision to be made

695
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,799
and i will say like

696
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,240
i there's very little that i like

697
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
haven't filmed in my career

698
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,880
um of like doing ridiculous

699
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,120
that i really genuinely had regret of

700
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,760
but i regret this one um this this a

701
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
would be a great teaching aid but b

702
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
it would just be super cool footage so

703
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,480
there's now this train

704
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,559
hauling off of these two people and they

705
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,080
have a decision to make right do you

706
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,240
toss yourself off the bridge having

707
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,360
given up a lot of the

708
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,799
i guess the safety that was cooked into

709
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,480
this which is the the option to make a

710
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,440
decision about whether or not you're

711
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,080
doing it

712
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
or do you find out if you can run faster

713
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
than a train uh

714
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,360
and the punchline to this is that every

715
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,200
second you're contemplating what thing

716
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,559
you're gonna do you're like

717
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,080
losing valuable running away from a

718
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,159
train seconds

719
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,880
right and so you know back to this

720
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
picture of the bridge right we

721
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,240
had no idea if we're near the center i

722
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,840
mean we had some idea that

723
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,799
the plan was to line ourselves up pretty

724
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,559
well with it um

725
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,320
didn't have a great sense of exactly how

726
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
fast the train was going it's

727
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,760
difficult to figure out how long it's

728
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,120
going to take before something gets to

729
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,760
you

730
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
and the junk was pretty much predicated

731
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,840
on having a clean and stable exit right

732
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,320
like

733
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,799
if you leave kind of with your

734
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,600
together

735
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
and you leave symmetrical your chances

736
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,480
of having a really good opening in an

737
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,280
uneventful kind of

738
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
rider a lot better if you toss yourself

739
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,400
head first over a rail because you're

740
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,080
concerned about getting hit by a train

741
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,520
you've kind of given up a lot of that

742
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
stability um and so you're rolling the

743
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,000
dice

744
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,039
pretty good so i guess like now that you

745
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
know a teeny little bit about base

746
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,280
jumping

747
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,760
uh what would you do in this situation

748
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,520
uh i guess like show of hands for hop

749
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,679
the rail

750
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,280
a few all right how about running faster

751
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,840
than a train

752
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,480
and i'm assuming everyone who didn't

753
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
vote is just like too smart to be on a

754
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,280
rail bridge at four o'clock in the

755
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,400
morning which is

756
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
kind of reasonable um

757
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
so sorry it's i i think the the

758
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,240
video i have of the audience updates

759
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,919
about once a second so it's very

760
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,320
difficult to read the room from here

761
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,240
so um the people in question committed

762
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,360
to running uh

763
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,919
and i think all things considered that's

764
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,600
probably the right call

765
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,360
um i mean given that i'm here to tell

766
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,600
you the story is probably all right

767
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,559
um but you know it was it was an

768
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,240
extremely committed decision right like

769
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,720
once

770
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,159
once you start running that's your

771
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,159
option um you know steve

772
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,440
made it to the end of the bridge the

773
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,600
other person actually didn't um they

774
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,039
wound up having to bail onto their

775
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,440
stomach and let the train pass over them

776
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,640
um which is a pretty it's not a great

777
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,000
position to be in

778
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
um not in the middle of the tracks i

779
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,760
guess like if you imagine train tracks

780
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,960
and then there's like a gap up to the

781
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,480
side and then like the train overhangs

782
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
it it was like off in that little part

783
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,400
but

784
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,919
you know it's not a really good feeling

785
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,520
to have a train like hauling an ass

786
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,600
directly over you

787
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,400
um and then you know the train kept

788
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919
slowing down and speeding up

789
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,760
my hypothesis is that the people on the

790
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,039
train were deciding whether or not to

791
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,159
get out and kick the out of the

792
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,360
jumpers in question

793
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,840
um but you know they hopped into the car

794
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,200
um hold us out of there

795
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,520
the driver had been living in the us for

796
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,120
a fair while at this point

797
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,080
um and so his mate steve had to politely

798
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,360
ask if he would drive on the left side

799
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,240
of the road

800
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
um was there a good minute or two into

801
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,840
the drive

802
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
uh which i think was probably a good

803
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,440
choice in in context

804
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,600
um and so there you know there's a lot

805
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,840
to to tease a part about this incident

806
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
right like obviously

807
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,919
that this was like not a good example of

808
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
like appropriately assessing and

809
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,200
managing risk like any any time where

810
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
you nearly die in a brand new way you

811
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
hadn't even contemplated when you were

812
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,440
planning nearly dying

813
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,720
um it's probably not something that

814
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,480
you're going to write off as a success

815
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,039
i guess the punchline to all this is

816
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,799
that there's a catwalk

817
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,080
right if you look at this picture

818
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,240
there's a beam that runs under the

819
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,279
bridge and you can

820
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,679
walk on it right and if we'd been under

821
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
there which is where we're meant to be

822
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,760
or where where they were meant to be the

823
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,760
train passes overhead and you just don't

824
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,120
care because you're in a different place

825
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,440
right and this is where the person that

826
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,880
they got the beta from

827
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,320
you know i mean obviously it's not their

828
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,919
fault do what you

829
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,760
can you know you take the information

830
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,120
and make choices based on it

831
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,640
but had they known that you're meant to

832
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,159
be on the catwalk under the bridge and

833
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,600
not up on the tracks

834
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,360
um this would be a pretty different

835
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,120
story right

836
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,400
and so like where did this all go wrong

837
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,799
um this link this chain has like so many

838
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
problems with it right like obviously

839
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,240
not knowing about the catwalk is

840
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,159
probably like i think the most crucial

841
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,919
 up like all of the other ups

842
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:16,960
combined

843
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,600
were extremely survivable the the

844
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,440
decision to be up on top of the bridge

845
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,840
like

846
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,640
with the train um could absolutely have

847
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,480
had like really really dire consequences

848
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,120
and could have been super horrific

849
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,480
not having a concrete plan for what

850
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,400
happens like given that that they were

851
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,760
committed to being up on top of this

852
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,200
bridge

853
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,960
if they'd already discussed what they

854
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,400
were going to do if a train came around

855
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,520
the bend

856
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,880
this probably would have had a really

857
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,480
different outcome right because they

858
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,360
would have had

859
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,520
a lot more valuable time to execute the

860
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,600
plan instead of making it as they went

861
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,120
along and i think this is one of the

862
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,240
huge ones that i see

863
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
which is not only like having a plan

864
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,240
back to kind of the professional context

865
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,159
but this is essentially to talk about

866
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,600
not only having a plan for when things

867
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,760
are going really well um but deciding

868
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,600
ahead of time like after you this

869
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,240
up

870
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,600
how are you gonna dig your way out of

871
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
that decision

872
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,039
right and so i think there's like two

873
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,559
parts to this like one is like we should

874
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,919
have assessed the risks better and the

875
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,200
other is that we should have managed the

876
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,080
risks better

877
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,760
we should obviously have known a lot

878
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,440
more about the jump we should

879
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,360
probably have just decided to not do it

880
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,880
for another day or two until we could

881
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,840
have

882
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,000
you know better got the information but

883
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,960
we also should have

884
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,360
made so many different choices around

885
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,559
how we dealt with it

886
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,080
right and so i guess that's like a

887
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,679
personal anecdote that i find pretty

888
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:32,880
funny although i'm seeing a lot of

889
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,159
serious faces

890
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,120
uh about like how you can just barely

891
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,200
survive making mistakes but there's this

892
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,279
um analogy in base jumping saying you

893
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,799
have a jaw full of luck and a jar full

894
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,000
of experience right and you have to fill

895
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,440
the experience job before you run out of

896
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,200
luck one

897
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,039
this was an incident that ate a lot into

898
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,640
a luck job

899
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
so the second incident that i want to

900
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
talk about um happened in moab which is

901
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,279
honestly

902
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,880
one of the most beautiful places on

903
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,120
earth um these are some random pictures

904
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,679
that i took

905
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,960
uh last time i was in moab um mobs owned

906
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
by the blm which is the bureau of land

907
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,240
management which is a really confusing

908
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,120
acronym to overload right now um and so

909
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,480
it's land that you can basically do

910
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,919
whatever you want with their position is

911
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,840
basically like this is

912
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
terrain that's for using so like come

913
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
and toss yourself off it fly airplanes

914
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,039
drive jeeps like do whatever just try

915
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,039
not to break it while you're here um if

916
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,640
you're going to go full driving i highly

917
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,840
recommend that you take

918
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,360
an actual four-wheel drive and not have

919
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,120
rental focus but that's a story for a

920
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,960
different time

921
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,120
so i was at this jump called welshman's

922
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,000
um

923
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,480
and welshman's is pretty short it's 180

924
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,919
feet if you kind of remember

925
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,840
that like scale of object height to

926
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,840
scariness you know 150 feet was about as

927
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,039
low as you want to go without special

928
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:41,840
equipment

929
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,520
so you know i mean it's like on the low

930
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,520
side um forgive the slow motion video

931
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,480
but this is what

932
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
um i guess like jumping with a static

933
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,919
line that device i talked about before

934
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,120
that that automatically pulls your

935
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,200
parachute out of your container for you

936
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
and it looks like right so we're out at

937
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,240
welshman's um

938
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,440
we're all having a really great time

939
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,799
we're not doing any crime so we're

940
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,000
allowed to do it in broad daylight with

941
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,440
a large group of our friends

942
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,960
everyone's having a blast and my friend

943
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,240
decides that he doesn't like the

944
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,039
conditions he

945
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,039
he feels that the wind through this

946
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,799
canyon is excessive

947
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,559
particularly for a jump that's too low

948
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,320
and so he decides to not jump

949
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,399
right awesome high fives all around this

950
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,000
is you know me talking a lot about

951
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,399
making really good decisions

952
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,320
i'm super supportive of any time that

953
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,159
someone is like i don't like this

954
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,520
i don't think this feels right i'm not

955
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
gonna do it right and making that hard

956
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,159
decision

957
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,200
to not jump is incredibly challenging in

958
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,559
context right because you've

959
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,559
often been hiking for four hours to get

960
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,080
to the exit point you know the decision

961
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,720
is like

962
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,360
do i jump and i'd land at my car or do i

963
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,640
hike for four hours in the other

964
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,279
direction

965
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,559
it's really really difficult to make

966
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,799
that call sometimes

967
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
that was a good choice i think the

968
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
choice that they made next which was to

969
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,080
go to a different object

970
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,679
um nearby really really pushed things

971
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,600
um and so this is inside footage this is

972
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,039
a face jump that doesn't go great so if

973
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,240
you're super squamish and has a good

974
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,200
time to not look

975
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,000
he's fine like miraculously he's not

976
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,399
even

977
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,240
slightly hurt um but yeah fair warning

978
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,159
um so this is a gopro on top of my

979
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,600
friend's helmet um

980
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,240
he drove out i was about to point like

981
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,279
that's helpful in

982
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,080
when i'm standing in front of the

983
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
computer uh he drove from where we were

984
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,240
at welshman to this exit which is called

985
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
funky front and you can see that he's in

986
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,840
this big snaking canyon but this canyon

987
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,880
is like elevated

988
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,240
right like if you imagine the canyon

989
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,520
i'll shut up for a second so you can see

990
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,120
this because it happens pretty quick

991
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,200
so as his pilot shoot parachute opens

992
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,520
180 he's flying directly to wall

993
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,440
and somehow because he's the luckiest

994
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,880
man in the universe

995
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,600
he lands on this tiny ledge that's

996
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,080
exactly

997
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,880
the same size as he is right and so

998
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,240
having decided that

999
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,159
he wasn't comfortable with the winds at

1000
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,360
one object

1001
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,120
he then proceeded to climb a different

1002
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
object that had worse winds

1003
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,520
jumps and as we can see he got

1004
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,200
incredibly lucky not to be seriously

1005
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,399
injured or killed

1006
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,120
um happily i mean this is like such a

1007
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,640
such an incredible incident there's also

1008
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,919
outside footage of it so this was

1009
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,760
someone filming from the ground

1010
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,600
um i can't remember what he's yelling

1011
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,559
probably something funny

1012
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
um

1013
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,120
and then credit where credit soon

1014
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,640
honestly that was a ninja move i mean

1015
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,399
physics had kind of taken the wheel

1016
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,760
he was a little bit of a passenger at

1017
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,559
that point um but if he'd done

1018
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,399
pretty much anything other than exactly

1019
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,159
what he did uh we probably would have

1020
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,520
been visiting our friend in hospital

1021
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,799
instead of

1022
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,000
hanging out with him and drinking some

1023
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,799
beers like many hours later that night

1024
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,159
right but this is another kind of

1025
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,320
classic story of a

1026
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,360
like a failure to to understand

1027
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
um assassin like manage the risks right

1028
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,399
like at the point where you've made the

1029
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,640
decision that you don't like the winds

1030
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,399
going from an object that's relatively

1031
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,080
sheltered to another object that's

1032
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,919
substantially more exposed and obviously

1033
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,760
he's going to experience a lot more wins

1034
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,120
is a pretty dubious choice um and so

1035
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,960
there's these like local factors to his

1036
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,640
decision making right where he made the

1037
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,399
decision to go to something that

1038
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,480
at least in my opinion had a lower

1039
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,000
chance of going well i mean there's a

1040
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,519
reason why i jumped off the thing that i

1041
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,399
did

1042
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,000
but there's also some very macro

1043
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,840
decisions in this case the jumper in

1044
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,039
question also had

1045
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,360
very limited skills um in terms of like

1046
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,120
mountaineering and climbing and stuff

1047
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,960
and so when he was rescued by actually

1048
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,799
quite a famous base jumper

1049
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,440
um you know she climbed down handed him

1050
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,960
a climbing harness and said like sick

1051
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,399
here's the climate here's the harness

1052
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:25,519
his obinga

1053
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,960
just repelled down and he was like i

1054
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,799
don't know how to repel right and if

1055
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,799
you're going to do base jumps in a

1056
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,360
really

1057
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,600
exposed like very far from civilization

1058
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,559
location like

1059
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,120
you should have some understanding of

1060
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,919
first aid

1061
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,360
um and your of self-rescue and basically

1062
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,519
be in some position to help yourself out

1063
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,960
if it doesn't go well because sooner or

1064
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,799
later it's not going to right the lord

1065
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,480
of average is not on your side

1066
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,880
but in this case it did um this is my

1067
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,320
buddy hanging out at the bottom of this

1068
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,880
jump

1069
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,200
uh drinking a beer telling everyone how

1070
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,559
lucky he is

1071
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,960
i guess the punchline to this is that

1072
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,000
this event was actually

1073
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,559
a fundraiser for the search and rescue

1074
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,600
in moab

1075
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,360
um and so hey we're kind of happy not to

1076
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,559
have to use their services because it'd

1077
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,080
be really embarrassing if our fundraiser

1078
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,440
cost more than it made

1079
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,840
uh and b the huge party that is the

1080
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,960
fundraiser is like

1081
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,200
further down the canyon so literally

1082
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,720
everyone who wanted to get to the party

1083
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,360
had to

1084
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,279
drop by and offer some words of

1085
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,480
encouragement while he was a couple

1086
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,399
hundred feet up a wall

1087
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,000
so it went well but this is another case

1088
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,320
of going well i guess like in spite of

1089
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,120
his plans

1090
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,479
not necessarily because of them

1091
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,360
sorry i'm trying to find a very specific

1092
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,799
place that i have to click to advance my

1093
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,159
slides while also not being able to see

1094
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,039
my cursor

1095
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,440
right and so like how do i turn this

1096
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,480
around into

1097
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,399
a security allegory and not just a

1098
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,679
series of stories about

1099
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,120
um about doing rad stuff with parachutes

1100
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,120
i think it's really crucial to have the

1101
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,799
whole picture and i

1102
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,640
i mean it's super corny it's

1103
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,640
fundamentally a ted talk right to say

1104
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,080
that base jumping has changed the way i

1105
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,880
approach

1106
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,120
risk in a professional context and i

1107
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
don't think like everyone needs to

1108
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,480
go be a base jumper so they can like be

1109
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,919
good at stopping computer hacking like

1110
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,559
that's

1111
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,960
obviously absurd but i think it is worth

1112
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,559
having that perspective that

1113
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,000
at the end of the day the goal is to go

1114
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,120
out and do awesome stuff in a

1115
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,240
sustainable way

1116
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,919
and i think a ton of people do like

1117
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,919
really lose sight of this and so i think

1118
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,880
you know if having a checklist really

1119
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
actually helps you to like measure the

1120
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,240
risk there are tons of them like for

1121
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,279
flying information

1122
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,960
for a bunch of the other stuff that i do

1123
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
and i don't love them like i

1124
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,360
just talked through for 30 minutes about

1125
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,200
how it's super crucial to

1126
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,799
to have a plan and to write things down

1127
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,399
and to manage your risk and now i'm

1128
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,519
going to turn around and be like well

1129
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:36,000
don't

1130
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,679
don't write it down unless it's super

1131
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,360
helpful for you because the the

1132
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,880
frameworks that that help you like

1133
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,240
attach a number to it are always going

1134
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,440
to be super flawed

1135
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,559
and it's human nature to find

1136
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,159
to extrapolate from the data what you

1137
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,840
want to see right like you'll be able to

1138
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,600
turn that number into a go decision if

1139
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,960
that's what you really want to do right

1140
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
and that's exactly what happened to

1141
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,159
to the people involved in both of those

1142
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,559
situations there was a lot to say

1143
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,480
don't climb onto this rail bridge like

1144
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,000
this is not going to go well there was a

1145
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,120
ton to say like

1146
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,880
at the point we've decided to not jump

1147
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,799
tonight like just don't jump tonight

1148
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,079
like go to the party have a beer with

1149
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:08,960
your friends it's like

1150
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,480
it's fine you don't have to go and do a

1151
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,000
base jump

1152
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,839
um in both of these cases they they

1153
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,440
didn't make that decision

1154
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,599
so while it's super crucial to like make

1155
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,679
these go decisions it's also really

1156
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,000
crucial

1157
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,359
to like detach yourself from that

1158
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,119
decision as much as you possibly can and

1159
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,560
if you can you know write down what that

1160
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,199
criteria is before you start

1161
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,599
so i guess to finally wrap things up um

1162
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,719
you know do rad

1163
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,320
that's absolutely what i'm getting at

1164
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,800
here like um get into base jumping if

1165
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,000
that's something you really want to do

1166
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,679
like go grind out those 200 cutouts and

1167
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,280
toss yourself off a bridge

1168
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
um but if you're gonna do something

1169
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
awesome whether it's

1170
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,000
passing yourself off a bridge or

1171
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,679
releasing a scary product or

1172
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,520
you know whatever it may be in the

1173
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,119
context of your

1174
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,440
of your day job you should have a

1175
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,040
convincing explanation for why it's

1176
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,800
probably going to go fine right like it

1177
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,480
doesn't have to be bulletproof

1178
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,079
there is a reason that the risk

1179
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,680
assessment involves confidence intervals

1180
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
and averages and stuff but

1181
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,880
if you can't clearly articulate while

1182
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,400
you're fairly confident this is going to

1183
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,839
be all right

1184
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,119
oh it's probably not going to be all

1185
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,280
right um and i guess the other takeaways

1186
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,440
is like take more selfies i used to like

1187
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,800
really kind of take issue with people

1188
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,720
who like took shitloads of selfies

1189
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,599
um and now i take as many as i can um

1190
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,800
and like tell your friends you love them

1191
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,040
because life's short

1192
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,040
so i don't know what the deal is with q

1193
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,320
a i know there's a discord

1194
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,240
um i also i think i finished eight

1195
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,599
minutes early i can't remember what time

1196
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:27,839
i

1197
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,440
started i'm either eight minutes early

1198
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,960
or like 23 minutes early which seems

1199
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,440
unlikely

1200
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,040
but the good news is i talk too fast

1201
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,400
like a dumbass and now i have bonus

1202
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,800
content

1203
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,839
so what's it like the opposite end of

1204
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:44,720
the spectrum

1205
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,599
right like i talked a lot about like i

1206
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,200
guess what i would regard as being a

1207
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
premeditated bad decision right like you

1208
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,760
have

1209
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,640
lots and lots of time to to figure out

1210
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,520
whether or not

1211
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
what you're doing makes any sense um and

1212
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:58,960
then

1213
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,200
it culminates in a go no-go decision

1214
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,440
most of the like period where you're

1215
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,720
figuring out what you're doing with your

1216
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,440
life

1217
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,160
is pretty slow and pretty opt-in right

1218
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
like at any point you can bail out

1219
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,240
um some of the stuff i'm involved with

1220
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,000
is way at the other end where you you

1221
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,119
basically build yourself

1222
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,359
up to what is nearly a very bad decision

1223
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,800
and then you figure out whether or not

1224
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,160
it's gonna go really well

1225
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,960
um so i mentioned that i i compete in

1226
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,280
the

1227
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,960
the dumbest spot ever called swooping so

1228
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,880
this is me flying a parachute

1229
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,119
um past the ground and my friend at

1230
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,640
about 80 miles an hour

1231
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,800
um and the rollout on that was about

1232
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,560
i know about a foot off the ground and

1233
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,839
the nearest thing i had to the ground

1234
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,119
was my tailbone

1235
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,200
um so you can probably kind of do the

1236
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,720
math on what happens if you get that

1237
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,440
wrong

1238
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,520
and look there's the margin for error

1239
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,880
i'm not trying to imply that every time

1240
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
i do this i nearly die because i would

1241
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,760
definitely be dead by now um also this

1242
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,280
goes really really well for me every

1243
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,720
single time apart from the one time i

1244
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,760
broke my back

1245
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,240
but you know this is like way at the

1246
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,880
other end

1247
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,200
where yeah i've like done a bunch of

1248
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,720
mitigating this is what that looks like

1249
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,000
from the inside this is with the camera

1250
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,280
attached to my helmet

1251
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,280
um you know i spent a whole bunch of

1252
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,040
time like figuring out

1253
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,160
how to do this as safely as possible but

1254
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
the reality is like i mean the last half

1255
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
a second of this

1256
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,040
things are happening pretty quick and

1257
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
it's kind of down to like

1258
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,040
physics at this point like there's uh

1259
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,400
there's an old expression like the

1260
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,680
skydab's not over when you're done with

1261
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,280
it the skydives everyone physics is done

1262
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,240
with you

1263
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,359
um and kind of managing that

1264
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,920
part of the risk also i run like a clown

1265
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,880
um

1266
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,720
it is is really really challenging

1267
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,480
because this this definitely gets out

1268
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,920
into the

1269
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,119
the far reaches of the unpredictability

1270
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,880
of the situation that you find yourself

1271
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,359
in and

1272
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,160
i think this also kind of crops up a ton

1273
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,359
um

1274
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,280
you know in our lives as security people

1275
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,680
where there is a ton of like yeah i mean

1276
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,200
what what do you do with those black

1277
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,800
swan events right like

1278
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,480
in this case like turbulent air can can

1279
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,240
really have a huge problem with you but

1280
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,160
you know if you have at the farm on like

1281
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,400
open ssl is good which was like a super

1282
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,160
reasonable position to take like before

1283
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,440
2014.

1284
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,680
um you know sometimes things are just

1285
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,359
gonna happen and again it comes back to

1286
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,720
this ability to have

1287
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,880
at least contemplated what your plan is

1288
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,160
when it all goes wrong

1289
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,760
um because those valuable seconds that

1290
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,520
you spend executing your plan instead of

1291
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,640
inventing one

1292
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,200
are uh probably going to be pretty

1293
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,480
significant in the grand scheme of

1294
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,359
things right like

1295
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,480
your decisions like add up um so i have

1296
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,240
one more video of me just doing stupid

1297
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,760
 um because at this point this was

1298
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,400
literally

1299
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,079
bonus content in case i talked way too

1300
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,680
fast um

1301
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,400
and then i i think they kind of replied

1302
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,079
that maybe i can try and do live q a but

1303
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,440
there's probably someone

1304
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,760
really pale behind the sound desk now as

1305
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,040
i suggest that

1306
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,440
um so i guess like to wrap up with with

1307
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,800
the dumbest white people sport of all

1308
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,480
this is uh it's called speed flying so

1309
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,040
it's like

1310
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,800
halfway in between i guess you take your

1311
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,119
parachute you run off a cliff with it

1312
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,400
already inflated

1313
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
and then you see how close you can come

1314
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,599
to hitting the cliff as many times as

1315
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,119
you can on the way down

1316
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,960
um this used to be a hill that was about

1317
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,640
10 minutes from my office so

1318
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,160
this is how i spent all of my days after

1319
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,839
work

1320
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,920
um so awesome um i've been richard butts

1321
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,839
this has hopefully been good i will

1322
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:15,119
freely admit that it's

1323
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,359
incredibly unnerving to to just talk at

1324
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,400
a desk for

1325
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,720
for 45 minutes um in front of the camera

1326
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,560
there's no updating super often

1327
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,960
um you've been great thank you

1328
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:43,359
all right

1329
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,440
you
