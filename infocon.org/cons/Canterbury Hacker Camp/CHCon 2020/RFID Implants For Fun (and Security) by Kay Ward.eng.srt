1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,080
okay

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,759
so my talk today is on rfid implants for

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,080
fun and you can use them for general

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,160
security of buildings as well

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,920
so let's get forward there is the

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,960
content warning with this talk

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
it comes with the field there will be

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,600
some discussion of medical procedures

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,720
not a lot

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,119
just letting you know no images of

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,160
needles i'm not going to be doing that

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,760
some x-rays just x-ray over hand

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,160
so a little bit of discussion of that

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,079
kind of stuff

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,960
and no medical advice i'm not a doctor

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,559
don't take your advice from a 17 year

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,719
old

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,000
all right so more about me my name is

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,320
kay

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,440
i go by k-zone on twitter dave m

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
i'm a student i'm 17. i work at a small

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,360
startup called mcdonald's

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,719
and i'm a double rfid implantee get more

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,680
into that later

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
what this talk is is an exploration of

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,280
rfid technologies

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
and how it can be used in the real world

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,799
for

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,320
accessing your building securing

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,439
tools cargo whatever else and

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,799
exploration of implants

32
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,759
and their uses and why they even exist

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,640
what this talk is

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,000
not is medical device

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,880
not a doctor it's not a lecture on

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
electromagnetism

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,600
because i don't know enough about that

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,280
to do that

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,360
and it's not a guide on rfid access

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
control if you're

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,159
working at a site where you know you

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,520
need to install these systems you need

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,079
to migrate

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,399
them don't take my advice i'm not

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,240
qualified

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
so what actually is rfid you can see on

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,200
the left there's a diagram that shows

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
the tag and a device and it uses

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,640
magnetic fields to interact and shear

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
data and energy

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,840
i don't know how magnets work so don't

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,719
ask me it stands for radio frequency

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,399
identification

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,719
you can use electromagnetic fields and

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,759
there are two main

56
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,920
groups of technology within this there

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
are 125 kilohertz which is the

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,080
older not classical but and more common

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
standard and there's 1356 megahertz

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,080
which is what you might find on a

61
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,440
transit card or something like some

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,640
something like that what is rfid not

63
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,720
it's not a gps tracking device you

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,319
cannot track a tag

65
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,840
with any kind of precision from a

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920
distance like that the highest you've

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,239
seen

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,599
is maybe a few feet from a big briefcase

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,440
antenna

70
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,040
it's not a mind control device

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
shockingly

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
and it's not something they put in

73
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,959
vaccines i promise

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,640
so we we talk about these two things

75
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,640
called rfid and nfc

76
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,200
they're different but similar and that's

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,800
why they get a lot of confusion between

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,480
the names

79
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,879
that stands for near field communication

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,080
which is

81
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
something might have in your phone

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,879
colloquially we refer to rfid as usually

83
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
the 125 kilohertz and nfc the 1356

84
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,080
it's technically not correct but you

85
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,879
know

86
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,280
rfid is an umbrella term for various

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,959
technologies one of which is nfc

88
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,959
and nfc devices can act as a reader and

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,440
a tag so you can share data

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
so there are similar systems between two

91
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
phones where you can tap them together

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,879
and it'll share data between the two

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
and yeah your phone might support it

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,000
it's a little

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,040
out there whether it will there are a

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,319
lot of applications

97
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,000
of rfa nfc all that one of which is

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,959
access control that's the really big one

99
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,120
there's asset tracking so you might have

100
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,400
a lot of stock moving through a

101
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,120
warehouse

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,319
you might have a bunch of tools you want

103
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,400
to keep track of where they've been

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,239
and another big one is casino chips

105
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,040
they'll often embed tags inside a chip

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
to check if it's a real one or if it's

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,159
been altered in some way

108
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,480
you're also in passports if you have a

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
recent new zealand passport it probably

110
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,360
has a little logo on the bottom

111
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,799
that's an e-passport that's how

112
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,760
the fast access things work and security

113
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,280
at an airport

114
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
there's payment which is very relevant

115
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,439
in the past few months

116
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,839
so you can tap your phone tap your card

117
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
and not have to contact the

118
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,560
actual pin pad use the animal

119
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,639
identification so you might have

120
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,000
your pet or something that will have a

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,320
chip just installed and

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,040
it's back usually and that'll help

123
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,880
identify them

124
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,600
fashion is a new one there's bracelets

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
earrings

126
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
rings that you can get they have nfc

127
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,720
chips in them

128
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
human implantation is the very weird one

129
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
we're going to be talking about today a

130
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,280
little bit

131
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
just later more on access control

132
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
so that's just controlling access to a

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
building by an rfid tag

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
the big one is prox card 2 that is the

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
older one that is pretty much ubiquitous

136
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,520
everywhere

137
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,199
any any reader that supports a modern

138
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,960
technology often still supports prox

139
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,080
card

140
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,680
iclass is a more recent one which is

141
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
a little more complicated it's a high

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,800
frequency card

143
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,240
there's my fear which is the kind of

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
thing you would usually see on a transit

145
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,800
system if you've been using the

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,479
christchurch metro that's a my favorite

147
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,919
card

148
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,520
and there are also cards that just use

149
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,759
uids from the tag itself

150
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,160
to identify them so nothing special

151
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,479
going on is just the idea

152
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
frost card 2 is highly common

153
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,120
it's low frequency it has a very simple

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
data format that's usually referred to

155
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,880
as a weekend it's

156
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,880
a little bit of a mislimer but that's

157
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
the term people use

158
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
and it's easily cloned so you can do

159
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,720
drive by cloning things like that

160
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,120
they're about 16.7 million combinations

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,240
of different cards

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
you can see on the right there that's

163
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,759
the diagram so there is an

164
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,319
8-bit facility code and a 16-bit card

165
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,199
code

166
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,919
so it's 16.7 plus million possible ones

167
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,800
for those

168
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,560
iclass it is encrypted

169
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
it is only readable by specific readers

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
because they'll have to decrypt the card

171
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,319
when it's red

172
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,759
there's more storage space on the cards

173
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,880
you might be able to store contact

174
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
details and like that

175
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,000
it's more secure than prox card 2 can't

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
be drive by cloned

177
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,680
until somebody dumps the master key in

178
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,319
which case it can't

179
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,880
then my fear it's a family of

180
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,319
technologies owned by a company called

181
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,280
nxp

182
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,919
they do a lot of nfc they're all 1356

183
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,120
they're typically found in transit

184
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,440
systems as i said before

185
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
and they're used all by all of the

186
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
canterbury metro systems so tamara

187
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,840
christchurch will use a myfit card

188
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
they're primarily two ones called

189
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,199
classic and deathfire we'll get into

190
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,240
those

191
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
and these various encryption schemes

192
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,000
myfia classic

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,199
is the old one from around 1994 it was

194
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,039
first used to transport in seoul and

195
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:57,520
korea

196
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,960
in 1996 and it has a proprietary

197
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,199
encryption algorithm called crypto1 and

198
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,800
as we all know

199
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,880
they're very secure it was broken around

200
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,840
2009

201
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,000
probably a bit earlier they can be

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,680
easily cloned these days with some

203
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,360
pretty cheap tools

204
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,639
and they're originally used by timaru

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,639
metro but they've been invalidated

206
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,560
recently because of those

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,919
problems with them this fire is the more

208
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,960
secure one around 2002

209
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,599
they had revisions in 2006 2016 and

210
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,440
2020.

211
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,319
they use triple deaths on the card and

212
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,400
the original one was broken in 2010 by

213
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
some complicated side channel attacks

214
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,800
i don't really know them there are some

215
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,960
good papers you can read about that

216
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,520
and the ev2 replaced myfit classic in

217
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,879
the tomorrow metro

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,639
the christchurch metro typically uses

219
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,599
ev1s i think

220
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,680
and next one is passports so that's the

221
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
passport logo you might see on a

222
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
recent new zealand passport they're

223
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,199
called e-passports

224
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,280
they run a java card applet so yes your

225
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
passport runs java

226
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,000
and they're defined by the international

227
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,879
civic

228
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,199
civil aviation authority so they define

229
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,560
the standard how the

230
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,680
what ships you use what's stored on them

231
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,759
they have various attacks against them

232
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,400
there's been some problems where

233
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,840
their readers at airports aren't

234
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
checking any hashes

235
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
but next up is payment cards there are

236
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
small prepaid card companies that are

237
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,960
doing this

238
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,280
they're pretty small the they often have

239
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,639
large fees

240
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,039
it's a hard field to get into the big

241
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,680
ones are

242
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
visa pay wave mastercard contact lists

243
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,200
google pay and apple pay on your phone

244
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,479
but these all share

245
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,200
a sort of consortium called emv for

246
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,760
europa

247
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,839
mastercard and visa they're the ones who

248
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,080
are defining the standard

249
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
they're pretty much impossible to get a

250
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,040
foot in the door in the in the game

251
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,600
though

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
there's a few companies working on

253
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
implants for them but the problem is

254
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
dealing with mastercard visa is

255
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,959
extremely difficult

256
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,399
they often use triple gas as well

257
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,200
and animal implants that is one of the

258
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,240
x-rays

259
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,320
you can see they put it just above the

260
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,959
skin on the back usually not below it

261
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,200
they're used for vets to identify a pet

262
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,959
it stores a registration number

263
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,040
that can then be linked back to the

264
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,800
owner through a national database

265
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,320
usually

266
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,200
they use kilohertz or 134 the latter of

267
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,080
which is usually called

268
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,920
fdxb it has a custom

269
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,560
data format that is a little complicated

270
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,080
there are multiple standards for them

271
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,640
they're not

272
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,720
really ubiquitous it depends on the

273
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
region you're in

274
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
they have much in common with human

275
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
implants that we'll get into

276
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,959
fashion is an interesting one it is in

277
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,720
fact a thing

278
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,120
we have rfid wristband wristbands that

279
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,160
were used at festivals that can tell if

280
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,360
you're allowed to be there if you're

281
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,320
allowed to drink

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,200
similar to that efc rings look just go

283
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,720
around your finger you can

284
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,240
tap them share twitter or something like

285
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,640
that and you have earrings which i'm

286
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
actually wearing right now

287
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
here that is just an led when it comes

288
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,440
near

289
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,120
a rfid field it will glow

290
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,800
and the main tools we use for this kind

291
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,720
of stuff on the right is called a

292
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,200
prox mark 3 rdv4 it is a general purpose

293
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,079
rfid tool

294
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,920
you can do pretty much anything you

295
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,839
would need to do for it besides very

296
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,079
complicated attacks

297
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,360
it can sniff clone and emulate tags so

298
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,160
if you you can drive by clone someone's

299
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
work badge and then you can emulate it

300
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,720
and there's various different types of

301
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,240
proximate hardware available

302
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,760
the rdv4 is a few hundred dollars

303
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,519
you can get cheap ones from aliexpress

304
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,040
that are sort of

305
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,880
simpler but they work just as well

306
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,160
human implants big one most

307
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,560
popular technologies in the rfid space

308
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,560
have an implant available that you can

309
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,519
buy

310
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,839
they're not particularly invasive it

311
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,360
depends on your definition

312
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
usually they use a rather large needle

313
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,040
and they're injected into the hand

314
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
there's a wide variety of options

315
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
between

316
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,920
injections you can get flat flex chips

317
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,440
that have to be installed more

318
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
invasively

319
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
there are very few vendors that do this

320
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,000
the problem is finding someone that's

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,640
reputable

322
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,160
and checks their supply chain

323
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,480
typically they are a cylindrical coil

324
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,680
that is encased in

325
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,079
some bio glass by company called scotch

326
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,839
i believe so you pronounce it

327
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,680
that is only very slightly um

328
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
interactive with your skin they're

329
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
useful in the right circumstances

330
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
if you have sort of a workplace that has

331
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,160
badge readers and you're

332
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
real good friends with a security guy

333
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,279
you might be able to get one of these

334
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,880
registered and get into your workplace

335
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,240
with one

336
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,720
the they are harder to clone but that is

337
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,440
only

338
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,160
because the distance required to read

339
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,560
one

340
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,160
is a lot closer

341
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,920
implants what i have in my hands right

342
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
now

343
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,079
are one implant in each of my hands they

344
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:02,560
are

345
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,360
an xem which is 125 and xnt which is a

346
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,320
1356.

347
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,959
i did them myself in march just before

348
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,920
lockdown

349
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
do not do this do as i say not as i do

350
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,200
um the company that makes these will

351
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,279
tell you the same thing if you can get a

352
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,320
professional

353
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,360
get a professional to do it they're

354
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,279
similar on slides to a grain of rice

355
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,920
pretty big grain of rice and they're

356
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,360
injected between the first

357
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
and second metacarpals in your hand just

358
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,200
here

359
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,839
i don't have many uses for them i'm not

360
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,519
at a workplace where i have a badge

361
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,000
reader

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,360
to get into my building so

363
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,880
pretty much i just have my twitter on

364
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,720
one of these which you can ask me about

365
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,880
later if you want to

366
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,839
the options are usually from

367
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,000
dangerousthings.com

368
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,079
this is not sponsored i wish it was

369
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,279
though

370
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,120
most technologies they have an implant

371
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,720
for the

372
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,760
next t which is a combination of high

373
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,560
frequency

374
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,600
and low frequency and one chip

375
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,200
and they can emulate a lot of low

376
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,120
frequency cards

377
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,440
the xnt and the xem that i have are the

378
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,120
same thing they're split into two

379
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
different chips

380
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,880
the xdf2 is a myfair deathfire ev2 that

381
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
has 8 kilobytes of storage

382
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,800
on the chip so you can store your whole

383
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,959
cv probably in a few bit more

384
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,920
the xm1 is the myf classic there's 1k of

385
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,800
storage

386
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
it can also be modified to change the

387
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,480
uid which you're not supposed to be able

388
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:30,959
to do

389
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,000
but some companies in china do it anyway

390
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,720
there's also the spark 2 which is an

391
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
implant that can do aes 128 and vivo

392
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,279
and it can do some two-factor

393
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,920
authentication usually only through

394
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,440
vivokey's specific platform

395
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,519
coming soon though is the apex which is

396
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,480
a general

397
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,920
smart card ship sorry i thought it was

398
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,199
mate

399
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,440
it can generate 2fa codes because it

400
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,959
just runs java card outputs

401
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,079
so soon your hands can run java

402
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,120
the process of purchasing one of these

403
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
like i said there is very few reputable

404
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,760
vendors the main thing is

405
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,720
dangerousthings.com they ship globally

406
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
not sponsored they will ship to new

407
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
zealand for free over

408
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,680
150 i think sometimes you can get these

409
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,480
at conferences

410
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,399
so big conferences like defcon they'll

411
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,399
often have a table with some guy who's

412
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,760
like if you buy this

413
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,800
i'll put it in for you it's a little bit

414
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,240
sketchy but you know

415
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,560
animal chips are usually very cheap

416
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
they're encased in an adhesive

417
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,120
sort of a bio bond do not use these they

418
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,600
will

419
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,839
stick to your skin almost permanently

420
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,040
and it's incredibly difficult to get

421
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,320
them out

422
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,600
i don't know that from first-hand

423
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,519
experience but i know people who do

424
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,000
do not buy these from aliexpress they

425
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
might seem obvious but

426
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,000
it is what it is um you can see on the

427
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,040
right there there's an

428
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,279
a strange contaminant leaking out of an

429
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,880
aliexpress chip

430
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,399
i don't think anybody knows what that is

431
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,160
but it's not good

432
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,760
they're also completely potted on the

433
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,160
inside most good quality chips are only

434
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,120
slightly

435
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,320
adhered to the glass installing one of

436
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
these is pretty complicated in new

437
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
zealand

438
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,120
most implants have a three millimeter

439
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,279
diameter needle that sounds pretty big

440
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,480
it's pretty big they're cheevily

441
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,760
injected between first and second

442
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
metacarpals like i said

443
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,360
they're not particularly painful

444
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,000
probably it's very dependent on who you

445
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,320
are

446
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
personally mine were easier learn ear

447
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,279
piercings in my experience

448
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,600
it could be completely different for you

449
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,240
they should be done by a professional

450
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,839
you can often get piercers to do these

451
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,440
for you and

452
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,720
you have to be very good friends with

453
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
them dangerous things has a list of

454
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
professional installers on their site

455
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,959
like i said passing shops might agree to

456
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,639
do it you have to ask them

457
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,440
it's a bit touching whether they will

458
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,920
and

459
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,199
the uses of these implants anything a

460
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,199
regular rfid tag can do

461
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,079
you can use one of these for it you can

462
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,839
unlock rfid enabled doors at your

463
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,240
workplace wherever else you might be

464
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
unlocking computers with a dedicated

465
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,519
reader you can see on the right

466
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,639
that is basically it'll read the uid

467
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,240
from the chip and it'll spit it out as

468
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,160
keyboard input

469
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,759
you can also send your contact details

470
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,600
but you see like i said i have twitter

471
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
on mine so you can just scan it

472
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,399
and it'll bring up my twitter on your

473
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,160
phone you'll also do 2fa with some chips

474
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,519
it's mostly a novelty it's pretty

475
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,040
interesting to do 2fa on your hand

476
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,800
though

477
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,399
and physical pen testing jobs they have

478
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,560
a really interesting application in that

479
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,399
devian olaf if you know her that is a

480
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,240
big american hacker

481
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,079
he had a story where he was on a job

482
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,079
where he cloned a guards

483
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,920
badge that would have given access to

484
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,440
the entire building

485
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,199
so what he did is he kept his guest

486
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,360
badge on him and when he walked up to a

487
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:45,920
reader

488
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,600
he had his guest badge in his fingers

489
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
and he went like that to tap it to it

490
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,399
and on all the cameras it looked like he

491
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,839
was using his guest badge to get into

492
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,040
the server room

493
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,600
he was not so just to close up

494
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,759
rfid is a ubiquitous incredibly useful

495
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,559
technology it's used everywhere

496
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
there's various levels of security for

497
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,919
different applications

498
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,240
there's i didn't mention it before but

499
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,079
there's ultra high frequency

500
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,760
chips as well those will be used in

501
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,079
warehouses that is one of the big ones

502
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,760
where security isn't really a huge

503
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,439
concern for that because you're tracking

504
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,480
stock moving around implants are an

505
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,599
interesting way to get into your

506
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,640
