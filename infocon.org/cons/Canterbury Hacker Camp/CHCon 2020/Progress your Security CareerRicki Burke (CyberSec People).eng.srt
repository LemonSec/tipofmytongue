00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,119
plug for the podcast but

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,400
you're welcome to listen to it if you

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,880
get a chance at some point um

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
and then done a bunch of other stuff um

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,159
that hopefully

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,439
gives me a bit of credibility to

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,639
actually talk about the industry

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,079
so today i'm talking about the podcast

42
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,680
that i host and again i'm not trying to

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
sell it to you but we're gonna cover

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,439
some stories um so

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,040
in this podcast i've spoke to some

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,600
incredible people including tony

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,840
um but i've spoken to people like steve

48
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
katz the world's first ever ciso

49
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,439
red teamers purple teamers researchers

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,240
people

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
that have run businesses and and all

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,439
sorts of really amazing stories and

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,640
i think what's really helpful is

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
learning from others and the ability to

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,640
hear those stories maybe get some advice

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,360
and

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,199
there's four particular people who i'm

58
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,200
going to highlight um who we will be

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,560
covering today

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,840
so mark bowen marks the c so for after

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,560
pay

62
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,840
if you don't know after pay they're a

63
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,480
pretty fast growing australian

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,400
fintech type company um casey ellis who

65
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
a lot of people may know through uh bug

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,239
crowd um louis from

67
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,120
pentester lab and a lady over in the u.s

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
called chloe mustaghi

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,560
and she's comes from again a very

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
different type of background

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
all different stories there's a few more

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,400
tips in there as well

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
but these four in particular i want to

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
highlight because i think again

75
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,760
valuable things that other people can

76
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,040
learn from their journeys

77
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,640
and their advice so the first is

78
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
pentester to see so and this story

79
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,160
really interests me because

80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,920
my experience is predominantly australia

81
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
and in australia

82
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
most csos do not come from a technical

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,720
background

84
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,280
let alone pen testers then he may be

85
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,200
literally one of

86
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,640
two three max people that come that sort

87
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,920
of background in australia

88
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,680
operating at that level these days and

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,760
through my role i get to speak to lots

90
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,040
of amazing people that do have

91
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,959
aspirations to grow in their careers

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,280
and some people do want to go on and do

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,760
more and some would like to become a cso

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,640
one day

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,159
and we traditionally see a lot of

96
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,440
ceasefires come from more of a sort of

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,760
risk and grc type background

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,280
and i think it's helpful to learn from

99
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,519
people like mark and how he's done it

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,840
and other people as well

101
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,879
so how did mark become a suso um so

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,879
early in his career started as a pen

103
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,000
tester

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,319
eventually got some experience doing a

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,680
bit of instant handling

106
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,400
incident response um then he went on to

107
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,280
manage

108
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
both defensive and defensive teams so he

109
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,799
got some really good exposure to both

110
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:55,840
sides

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
um he worked internationally and then

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,959
basically got exposure to both the

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,319
consultancy side

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,040
and then internal as well so through

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,560
those sort of changes through those

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
moves he got to see a lot of things and

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
understand things from different

118
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
perspectives

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,040
um so his main learns along the way

120
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,720
is again sometimes you can get a bit

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,238
lucky depending on where you land in

122
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,320
terms of company and environments but

123
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,880
the things that really helped him is in

124
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,199
his first role his first roles

125
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
he really worked with some talented

126
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,960
people and

127
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,040
in your first job or your job you may be

128
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
the only security person maybe it's a

129
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,680
really small team

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
but a really helpful thing that he

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,960
recommends is trying to surround

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,520
yourself

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,919
with talented people and the more you

134
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,520
can do that the more you can learn from

135
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,320
them and

136
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,759
whether they're mentors whether they're

137
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,040
friends whether they're just people you

138
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,080
collaborate with

139
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
it can only help your career um early on

140
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,919
he was

141
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,320
able to earn or learn i should say from

142
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,400
his perspective sort of the security

143
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,240
principles of the industry so it's not

144
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,560
just

145
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,919
technical things but really

146
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,160
understanding problems

147
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
understanding risk and how we can use

148
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,240
technology to actually solve that

149
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
and taking opportunities was really

150
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
important to him too and

151
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
so really early in his career he went

152
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,479
from

153
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,479
australia working globally over in the

154
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,520
uk and working on some really big scale

155
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
problems and this gave him really good

156
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
exposure for his future career

157
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,479
so a little bit hard to do these days in

158
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,160
terms of international travel and stuff

159
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,120
but just

160
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
taking opportunities as they come so

161
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,880
whether it's internal external

162
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,039
um being open to opportunities i think

163
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,639
is really important

164
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,800
so again in my sort of role i speak to a

165
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,759
lot of people

166
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,160
and i do find most people are actually

167
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
open-minded but there's some people that

168
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,120
maybe very closed and again everyone's

169
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,880
got different situations but

170
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
maybe not so open-minded and i think

171
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,800
this is not me trying to sell anything

172
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
but just

173
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,479
i think being open-minded just lets you

174
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,919
know what else is out there because you

175
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,880
never know

176
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
whether it's a better opportunity better

177
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,400
company whether it's just knowing that

178
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,240
where you are is actually the best place

179
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,759
for you to be right now

180
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,919
um just being aware of what's out there

181
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,479
is a really helpful thing

182
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,039
also the balance of consultancy and

183
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,800
internal so getting exposure to both

184
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,680
sides

185
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,080
so the benefit of consultancy especially

186
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
early in the career was

187
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,520
broad exposure to lots of different

188
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
things so

189
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
different problems short-term deadlines

190
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
and all sorts of things

191
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,520
but then flipping that and working

192
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
internally gave a really different view

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,639
on

194
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,319
the industry even though you're working

195
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,840
in the same sort of roles but

196
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,720
understanding how things operate how it

197
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,280
takes

198
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,199
in terms of sort of influence of working

199
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,800
and collaborating internally and

200
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
actually how to get things done in a

201
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,039
sort of bigger picture point of view

202
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,880
and then if you want to be a suici

203
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,639
understand do you actually want to be

204
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,280
one

205
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,479
so a lot of people say they want to do

206
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,919
something but they don't always know

207
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,000
what it looks like and he actually joked

208
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
and laughed sort of said it two or three

209
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,280
times about are you really sure you want

210
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,639
to do this

211
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,039
and it's because again it's the unknowns

212
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:01,680
so some

213
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,280
simple advice there is sort of reaching

214
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,720
out to people

215
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,599
so you could literally whatever role you

216
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,280
want to work in whether it's a cso

217
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,919
whether it's something else it's

218
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
find people linkedin find people at the

219
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,680
conference or whatever

220
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
that sort of title or job function you

221
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
want to be in and you can get

222
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,960
some background on what it actually

223
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,639
looks like in that job on a day-to-day

224
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,240
week-to-week basis

225
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
because on the outside something might

226
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,639
seem amazing or that's what you aspire

227
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,680
to be

228
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
on the inside it could be pretty it

229
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,520
could be the sort of stress that you

230
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,639
don't want to deal with

231
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,479
um so just being aware of those things

232
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,359
can be really helpful

233
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
um and four key things he mentioned

234
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,280
about sort of

235
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,039
i do actually enjoy these things is one

236
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,960
around mentoring so mentoring junior

237
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,680
people

238
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,039
being really important for him and his

239
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,639
career and how he's sort of helped grow

240
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,440
people and

241
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,840
what he does today um thinking about

242
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,759
problems on a multi-year scale

243
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,039
so when we're in sort of more

244
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
individual contributor type roles so

245
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,479
whether you're a pen tester or incident

246
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,599
responder or

247
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,680
a grc consultant or whatever it is

248
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,120
you're sort of

249
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,440
tracking and looking at the sort of the

250
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,800
immediate problem

251
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
you're not thinking about multi-year

252
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,440
strategies and situations and trying to

253
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
look at the big picture is i guess

254
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
what people the more senior go are

255
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
looking at so

256
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
that ability to sort of think of big

257
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,960
problems on a multi-year

258
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,759
way is how you'd be operating in that

259
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,280
sort of position so

260
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,960
the more you can do it in your role and

261
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,719
and how things can impact and have

262
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,839
knock-on effects

263
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,880
is a really good way to think influence

264
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,000
is massive so

265
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
being able to influence an organization

266
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,360
so again

267
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
starting you know early in your career

268
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
and this sort of moving upwards

269
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
the more influence you can have the

270
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,200
better and how you do that is why

271
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
i guess whether it's tricking people

272
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,200
into doing the right thing is the way he

273
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
says it or again sort of

274
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,399
just helping people understand things

275
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,920
from their perspective

276
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,600
but influence is massive so whether

277
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
you're influencing a developer to make

278
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,680
some small change based on sort of code

279
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,760
review that you're doing or whether it's

280
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
influencing strategy and the more you

281
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,120
can do that communicate

282
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
and help change things the more

283
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,240
effective you can be

284
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,720
and then exposure to the non-security

285
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,839
side of security

286
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,440
so meaning that yes security as a

287
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,519
abstract person or as an incident

288
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,279
responder or as a threat intel person

289
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,720
you would talk really differently than

290
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,839
you would to

291
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,080
someone who's not in it or someone who's

292
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,959
sort of innocent

293
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,680
in a different function so just trying

294
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:33,940
to

295
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,440
[Music]

296
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,680
basically put yourself in their position

297
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
how can you help these other people in

298
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,959
an organization

299
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,480
understand what you're doing and

300
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
basically how can you help them

301
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,480
and maybe again influence that change

302
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,959
and then these are specific things that

303
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,080
again he said

304
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
he recommends so what was really helpful

305
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,080
consultancy experience

306
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
getting sort of broad understanding

307
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,920
internal experience

308
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,959
um getting to see how grueling actually

309
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:03,760
is to sort of

310
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,000
make these changes in an organization so

311
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,959
it's one thing

312
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,480
recommending something as a sort of

313
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
external party it's another thing

314
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,440
actually

315
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,120
getting the organizations actually make

316
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,800
these changes

317
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
and then what was helpful was starting

318
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,399
in pen testing going over to the blue

319
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,440
team side

320
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,120
and then building out his awareness and

321
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,519
building out his experience

322
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,320
and then as a manager you need a network

323
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,120
of people

324
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,519
so whether that is actually hiring

325
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:30,720
people

326
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
but also talking to other people in your

327
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,839
space

328
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,640
bouncing off ideas and taking some

329
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
learns of sort of how other people have

330
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,040
done

331
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,399
certain things or gone through certain

332
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,880
situations learning from them so

333
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,880
the bigger your network and again we're

334
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,000
at a conference today

335
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
uh or at least you guys are in person um

336
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,959
the more you can do that and it's only

337
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,800
gonna help help your career

338
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,959
um and then finding opportunities in

339
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,839
your current role

340
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,680
so you don't always have to sort of move

341
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,079
up um or even move away from a business

342
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,720
to get the experience you're looking for

343
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
and to be honest you can take this

344
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,120
advice here

345
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
um particularly sort of sort of the

346
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,200
leadership roles but also for other

347
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
roles as well um but these particular

348
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,640
things around

349
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,079
again if you want to be a ciso is

350
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,920
understanding the budgeting process

351
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,600
understanding financials

352
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,839
um understanding how to communicate to a

353
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,040
board and

354
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
basically when the hits the fan and

355
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
there is an incident

356
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,279
is how to handle those things so trying

357
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,959
to get experience in those sort of

358
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,240
ways but taking that advice again and

359
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,160
putting a different perspective on it is

360
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,560
if you're someone who wants to let's say

361
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,640
get into security from another part of

362
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,240
it or even

363
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,399
something else in business you know

364
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
again you might be a developer and you

365
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,200
want to work in security

366
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,959
is there's an amazing amount of skills

367
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,480
that you can bring

368
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,720
to the industry but there's also things

369
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
you can do in your role to

370
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
add security into it as well um so you

371
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,000
don't always have

372
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
to get experience in security in

373
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,440
security

374
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
you can get it in your role and i think

375
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
a lot of people sort of

376
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
don't always think about those things

377
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
and the more you can bring it into your

378
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,120
position and not

379
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
particularly remember brendan's brendan

380
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,560
syrup so

381
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
sparkleops used to bring security um

382
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,000
into his role as a qa and as far as he

383
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,880
was concerned

384
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,680
security should be part of qa anyway and

385
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,360
people notice those things and then you

386
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,959
get opportunities

387
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,160
um next thing is entrepreneurship um so

388
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
again spoke to some really cool people

389
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
like casey and i really like his sort of

390
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
definition of a founder

391
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,320
is yeah basically you need some

392
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,800
challenges to solve and

393
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
i guess these are the key things i've

394
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,760
picked up from him and from others along

395
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
the way if you want to start a business

396
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
one of the most important things is why

397
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,200
why are you doing this thing in the

398
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,920
first place

399
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,560
is what is your mission so what problems

400
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,399
are you trying to change or what

401
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,800
problems are you trying to solve be

402
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,519
aware that

403
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
it's gonna be bloody tough um especially

404
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,279
if you're doing certain things like

405
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,519
category creation so that was one of the

406
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,200
things that casey had on his

407
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,480
plate is bug bounties weren't really a

408
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,240
thing when they started bug crowd

409
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,519
um so trying to communicate something to

410
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,880
an industry

411
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
to the people actually in security to

412
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,800
the

413
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
basically potential customers and then

414
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,240
the sort of broader community

415
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,120
there's been a pathway of doing that and

416
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,639
that's not easy

417
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
and sometimes these things timing is

418
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,480
very important

419
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,200
because you might have the right problem

420
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
you're working on but maybe you're too

421
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,760
early

422
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,000
or the other way is you're too late and

423
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
you're playing catch-up and again

424
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,199
if you're starting a business that

425
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,560
mission of why you're doing it is

426
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
massive

427
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,040
and also some things can take time um so

428
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,800
really really good example i think is

429
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,160
um louis newfiger with pentester lab

430
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
so pentester lab if you're particularly

431
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,519
in the sort of hacking

432
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,639
um community and and basically you

433
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,079
probably know pentester lab

434
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,360
um and but it's not been a sort of

435
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,040
overnight success for him so

436
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
he started this business quite a while

437
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,199
ago and it was seven years before he

438
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:07,760
actually

439
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,639
quit his job full time to go and run

440
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,399
pentester lab full time

441
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,079
and even the first time he tried a paid

442
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,399
version of it it was not successful

443
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,639
but he took his learnings from that and

444
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,560
then over time was able to refine the

445
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,320
things and put out a version of

446
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,240
the organization that basically it is

447
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,839
now um

448
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,160
but again it's taken time it took a lot

449
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,360
of

450
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
effort over a long period of time um i

451
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,959
remember speaking with him after a

452
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,600
conference

453
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
a couple years back and he was telling

454
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
me sort of it was literally

455
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,079
evenings weekends

456
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,240
every week and that's a lot of hours

457
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,760
when you're working full time and you've

458
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,160
got a family as well so there's a lot of

459
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
things to have on your plate so when

460
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,079
starting a business

461
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,160
really you again it goes back to that

462
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,920
why you know what is the mission

463
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,639
and you need to be massively passionate

464
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,079
about what you're doing because if

465
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,279
if it's more about money and of course

466
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,800
money is important because we've got to

467
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,639
pay bills and stuff but

468
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,160
if that's the driver then it's not going

469
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,600
to see you through those evenings and

470
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,279
those weekends and those tough times

471
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,120
because there will be tough times

472
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,519
um but if you're genuinely interested

473
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,959
and passionate about what you do that's

474
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,399
going to think that that will drive you

475
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,079
through those tougher times

476
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,320
and again if you've running a business

477
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,079
and you're putting all the hours in and

478
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,160
like him where again as far as he was

479
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
concerned he found the first time and

480
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,800
then he sort of

481
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
made some changes and then was

482
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,920
successful but

483
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,279
if he wasn't passionate about it he

484
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,320
couldn't have put the hours in he

485
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,519
couldn't have kept going

486
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,560
um through again sort of ups and downs

487
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,639
and what was quite interesting is

488
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,720
another learn from him is he thinks that

489
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,399
he waited too long

490
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
and it's a nice problem to have because

491
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,079
he was working at fitbit

492
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,880
as a remote security engineer for them

493
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
so

494
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,440
i don't know the specifics but i'd

495
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,120
imagine if you're working remote

496
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,360
from the us for a u.s tech company then

497
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,920
you're probably well compensated

498
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,839
so there's that to balance in terms of

499
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,199
taking that risk of quitting your

500
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,720
full-time job to go and

501
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,160
do something that you are passionate

502
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,880
about um but that's the other

503
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,720
thing to balance as well is how long do

504
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,079
you give something in terms of

505
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,680
the up and running and then once you are

506
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,199
successful when do you

507
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,320
make the big jump um so just again

508
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,240
things to be aware of

509
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
and then the last um person and

510
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,000
definitely not

511
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
um meaning the least person um but i

512
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,240
think it's a great story here is is

513
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,399
um around chloe so creating

514
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,519
opportunities so

515
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,720
chloe mustaghi really amazing

516
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,360
person who i sort of bumped into on a

517
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,920
bug crowd event earlier this year and

518
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,160
she's literally taken over my social

519
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
media feeds on linkedin and everywhere

520
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,279
else

521
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,839
very very busy lady and what's crazy is

522
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,519
she wasn't even in security

523
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,440
three years ago um so currently today

524
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,800
if you look at her profile very

525
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
impressive she's vice president of

526
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
strategy for point three security

527
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,000
um a u.s um security consultancy

528
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,359
um her basically function is

529
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,520
marketing um but a hell of a lot more

530
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,439
than that that's her background

531
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,280
um so she's a massive uh sort of

532
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,439
she calls herself an infosec advocate

533
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,640
and activist

534
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
um she's spoken over 50 events this year

535
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,199
um defcon b-sides and loads of other

536
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,400
things and it's crazy when you look at

537
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,720
her

538
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,119
um personal website how much stuff she's

539
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,640
got going on

540
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
and what's really interesting is two

541
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,000
things here

542
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
is one we have an issue which

543
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
i wouldn't say is is totally addressed

544
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,120
yet but i think hopefully is improving

545
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
and that's around sort of the diversity

546
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
and

547
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
effectively just that the whole issue of

548
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,760
being you know an industry that's

549
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,960
traditionally been sort of

550
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,320
older white dudes and

551
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,919
there is some improvements happening but

552
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,160
she nearly walked away from the industry

553
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,200
so if we go her profile today of you

554
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,600
know

555
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,919
very active in the industry sharing lots

556
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,200
of amazing content

557
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
helping so many people we as an industry

558
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
nearly lost her a couple of years ago

559
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,200
so she was a conference i think it was

560
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,559
rsa

561
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,799
but don't hold me to that but basically

562
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,039
over in the u.s and she was really

563
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,400
put off by the event um some other

564
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,679
things happened so i'm not sure if it

565
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,360
was that or maybe a different conference

566
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,240
basically

567
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
it's a real negative stuff from real

568
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,760
sort of sleaze bag things happening

569
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,679
uh which unfortunately we do hear about

570
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,600
from time to time

571
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,919
and on the back of these things she felt

572
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,280
so uncomfortable that she wanted to walk

573
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,480
away from the industry and actually

574
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
started applying for other jobs

575
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,200
fortunately for her and the industry she

576
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,039
went to

577
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,559
another conference that was a lot more

578
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,640
inclusive and then she sort of built

579
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,919
relationships and felt a lot more

580
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,200
comfortable

581
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,880
and then has gone on to do some really

582
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
cool stuff since then

583
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,440
um and i think again from two three

584
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,080
years ago

585
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,200
the industry's improving um but

586
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,600
still again a lot more work to do but

587
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,960
just goes to show and i'm sure she's not

588
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,919
the only one that

589
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,919
potentially has nearly walked away or

590
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,280
has walked away from the industry

591
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
because of just

592
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
you know negative stuff and lack of lack

593
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,720
of different things or just bad

594
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,080
attitudes and i think

595
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,760
hopefully again it's just i think it's

596
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
good to be aware of these things and

597
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,280
hopefully we can work on addressing

598
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
those

599
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,919
um what i like about chloe's background

600
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,400
is you know she's very influential she's

601
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,840
again speaking at all these amazing

602
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,400
conferences like defcon and other places

603
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,600
and she doesn't even come from a

604
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,080
technical background um so she only got

605
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,360
into security

606
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,799
through a recruiter of all people and

607
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,120
so she was working in marketing for a

608
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,480
tech company

609
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,080
she was approached by recruited say hey

610
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
do you want to apply for this role um at

611
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,760
a security company doing some marketing

612
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,720
you said yeah sure

613
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
why not and she's not one of those

614
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,480
people that

615
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,320
to be honest with you sometimes i say

616
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,840
you know you need to be passionate about

617
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,240
getting security to get into security

618
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,120
sometimes

619
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,559
it's you know you're the right place the

620
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,720
right time or the right company but

621
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,360
she had this i guess set of skills she

622
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,960
had this attitude that just really

623
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,559
worked well with what she was doing and

624
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,200
then

625
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
obviously has gone on to do good things

626
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,559
since then but

627
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,559
what's good is you know she's got again

628
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,240
appreciation of um that's

629
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,840
the technical side of things but she's

630
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,360
not a pen tester she's not an instant

631
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
responder she's not an apsec

632
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,480
um engineer she's still using her

633
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,840
marketing skills

634
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,440
and i think this is really important for

635
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,960
other people that want to get into

636
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,720
security is

637
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,159
sometimes we're coming from these other

638
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,240
backgrounds that can be really really

639
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,159
beneficial for security and they don't

640
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,000
always have to be technical

641
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
so the ability to communicate the

642
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,840
ability ability to

643
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,760
share a message you know particularly

644
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,440
let's say around security awareness and

645
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,400
things like that

646
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,080
that's massive you don't have to be

647
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,480
super technical to do those things or

648
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,320
again working in strategies around

649
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,000
understanding the organization and how

650
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,600
it can impact the industry and looking

651
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
for opportunities

652
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,240
as the business can grow so i think

653
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,440
again sometimes there's a lot of

654
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,000
pressure or sort of assumptions that you

655
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,840
have to be super technical

656
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,240
when i speak with most people that want

657
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,600
to break into security

658
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,320
it genuinely feels like 90 plus percent

659
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,640
of people want to be a pen tester

660
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,559
and the thing is there are not enough

661
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,320
jobs out there for pen testers or

662
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,120
um you know what i mean is there's so

663
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,880
many more other jobs yes pen testing is

664
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,240
one function of the industry but there's

665
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,760
so many more opportunities and if

666
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,480
anything

667
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
there are more opportunities in other

668
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,159
areas like defensive type roles

669
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,640
then offensive security and i think

670
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,840
people just need to be aware that

671
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,240
there's

672
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
there's some great things you can do but

673
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,080
especially if you utilize the

674
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,440
knowledge and the skills you already

675
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,760
have and trying to get into something

676
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,520
super technical when maybe you're not

677
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
super technical

678
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,320
is a massive leap and i think if you

679
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,720
take stepping stones of

680
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
having that foundation that you have and

681
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,960
using the skills and sort of playing to

682
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,760
your strengths

683
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,200
that can really work well for you as

684
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,559
well and maybe you can create new

685
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,559
opportunities like chloe has

686
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,400
that maybe didn't exist some time ago

687
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,760
and then one other thing that i think is

688
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,039
pretty helpful and

689
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,799
hopefully that comes through not sure if

690
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,039
it has basically

691
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,240
someone someone had again crushed by a

692
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,200
truck but they didn't is luck

693
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,080
luck plays a really big part and when i

694
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,120
spoke to

695
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,039
literally most of these people within

696
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,880
the podcast with a lot of people say

697
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
luck

698
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,760
but i think you put yourself in a

699
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
position to be lucky

700
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,679
so being at a conference today you have

701
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,280
the opportunity to go and speak to other

702
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,559
people in the community build

703
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,600
relationships

704
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,679
you never know where these things go you

705
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,640
might meet

706
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,240
your future employer you might meet your

707
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,200
future spouse or whatever you never know

708
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,640
um but also creating and taking

709
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
opportunities is in

710
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
if you have the opportunity to go on and

711
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
ex get exposure to

712
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,919
different environments different

713
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,240
countries or different businesses

714
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
broadening out your skill sets um

715
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,880
sideways moves was an interesting one

716
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
so that was recommended by craig

717
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,159
tembleton the

718
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
c so far rea group and

719
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,200
particularly in that sort of trajectory

720
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,640
that he was looking for and

721
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,679
going into that leadership role his view

722
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,120
was broadening his

723
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,960
awareness of an organization how

724
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,640
businesses operate is actually really

725
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,159
helpful and not just sort of

726
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,400
keeping keeping to a technical or

727
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,880
security silo

728
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,120
and then just putting yourself out there

729
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,960
so talking at conferences talking at

730
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,320
meetups

731
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,039
i know loads of people that have got

732
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,679
jobs

733
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,720
because they spoke at a meet up and

734
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,200
like these things can be intimidating um

735
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
talking at a conference talking at a

736
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,360
meet-up

737
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
it does not come natural for the various

738
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,120
majority of people

739
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,279
and it's one of those things that only

740
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,039
through time and practice that you can

741
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,960
get better

742
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
but again you never know what comes from

743
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,720
these things and the worst case scenario

744
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,080
is you could put yourself forward

745
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,720
um when you're doing a cfp and you might

746
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,039
get rejected you may get advice on

747
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,880
to say hey like have you thought about

748
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,559
this and maybe you can do this

749
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,200
or you might get accepted because you

750
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,880
have something really interesting to

751
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,159
share and people would love to hear

752
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,279
about that

753
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,360
so as awkward as these things are the

754
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,640
more you can try and put yourself

755
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,080
out there um the more basically you have

756
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
the opportunities to be lucky as well

757
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,440
and i think oh yes sorry one other thing

758
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,520
um it's a really interesting chat with

759
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,679
mubics um so rob fuller

760
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,600
he presented i think kiwi con a couple

761
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,039
years back

762
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,720
and i was talking with him i was asking

763
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,799
him around um

764
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,120
what was the what skills have basically

765
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
impacted your career the most

766
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,279
and i was expecting something technical

767
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,600
to be honest and he said empathy

768
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,039
which i found really really interesting

769
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,720
because this this

770
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
topic comes up a lot and particularly

771
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,960
with the hiring managers and the csos

772
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,279
that i'm dealing with is empathy

773
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,679
and okay some people might have it

774
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,440
naturally maybe it's a learnt skill but

775
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,120
it's definitely something to be aware of

776
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,760
and

777
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,320
i think the ability to put yourself in a

778
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,120
position

779
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,720
of the other person you're trying to

780
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,039
deal with and how you can benefit them

781
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,919
is massive and that can then knock on to

782
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,840
the thing of influencing because if you

783
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,520
can show empathy and you're trying to

784
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,279
make a difference to someone

785
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,760
um then hopefully you might think about

786
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,279
a different way of doing something and

787
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,480
it goes back to

788
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
like if we say a pen tester that's doing

789
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,159
a report um

790
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,200
you know after an engagement and a lot

791
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,320
of a lot of

792
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,760
roles that we have these days

793
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,080
consultancies want

794
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
pen testers that can communicate that

795
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,919
can write a good report that someone

796
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,919
non-technical is going to understand

797
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,600
and then if you go another step further

798
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,120
of sort of thinking about those people

799
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,640
are going to make those changes

800
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
how can you really help them and they

801
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,960
can go for any part of the industry so

802
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
empathy it's a great great thing to be

803
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,720
aware of and a really great thing to

804
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,960
work on

805
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,320
and that's me so thank you so much

806
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,080
for have for having me listening and i

807
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,240
really hope a thing or two maybe

808
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,840
has been picked up along the way and if

809
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,279
you have any questions please feel free

810
