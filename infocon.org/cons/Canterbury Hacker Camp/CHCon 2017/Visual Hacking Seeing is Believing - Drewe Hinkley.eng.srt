1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,240
good morning hi I'm drew so good about

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,809
me the quick rundown is complete I've

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,110
done a heck of a lot over the time so

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,369
previously I've been involved in

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,140
auditing an international hotel chain

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,339
specifically PCI DSS and information

7
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:28,380
protection and privacy assessments I've

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,080
now had a bit of a change around so I'm

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,330
more playing in the infrastructure

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,420
technology project management space but

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,090
I'm more I'm not a techie I more

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,710
specialized and work in the policies and

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,160
practices and procedural segmentation I

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,770
try to deal with the management the

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,080
c-suite etcetera so basically I handle

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,090
the boring stuff that allows the

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,920
technical guys to get on to the fun

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
stuff so I allow the developers to get

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
on with developing and the networking

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,010
guys to get on with reading Dilbert

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,159
cartoons so today we're going to have a

22
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,430
brief rundown on visual hacking so we're

23
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,080
going to go through and define actually

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,110
what is virtual hacking bit of a refresh

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,200
on what information actually is we've

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,370
spoken a lot of bad information

27
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,290
yesterday and today but let's have a

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,150
quick refresh on what that actually is

29
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,880
2017 just have vulnerable hourly - this

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,980
is quite an old mythology we'll go

31
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,330
through how it actually works the

32
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,300
mindset of any attacker and we'll look

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,790
into some mitigation strategies a lot of

34
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,010
which you will find being common-sense

35
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,780
and there might be somebody that has an

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,729
edge that may be new information to you

37
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:52,320
as well ok so visual hacking what

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,370
actually is it put very basically it's

39
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,979
the act of gathering information or

40
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,299
credentials by visual means and

41
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,460
essentially it is the world's oldest

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,560
form of hacking ever since there were

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,598
three people and two wanted to hide

44
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,659
something they could write it down the

45
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,099
third person has been wanting to find

46
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,370
out what that information is but as

47
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,590
we'll go through this is much more than

48
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,580
just

49
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,960
surfing everyone knows about shoulder

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,370
surfing this is much more involved in

51
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,890
that visual hacking is a key component

52
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,450
of internal vulnerability assistant spy

53
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,960
agency field where corporate espionage

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,410
any scenario where there is a desire to

55
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,380
gather information without the risk of a

56
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,650
digital footprint so we're not leaving

57
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,210
any breadcrumbs and networking

58
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,300
infrastructure and firewalls etc because

59
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,990
we're not touching them visual hacking

60
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,630
can be used on its own or as part of a

61
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,630
wider more targeted structured hacking

62
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:04,320
campaign so this like I say least ever

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,760
cooked refresh on the word information

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,680
what are the types of information there

65
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,770
are you know there's a lot of different

66
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,500
styles out there and for us from a

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,570
business perspective from a none phasic

68
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,850
perspective we need to be aware of the

69
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,250
potential ramifications to of business

70
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,360
if certain information is stolen hat

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,510
made public provided to a direct

72
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,800
competitor etc so we need to have that

73
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,010
understanding of what information

74
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,380
actually is and what our information

75
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,910
that we deal with in our businesses

76
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,540
actually is so quick rundown we've got

77
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,480
general information this is information

78
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,340
that if it made its way into the public

79
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,130
domain we don't really care it's

80
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,019
probably actually already out there this

81
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:57,090
is the information that may be on your

82
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,660
corporate website it may be previously

83
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,410
reported in the media do we really care

84
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,570
but whether someone has intruded our

85
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,209
systems get this information well we're

86
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,560
concerned that they've gotten to our

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,230
networks or our facilities do but we

88
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,000
don't care that the information has been

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,209
released because it's already in the

90
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,570
public domain

91
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,570
critical or sensitive information this

92
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,550
is information pertaining to aspects of

93
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,840
the business that can be embarrassing or

94
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,799
detrimental to the business

95
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,090
if it gets made public or provided to

96
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,430
competitors etc yeah we're talking about

97
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,430
financial statements customer client

98
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,120
lists things along that line so it's

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,539
embarrassing its detrimental but in the

100
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,430
long run the company will recover it's

101
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,259
not gonna it's not in-game for a

102
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,630
business so we are worried about

103
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,880
critical and sensitive information so we

104
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,340
do need to bear it in mind confidential

105
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,819
and proprietary information this is

106
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,710
information that can be legally binding

107
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,690
central and critical to the business and

108
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,410
highly highly sensitive this is the kind

109
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,990
of data that has the potential and I

110
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,590
suggested potential to collapse or

111
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,199
reversibly damaged a business if made

112
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,099
public so let's think along the lines of

113
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:31,280
the supposedly secret recipe for

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,759
coca-cola Colonel Sanders X number of

115
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,349
herbs and spices whatever they claim to

116
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,250
have this today

117
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,520
environmental patents acquisition and

118
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,800
merger documents and negotiations this

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,960
is the sort of stuff that effort is made

120
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,169
public is extremely damaging to a

121
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,320
business pci-dss

122
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,900
MPA I data generally also falls under

123
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,000
confidential proprietary information so

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,560
we won't go to you and deep these ones

125
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,380
so payment card industry as sympho which

126
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,560
contains facets outlined by the PCI

127
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,080
security council and pertains to the

128
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,210
processing storage and transmission of

129
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,330
credit card data businesses that handle

130
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,729
payment gateways or large volumes of

131
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,699
credit card information no PCI DSS all

132
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:29,070
too well and they know how dreary and

133
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,050
painful it is and as we had discussions

134
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,650
on yesterday PII information it's

135
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,449
critical aspects of a person's identity

136
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,349
so anything that can be used to sell

137
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:47,539
your identity compromise your identity

138
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,000
now there is of course the government

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,640
defense categories of information secret

140
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,250
top secret traffic like protocol and the

141
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,380
likes but most of us here won't have

142
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,940
exposure into that so we won't go too

143
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,750
far in depth but most visual hacking

144
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,140
attempts is targeted towards the

145
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,510
critical sensitive and very much on the

146
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,870
confidential proprietary side of the

147
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,750
information spectrum it is up to an

148
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,470
individual business to classify what

149
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,540
their information is so the business

150
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,750
owners and information owners need to

151
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,940
have an understanding of what

152
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,430
information they have and they store and

153
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,410
how they handle that and how they

154
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,230
classify that in order for us as InfoSec

155
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,630
to adequately protect that information

156
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,150
but we're talking about visual hacking

157
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,600
here its 2017 just how vulnerable

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,000
actually are we you know we're living in

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,390
this new age of mobility with modern

160
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,630
video conferencing technologies internet

161
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,880
capabilities from the business

162
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,770
perspective international borders are a

163
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,500
thing of the past

164
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,660
corporations are truly multinational

165
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,620
entities and the world is more focused

166
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,290
on technical related security and

167
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,630
countermeasures then pretty much any

168
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,280
other time in history that means we're

169
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,070
actually now more susceptible to visual

170
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,620
hacking techniques then we were for

171
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,150
example at the height of the Cold War

172
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,120
where we've got all of the spy movies

173
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,590
and everything like that that puts the

174
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,850
fear into the two people and why is this

175
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,690
well there's a multitude of reasons

176
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,020
really first off the line between work

177
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,840
life and personal office space and home

178
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,750
it's more blurred than ever how many of

179
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,850
us are leaving the office and continuing

180
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,360
to work on the bus on the train airport

181
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,550
home pub we remember maybe we have more

182
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,440
and more portable devices that have the

183
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,290
storage capacity and/or Connacht

184
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,350
30 capabilities to essentially mean that

185
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,720
we've always got our entire office at

186
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,660
our fingertips wherever we may be and

187
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,449
that means that is a defined risk to

188
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:15,600
sensitive information in a numerous

189
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,120
number of environments that are outside

190
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,529
the control of the business but visual

191
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,029
hacking targets more than just business

192
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,459
information at a personal level

193
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,420
individuals me you everyone here our

194
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,069
prime and generally much easier targets

195
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:37,339
we're putting more of our lives online

196
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,380
our movements our relationships job

197
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,199
grievances on an increasing list of

198
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:47,040
social media platforms and yeah we've

199
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,569
all heard now of the nomophobia we've

200
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:50,220
got to make sure these devices are with

201
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,240
us we can't not have a mobile find their

202
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,440
hair come from today that now I was

203
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,790
actually looking over your shoulder what

204
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:03,120
you're looking at but again is 2017 so

205
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,699
I'm sure if someone was acting

206
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:08,850
suspiciously in our office looking over

207
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,199
our shoulders at our computer screens we

208
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:16,620
we got a notice aren't we well recently

209
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,889
in America the poem on instituted a

210
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,440
visual hacking experiment now this was

211
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,819
sponsored by 3m and basically involved a

212
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:31,380
unknown agency or temp worker coming in

213
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,829
and working at 3m for approximately a

214
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:36,480
week and one of the large American

215
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,380
officers and they although they're doing

216
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,110
the temping duties they were also on

217
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,779
behalf of the Institute trying to gain

218
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:50,910
access to and locate information of

219
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,339
interest throughout the course that

220
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:58,740
without being without being noticed the

221
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,069
success rate that that teamwork ahead of

222
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:09,920
locating information 88% that's huge

223
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,019
twenty percent of that information was

224
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,000
later deemed to be confident

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,600
shurl or proprietary or highly sensitive

226
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,950
an average of five pieces of sensitive

227
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,610
information was obtained in less than 15

228
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,370
minutes

229
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,680
47% of that information was gathered

230
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,430
from unattended discs printers resource

231
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:39,540
rooms and rubbish bins and it's andis

232
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,590
truly scary part is an estimated 70% of

233
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,270
these successful hacks

234
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,970
we're believed to have been witnessed

235
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,380
but not reported this means that 70% of

236
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,560
the visual hacking was not stopped by

237
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,510
the first line of defense which is your

238
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:09,330
employees okay I give familiarity we may

239
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:12,180
begin complacent in the office but we're

240
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,680
all mindful of our surroundings in

241
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,680
public right Iron Mountain another great

242
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,910
storage and security company they

243
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,060
released some research they conducted in

244
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,920
Europe and that highlights just how

245
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,580
prevalent shoulder surfing really is so

246
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,650
they focused in on public transport in

247
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,330
the UK and as I'm sure we can guess it

248
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,560
was shown that well a number of

249
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,780
commuters are actually looking over the

250
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,660
shoulder of the person next to them but

251
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,780
that percentage still pretty scarily

252
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,860
high one in 5 UK commuters have seen

253
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,589
someone else's confidential or highly

254
00:12:55,589 --> 00:12:58,560
sensitive information by sitting next to

255
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,430
them on a train on a bus etc and hey

256
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,830
please get back to the corporate

257
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,550
espionage example I used before

258
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:13,580
20% of in UK 20% of director level staff

259
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,920
find the airport business lounge fertile

260
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,650
ground for information gathering so

261
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:32,100
that's a pretty concerning again so how

262
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,060
does visual hacking actually work like

263
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,660
any form of information gathering visual

264
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,790
hacking takes a lot of practice and

265
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,600
attention to detail in order to succeed

266
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,610
the true skill comes with the ability to

267
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,150
identify targets of interest and absorb

268
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:54,360
the information on the fly now look

269
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,580
we're not talking about yeah Cameron the

270
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,370
bow ties finding the shoe sort of stuff

271
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,970
here we are talking about trained skin

272
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,760
readers who have the ability to absorb

273
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,640
critical information commit it to memory

274
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,960
and then carry on with supposed normal

275
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,860
duties often all in the time frame

276
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,980
ranging from well you know more than a

277
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,520
glance to 10-15 seconds so they've got

278
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,000
to be very accurate very fast and not be

279
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,710
noticed but the actual method how to do

280
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,570
it can be summed up quite easily with a

281
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:39,540
simple action and Christian statement so

282
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,570
although outwardly I'm performing some

283
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,800
designated duty

284
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,050
oh I'm walking through a space to a

285
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,590
define location nothing suspicious to

286
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,430
you however internally I have the

287
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:56,370
statement running through my head I take

288
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,240
a step

289
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,840
what can I see should I be able to see

290
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,750
it yes oh then I'm not worried about it

291
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,540
no interest so I take another step

292
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,370
what can I see Oh

293
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,170
her family is this someone's got the

294
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,960
passwords a condom on the monitor or on

295
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,230
their desk or some other places truly

296
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,950
and that is easily visible now yes I

297
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,650
know your password is not a true form of

298
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,450
information considering the definitions

299
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,940
we gave earlier but it is still valuable

300
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,810
information

301
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,180
if the visual hacking is actually part

302
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,300
of a wider automated campaign

303
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,740
we're able to harvest some credentials

304
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,640
it makes the process a bit easier for

305
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,470
some for the rest of the campaign I take

306
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:52,440
another steam what can I see we've got

307
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,210
print stations with uncollected

308
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:57,570
documents interesting to know what some

309
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,330
of that information is resource rooms

310
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,630
are an absolute goldmine it's one of the

311
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,000
few locations you can pick up someone

312
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
else's document and give it a cursory

313
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,300
glance and not raise any suspicions oh

314
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,420
sorry I thought that was my job and

315
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,040
let's go back to the agency worker that

316
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,710
we spoke about before and the poem on

317
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,380
experiment let's think about the kind of

318
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,620
work given to many agency temp staff

319
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,370
it is often menial tasks high-volume

320
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,000
printing or scanning so this means a lot

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,040
of justified room in an environment

322
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,440
which has a lot of exposure to sensitive

323
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,100
information

324
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,740
it's either left unclaimed on a printer

325
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,620
or in the actual material they've been

326
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,230
tasked with printing and scanning

327
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,120
something to be reminded some big going

328
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,440
are let's just bring in some team

329
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,140
resourcing to handle our file and print

330
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,990
migrations I take another step

331
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,910
what can I see unattended des with

332
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,550
visible papers bank statements legal

333
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,290
documents to change it company

334
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,950
directives paint and applications

335
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,579
everything you don't want made public

336
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,470
really and don't forget about the

337
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,410
rubbish bin often quite lots to be found

338
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,630
thrown in the bin especially towards the

339
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,210
end of the day I take another stick my

340
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,770
personal favorite unattended

341
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,599
workstations that have been left

342
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,620
unlocked one of the absolute PC iron and

343
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,280
faux set cardinal sins yet I see this in

344
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,250
every single company that I audit every

345
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,130
day and you won't believe what people

346
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,930
leave open on the desktops when they

347
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,410
walk away

348
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,370
so let's look at what is the mindset so

349
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:56,389
let's be realistic here

350
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,659
visual hacking in an office is not gonna

351
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:02,360
yield anything close to the volume of

352
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,779
data that a remote apt attack could

353
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:09,049
collect it requires a person on site and

354
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:14,360
it just doesn't scale try sitting in

355
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,519
someone's office space for 200 plus days

356
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,710
and collect information like a remote

357
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,429
attacker visually recording 60 million

358
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:26,860
items of data it's not going to happen

359
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,269
but try being in someone's office space

360
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,880
for a couple of days with a defined goal

361
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,480
of gaining information on I don't know a

362
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,059
particular legal matter that the is

363
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:40,730
going on that has the potential to

364
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,519
disrupt the business if accurate

365
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,399
allegations were made public and put in

366
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,070
the media now we're on the realms of

367
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:54,279
potential and becomes worth the effort

368
00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:04,429
so it's quantity versus quality of small

369
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:07,460
amounts of high-value information a

370
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,419
visual hacking campaign is very useful

371
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:15,679
for surgical targeted attacks all about

372
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,730
the quality of the info now look this is

373
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,889
all good and well for the office and

374
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:24,019
corporate environment isn't it but what

375
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:26,389
about the outside world what about you

376
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,429
and me what about the shoulder surfer on

377
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,639
the train they actually only want small

378
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:35,269
amounts of information generally only

379
00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:37,880
for a couple of purposes so they're not

380
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,279
targeting your business stuff they are

381
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,399
targeting you individually and what's

382
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,470
their mindset what are they wanting to

383
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,950
achieve well blackmail is a big one how

384
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,600
much is it worth to have the phrase I

385
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,360
know you are having an affair go away

386
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,539
and how did they discover that looking

387
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,230
over your shoulder

388
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,130
the other scenario gotcha this is that

389
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,190
whole Private Eye scenario where the

390
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,350
wife suspects their husband of something

391
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,270
and sets the wheels of motion of trying

392
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,100
to prove it so again you never know who

393
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,480
is looking at your device no matter

394
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,690
where you are sitting and stop and think

395
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,250
about some of the information that you

396
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,990
have up on that device while you're

397
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,420
sitting on the train on the bus in this

398
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:39,530
room for example let's start talking

399
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,840
about some of the mitigation so visual

400
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,890
hacking is a non tip based attack so we

401
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,820
need a non tech based defense strategy

402
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,080
in old money this is known as

403
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,590
operational security now

404
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,480
there's a lot of change of thought out

405
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,220
there and a lot of different opinions

406
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,500
but I firmly believe myself that the

407
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,440
foundations of info six oversee network

408
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,049
security all of the really juicy stuff

409
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:14,020
out there

410
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,730
the foundation is an ax solid

411
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,700
operational security I fail to see how a

412
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,390
firewall han ids/ips network perimeter

413
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,059
defenses can be truly successful if

414
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:28,520
they're implemented on a foundation of

415
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,730
shoddy OPSEC I just don't see how it is

416
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,690
gonna work now as a lot of people here

417
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,400
who know me know I can speak for hours

418
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,440
on the topic of operational security and

419
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,390
all the various facets of it but I'm

420
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,580
only just today I'm just focusing on how

421
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:49,010
it pertains to visual hacking there but

422
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,820
so in this case the most important

423
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,309
facets of ops ik is operative

424
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:04,010
development and in our cases the

425
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,860
operatives are our users so there's been

426
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,390
starting into the realms of user

427
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:13,580
development here now yesterday Nicklin

428
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,010
from cert gave us

429
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,659
fantastically brilliant rant on users

430
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:19,190
and the challenges of training them

431
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,490
making justify decisions etc and I agree

432
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,350
with everything he said be a hundred

433
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,299
percent however when it comes to ops it

434
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:32,390
and developing the overall culture of

435
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,000
awareness of what is happening in a

436
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,610
workspace got a little bit more faith as

437
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,159
long as we include ourselves and the

438
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,140
practice and not looking in from the

439
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,460
outside InfoSec professionals have got

440
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,309
if we can't keep rolling our eyes at the

441
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:52,460
word user we need to be proactive and

442
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,309
work with our users to create solutions

443
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:59,570
that work for them and the business if

444
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:03,380
users understand the problem that we are

445
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,530
trying to resolve and they understand

446
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,929
the solution to that problem

447
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,260
they are extremely likely to adhere to

448
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,770
that solution if they don't understand

449
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,130
the problem or we make the solution too

450
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,190
difficult they will not adhere to it

451
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:26,590
they will find bypasses or workarounds

452
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,210
now there's a lot of examples I can use

453
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,770
here I'm gonna pick on the low-hanging

454
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:35,260
fruit so let's focus in on passwords so

455
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,549
let's wake everyone up on a Saturday

456
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,440
morning to cook show of hands how many

457
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,929
people here I work in an environment

458
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:44,020
that enforces complex passwords

459
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,850
uppercase lowercase alphanumeric special

460
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,690
characters yep now keep your hands up if

461
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,860
you are 100 percent certain there is no

462
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,370
use of related password issues no one

463
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,110
has them written down on a little

464
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,360
post-it note or hidden under the

465
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,120
keyboard or at the back page of a diary

466
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,039
etc all the likely scenarios now here's

467
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,260
the interesting thing

468
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,690
even a by the name of Bill beer go

469
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,640
back a while he was the gem who first

470
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,039
published the dire need for complex

471
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:19,750
passwords

472
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,820
he's now come out and said they do not

473
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,049
work by making the requirements too

474
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,770
difficult for

475
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:35,330
users they are finding workarounds so

476
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,940
they're keeping them written down or

477
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,490
they keep the same password and just

478
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:43,300
advance the number at the end by one

479
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,890
four four cycles and then they revert

480
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,740
back to the original password stoning

481
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:54,140
sounds familiar to anyone so how do we

482
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,170
isn't foe sick working with our users to

483
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,530
make this process easier for them while

484
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,780
still maintaining the integrity of our

485
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,570
networks all these lots of other options

486
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,100
out there there's lots of different

487
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,110
things one of the big ones at the moment

488
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,580
that I personally quite like is a

489
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,120
passphrase / a password generally a lot

490
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,280
easier for a user to remember so you

491
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,480
listen to well how am I going to

492
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,090
remember a passphrase what's the opening

493
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,700
line to your favorite song here's a

494
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,130
great passphrase to start off with okay

495
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,780
most of our systems require us to put a

496
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,610
number or something in there but it is

497
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,010
easy for a users to remember we're

498
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,810
getting them involved in the thought

499
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,710
process still a struggle for a user to

500
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,200
remember we've all got one of these

501
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,510
users in our organization someone that

502
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,090
just cannot remember the time of day

503
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,040
they can't remember to go to the toilet

504
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,440
without being told they need to have it

505
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,770
written down and we've beaten our heads

506
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,150
on the desk towards black and blue

507
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,040
trying to get it through the head we

508
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,440
still need to work with these users to

509
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,570
get a solution in place that works for

510
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,920
them and the business so what can we do

511
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,450
let's use visual techniques ourselves

512
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,270
every desk has some form of generic memo

513
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:17,780
form flyer advertisement company

514
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,980
statement stuck on it and that is of no

515
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,320
value to anyone the information is

516
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,710
completely benign but the first four

517
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,630
words of row 6 actually still makes a

518
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,520
fantastic passphrase and it's something

519
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,250
that they can then remember I'm still

520
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,600
not advocating the thing of having

521
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,250
passwords written down because it's an

522
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,830
absolute cardinal sin but if it helps

523
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,630
our users as the workaround

524
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,480
well it does it builds that relationship

525
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,520
and obviously with passwords two-factor

526
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,350
is still the preferred but not all

527
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,970
businesses are ready to commit at this

528
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,860
to that strategy at this point in time

529
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,559
what else is here with ops II so look

530
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,260
we're focusing on actions that prevent

531
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,350
the spread of information outside our

532
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,330
perimeter of controls so well it's gonna

533
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,160
be focused on let's do print assessments

534
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,549
if I have a confidential proprietary

535
00:27:15,549 --> 00:27:18,200
document and that is saved in a file

536
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,500
repository I have a single instance one

537
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,120
instance of that document that I have to

538
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,460
protect okay admittedly a file

539
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,289
repository is a bit more complex to

540
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:29,929
protect and I'm not gonna get into you

541
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:31,610
ACS and all the other bits and pieces

542
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,250
today but it is still a single instance

543
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,640
to protect if I print the document I now

544
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,400
have two instances I need to protect and

545
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,220
I need to start considering disposal

546
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,429
options if I make this document

547
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,770
available to everyone on my office space

548
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,710
and they all print it I now start to

549
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,809
lose knowledge of how much how many

550
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,940
instances I have to protect and it's

551
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,580
very hard to protect something you don't

552
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,030
know exists so now we're going to more

553
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,809
user development back to the cultural

554
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,730
shift doesn't need to be printed if yes

555
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,010
what are you going to do with it once it

556
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,809
is printed where is it going to be

557
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:15,440
stored

558
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,140
going back to my auditing days remember

559
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,470
that a locked filing cabinet with a key

560
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,870
store hanging out of it is not a secure

561
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:30,650
location now and with printing while

562
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,020
there are some can be some technical

563
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,429
security concerns if they're not

564
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:37,940
configured correctly Follow Me style

565
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,100
print management is a strong mitigation

566
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,159
strategy to follow me print because from

567
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:45,559
an ops beat opposite perspective it

568
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:48,650
ensures that there are no unattended and

569
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,690
collected documents at a print station

570
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,980
to be viewed

571
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,650
let's talk about some secure disposal

572
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,110
methods as soon as a printed document

573
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:04,030
makes its way into a public space

574
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:07,640
including a dumpster escape outside the

575
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,670
secure perimeter of your building it is

576
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,070
classified as being in the public domain

577
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,290
and you lose all rights to the

578
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,290
information held on that document it has

579
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:21,020
been placed into the public by your

580
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,929
business so you want to make sure it's

581
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,809
in an unreadable and an unreadable state

582
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:30,020
before it leaves your premise so here

583
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,220
we've got crosscut shredding now I

584
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,830
emphasize crosscut anyone familiar with

585
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,280
say the Watergate incident or the second

586
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,429
of the US Embassy in Iran will know that

587
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:45,650
straight shredding is actually

588
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,920
relatively easy to reassemble and still

589
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:53,090
get access to the information there now

590
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,670
the main way of handling disposal is

591
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,820
incineration and they're both for both

592
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,830
of these options there is in house and

593
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,860
third party options that can be

594
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,350
investigated if you want to put their

595
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,480
onus of responsibility beer onto a third

596
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,480
party so look we are not simply training

597
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,990
users as mentioned yesterday and as I'm

598
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:23,210
going to reiterate training gets

599
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:27,230
forgotten training is used to tick a box

600
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,500
with HR it's just going through the

601
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,020
processes we're talking about user

602
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,679
development specifically use a culture

603
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:38,990
development developing a culture of

604
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:41,929
awareness of what is going on in the

605
00:30:41,929 --> 00:30:45,140
office space the culture we are asking

606
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,750
simple questions like does this need to

607
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,500
be printed should this item be visible

608
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,000
who is this person walking around my

609
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,230
office space making that culture so that

610
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,720
asking those questions is not enforced

611
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,840
but second nature now this is one of the

612
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,929
best method mitigative strategies you

613
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,800
can have against

614
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,700
hacking Oh

615
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,290
sorry we've also got things like privacy

616
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,220
screens that we can put on monitors etc

617
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:21,120
but aside from the human factor there

618
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,190
are some premise level strategies that

619
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:26,240
can also be used as a defensive mean a

620
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,500
defensive measure this is a term you not

621
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,120
many people may have encountered before

622
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,180
some of you may see pts or crime

623
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,870
prevention through Environmental Design

624
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,120
now this is primarily focused on

625
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,990
physical security but there are some

626
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,890
concepts that cross into opsi so CPTED

627
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,530
refers to design strategies that are

628
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,810
used to deter an intruder from

629
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,120
attempting to break in or access a

630
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,180
building and often these are deterrents

631
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,620
that have built in at a subconscious

632
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,730
level

633
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,020
so examples overall would be planting

634
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,740
hedgerow setting that bench seedings

635
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,960
installation of signage that all looks

636
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,200
like standard practice but has actually

637
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,090
specifically designed subconsciously

638
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:21,470
direct people onto a designated pathway

639
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,210
which in turn is monitored by head and

640
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,570
CCTV so you are subconsciously directing

641
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,460
people who are coming onto your grounds

642
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,550
to follow the path that you want them to

643
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,080
follow and not to go off on their own

644
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,880
tangent at night it uses lighting zones

645
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,870
clearly visible CCTV barricades etc to

646
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:46,920
again subconsciously direct people into

647
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,170
the areas that you want them and not the

648
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,000
parts not approaching the building from

649
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,060
areas you don't want them in so if

650
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,070
you've got access to the buildings where

651
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,760
there may be doors you have large areas

652
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,160
of bright lighting in front of that so

653
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,960
that you can not be not approaching

654
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,560
access point unseen but how does it

655
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,700
relate to visual hacking that's where it

656
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,500
comes in to once someone is inside your

657
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,290
building now that's where crime

658
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,640
prevention through Environmental Design

659
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,220
can offer your protection in providing

660
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:30,570
guidance on your office layout now this

661
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,420
has got a somewhat obscured name of a

662
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,310
work styles assessment so what does that

663
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:41,460
actually mean so the way every office it

664
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,780
seems to be going at the moment these

665
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,800
have another show of hands here who here

666
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,800
works in an open plain office yep how

667
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,200
much thought do you really think went

668
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,740
into the layout of that office a lot not

669
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,310
a lot desert I'm seeing a lot of zeros

670
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:06,390
being held up here so a work style

671
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,150
assessment will look at the proposed

672
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,639
floor plate of an office space and will

673
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,250
be in survey each individual and

674
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,070
department working in that space this

675
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,469
assessment will be asking questions such

676
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:23,520
as are you primarily office or dis based

677
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,159
it does your job role require you to do

678
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,280
a lot of printing do you attend a lot of

679
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,380
meetings do you spend all day at your

680
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,540
desk do you have a lot of small

681
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,000
one-on-one huddle sessions at your desk

682
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,250
or it's some soft furnishings do two or

683
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,830
three people at a soft couch an area

684
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:46,560
near your desk the proposed breakout

685
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,380
spaces on the floor plate what level of

686
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,980
sensitive information do you handle on a

687
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,550
daily basis

688
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:59,490
now the results of the survey will then

689
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,030
provide some guidance on where people

690
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,420
are best situated to see with a net

691
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,350
floor plate this is going back to the

692
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:13,380
Environmental Design and some in your

693
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,640
operational security

694
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,460
so hey you're a field worker you've

695
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,140
spent a lot of your time actually out of

696
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,470
the office making sales tools out in the

697
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,240
field doing whatever it is that you're

698
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,450
required to do so you get a desk close

699
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,550
to the door so not to disturb others

700
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,200
with all of your comings and goings

701
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,690
sorry you don't get a window seat don't

702
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,380
need it no

703
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,990
how much you want it bad luck this is

704
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,240
the location that's best suited to your

705
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,460
working style and we're going to give

706
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,320
the nice window seat to someone that's a

707
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,910
bit more discount for the course of the

708
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,880
day if you're a high-volume

709
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,640
printer then you get located closer to

710
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,650
the printers to the resource rooms to

711
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,840
the print stations same principle

712
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,880
applies for those with regular meetings

713
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,770
have them close to meeting rooms so

714
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,480
defensive strategy for those who are

715
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,850
most likely to be targeted by a visual

716
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,160
hacker based on the level of information

717
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,720
that they handle we look for a desk that

718
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,340
is distant from the entry points seated

719
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,970
with their back to a wall not back into

720
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,070
the remainder of the office or even

721
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:28,680
worse a window not seated in

722
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,720
high-traffic areas high foot traffic

723
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,190
areas not near the meeting rooms or

724
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,760
breakout spaces or soft furnishings etc

725
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,430
have them essentially we are aiming to

726
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,890
place targeted users and locations we

727
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,190
are a visual hacker has no reason to

728
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,000
approach them or their workspace unless

729
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,580
they are directly speaking to the target

730
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,030
and the more complex of wallplate the

731
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:00,980
better defense is provided so by having

732
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,850
users of high sensitive information kind

733
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,680
of huddled away with they're harder to

734
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,790
approach it is making them more secure

735
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:13,260
just by the environment they are setting

736
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,420
them so little bit tricky to see

737
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,430
hopefully we can make it do here so this

738
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,380
is actually one of the projects I've

739
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,130
been recently working on so how would I

740
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,660
be working it here so I've got main

741
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,360
entrances in therapy is starting

742
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,940
I've got stairways here stairways here

743
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:38,550
so that's going to be high therapy areas

744
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,420
I have a resource room just here so

745
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,860
that's going to have a high foot traffic

746
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,210
area because these

747
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,580
lots of people walking in and out I have

748
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,190
meeting rooms down the middle of the

749
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,280
building is which I know a glass-fronted

750
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,060
again not a good location around them I

751
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,390
have a lot of areas where I've got soft

752
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,000
furnishings little huddle breakout

753
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,790
tables mat layout here is etc etc so

754
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,530
these are the sort of areas that I would

755
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,920
specifically be aiming to avoid so if

756
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,920
I'm focusing on on this floor plan

757
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,869
I'd be kin taking all this into example

758
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,580
and I'd be looking more closely down

759
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:29,630
here please zoom it up a little bit so

760
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,619
first thing I'll be doing is just

761
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,960
rotating these discs around I know these

762
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,820
are solid walls so are we having the

763
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,560
station so that the back is to the wall

764
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,589
and not to the remainder of the office

765
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:46,140
but I also know I am distant from the

766
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,990
high foot traffic areas from the

767
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:52,380
entrances em as an added bonus I also

768
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,820
have these structural barricades here so

769
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,140
this area here would be great location

770
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,000
to have people who have got who

771
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,770
regularly handled this confidential

772
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,720
sense of sales of information so what

773
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,369
I'll do is we will wrap it up here thank

774
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:18,240
you very much I will open up if anyone

775
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,550
does have any further questions did I

776
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,730
can

777
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,450
probably the most high-risk thing that

778
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,030
I've encountered is not so much from the

779
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:51,020
visually I speak but it was fear I was

780
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,350
wanting a property that will remain

781
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,780
nameless that handling and credit card

782
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,390
information we had recently gone through

783
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:19,500
a refresh and I actually have this back

784
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:47,280
home and found that and it was the most

785
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,610
to me

786
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:59,580
she has actually been successful making

787
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,910
security

788
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,200
it's a double-sided question because the

789
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,800
more doors that you had what my students

790
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,430
have told me that the more officers that

791
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,770
you have series you hey the more next

792
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:29,100
day sees what a neat game like these I

793
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,880
don't need to worry about mobilization

794
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:43,140
exceeding just because it doesn't so my

795
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,940
personal experience is actually being

796
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,680
that those
