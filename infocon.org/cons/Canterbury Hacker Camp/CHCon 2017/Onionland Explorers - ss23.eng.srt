1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,310
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,200
hey everyone while I'm getting my

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,180
clicker sit up I got a joke for you

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,490
what's Equifax is least favorite

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,880
vegetable it's leeks Oh Mike look it

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,050
doesn't work just have it on switch oh

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,080
look at that okay okay so we're gonna be

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,240
talking about tour and we'll jump right

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,930
in

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,789
it's for accessing the internet or

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,070
hidden services so hands up if any of

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,410
you have used tor to access the internet

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,450
like at a school university bypass

14
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,110
censorship right so that's used in China

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,700
anywhere else there since the ship you

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,170
can use it to access the internet hands

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,910
up if anyone's brought drugs on the

18
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,660
darknet we got one hand so the rest of

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,379
you are doing good so that's the first

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,079
rule don't tell anyone so we're going to

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,629
talk about some of these modes I'm going

22
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,160
to start with how it works so use it

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,879
Onion Routing

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,859
tor has layers hints onions now there's

25
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,019
a tall client and the Tor network in the

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,670
middle and then the destination so

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,950
assuming we go into google.com

28
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,909
we talk to the entry guard first and

29
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,049
that connection is encrypted so the

30
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:14,549
entry guard knows who we are and he

31
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,070
receives an encrypted packet he decrypts

32
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,619
the first layer and it says fought it to

33
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,369
the middle relay now the middle rellenos

34
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:24,390
basically nothing he doesn't know who we

35
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,640
got the packet from but he doesn't know

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,500
where it's going the exit relay and the

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,210
exit relay knows where the destination

38
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,700
is but not who sent it so each of these

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,290
nodes doesn't have enough to do naanum

40
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,299
eyes-u one knows who you are but no were

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,500
you going and one knows where you're

42
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,630
going but not who you are so that's the

43
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,960
core of how the anonymity of Tor works

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,090
here are some other diagrams showing it

45
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,329
it's very simple this one is even more

46
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,220
simple so you can see cause really

47
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,710
simple but that doesn't contrast to how

48
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,659
hidden services work so this is the

49
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,549
other kind of internet access where

50
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,600
you're going to Silk Road onion there's

51
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,030
lots of errors lots of boxes multiple

52
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,380
shapes this one has a picture of an

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,210
onion so it's got more stuff going on

54
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,310
this one has three different levels so

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,348
the key thing here is it's really

56
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,360
complicated and if you use them you're

57
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,909
gonna be hacked

58
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:17,010
like this but we will go over briefly

59
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,389
how it does work so hidden server which

60
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:23,670
is like Silk Road talks to a random tool

61
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,129
note and says if anyone comes to you

62
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,409
they want to talk to me then it tells

63
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,349
the directory service hey I'm available

64
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:33,569
now then the client talks at the

65
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:34,889
directory services and says where do I

66
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,810
go to find Silk Road he goes to that

67
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,480
previously mentioned node and they can

68
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,549
now talk to each other they talk via a

69
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:44,609
rendezvous point so the same thing

70
00:02:44,609 --> 00:02:46,560
exists here where each of these has over

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,709
a tor node so no one will even know who

72
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,260
runs Silk Road hopefully but that's what

73
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,040
the talks about and then the client also

74
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,359
will need to be identified by the server

75
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:58,680
the directory service won't know who the

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,060
client is and it's a system where you

77
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,949
can access a website without anyone

78
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,780
knowing who is accessing the website or

79
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,409
who's hosting the website and here are

80
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,419
the many complicated diagrams showing

81
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:09,930
how it works

82
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,409
it's very complicated so we're gonna

83
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:14,849
talk about some real word attacks on

84
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:17,519
this system we're gonna talk about

85
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,199
attacks on the protocol that it is not

86
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,090
designed to protect against we're gonna

87
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,290
talk about something is designed to

88
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,509
predict against attacks on the Tor

89
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:27,900
software itself attacks on the end user

90
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,629
client software like the tor browser

91
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,370
attacks on end user idiocy which is

92
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,650
always a fun section and attacks on end

93
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,840
user server software so that's are the

94
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,169
people running the actual web sites so

95
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:41,609
it's really important to understand the

96
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,439
threat model of Tor because it's not

97
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,870
actually gonna protect you against the

98
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,449
NSA any global passive adversary someone

99
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:50,069
who can observe a significant portion of

100
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,620
Internet traffic you're screwed they can

101
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,870
find out who you are and that's see it

102
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,549
in the design Docs so it's not some

103
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:58,290
hidden secret or intentionally goes out

104
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,819
of the way to not protect against the

105
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,829
scenario so if you're one of these guys

106
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:04,769
you are in for a very bad time because I

107
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,540
happen to know the NSA doesn't like them

108
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,000
so it's going to not work out good for

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,269
them

110
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:11,609
so a global person over Cerie someone

111
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,349
who can monitor all of the internet or a

112
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,090
significant portion of it candy

113
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,969
anonymize people using tor that doesn't

114
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:19,440
mean that they can always decrypt the

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,909
traffic and it doesn't mean they can

116
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:23,130
always do naanum eyes you it depends

117
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,289
exactly on how much they're looking at

118
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,300
but that's the general idea

119
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,360
gonna protect you from those people but

120
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,099
there are some protocol attacks it is

121
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,110
going to predict you against where it's

122
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,539
meant to so this is a really great paper

123
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:39,690
that came out very early when tor first

124
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,560
was around and the important thing to

125
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,629
note here is that only hackers use BSD

126
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:49,430
look he's using BSD so so we know that

127
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,819
now

128
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,430
a hidden server as we talked about when

129
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,900
you talk to where it's going over tor

130
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,460
right so each of the nodes is over tor

131
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,159
these are just a pool of servers that

132
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:02,250
someone said hey use this at all here's

133
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,340
some traffic he's basically a server

134
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,110
that you can use the bandwidth for over

135
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,849
the Tor network so if you are running a

136
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,530
tour relay you can be that first node

137
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,520
you can also be 2 & 3 so you talk to the

138
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
rendezvous point and the head and server

139
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,599
talks to you and if you happen to be

140
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,819
number 3 for example well you'll know

141
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:25,379
because you'll say I know the rendezvous

142
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:27,539
point and you can then seen traffic like

143
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:29,190
if you've seen Tim bites a traffic 50

144
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,900
bytes came by it's 50 bytes to in bytes

145
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,789
you can look at the traffic and even

146
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:34,560
though you don't know who the who the

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,319
person is you can say oh this amount of

148
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,080
traffic correlates with me connecting to

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,060
Silk Road I must be on the circuit that

150
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,900
Silk Road has on

151
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,630
if you're number two of course you'll

152
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,430
say the two servers I'm talking to

153
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,080
either side of me are listed as tor

154
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,669
nodes I can look that up and see all the

155
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,520
tor nodes there for number two lastly if

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,770
you're number one you can say I'm

157
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,259
talking to a tor node on one side and a

158
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,000
server that's not tor on the other side

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,360
and I know I'm connecting to Silk Road

160
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,370
therefore that must be Silk Road so

161
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,650
that's kind of the first attack that I

162
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,080
saw against Roy and this was fixed very

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,900
very early on and the way they fixed it

164
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,120
was by having a special Club here called

165
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,940
entry guard nodes and that's that very

166
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,400
first section is really critical right

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,139
because if someone can identify that via

168
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,409
the first dude for Silk Road they can

169
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,849
identify who's Aguero's because they're

170
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,889
just that connections made just over the

171
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,969
Internet

172
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:31,740
but there are some issues with this

173
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,880
because it's just a club right if it's

174
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,169
not exclusive enough and you can get

175
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:38,490
into that Club or you can do the same

176
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,220
attack or you could just kill

177
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,530
DDoS everyone in the club and then if

178
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,410
super wants to stay up they have to they

179
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,480
have to basically pick another entry

180
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,520
node and every time they pick a new one

181
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,410
they could be picking yours which means

182
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,050
you could be able to do in almost Silk

183
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,800
Road now in practice this means if

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,320
someone's willing to pay a lot of money

185
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,790
they can do you not amazed your server

186
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,200
and this isn't true in the future for

187
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,760
long because of some mitigations we're

188
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,260
going to talk about but that's kind of

189
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,870
where it stands today is that if someone

190
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,940
has enough money they can do Donna Mize

191
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,890
you they set up a high bandwidth relay

192
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,100
you pick it and they just force you to

193
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,080
pick up by ddossing or knocking off

194
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,180
nodes or whatnot and then you can be

195
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,210
that number one node now the other

196
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,890
mitigation against it is that when you

197
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,660
pick that first node when Silk Road

198
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,370
decides okay this is the first guy that

199
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,919
I'm going to go to taxes anyone on the

200
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,930
internet that gets locked in that's

201
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,640
called a guard node and they get rotated

202
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,580
out very infrequently so as people have

203
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,430
found more sneaky ways of becoming that

204
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,180
first node

205
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,860
they basically increase that length and

206
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,270
say well now we're only going to rotate

207
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,190
that out once a month and if you're not

208
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,390
the if it once a month you only get one

209
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,790
chance to do it and then once every two

210
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,900
months and I think it's up to something

211
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,520
like once every six months at the moment

212
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,890
and it basically means that if you're

213
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,600
not getting if you're not getting reap

214
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,310
icked in that six month period you've

215
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,740
got six months where you can't really do

216
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,840
not amaizing so that's all about raising

217
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,680
that cost right but it still exists if

218
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,880
someone's willing to pay enough you're

219
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,140
still pretty screwed now someone carried

220
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,190
out attack very similar to this on the

221
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,190
real Tor network and it was you city

222
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,550
anonymize people and interestingly we

223
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,950
saw that there was a black hat 2014 talk

224
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,720
which talked about techniques to zone ID

225
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,240
anonymized tor users it got pulled for

226
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,039
legal reasons and then shortly

227
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,299
afterwards we saw this attack on the

228
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,549
real Tor network so this kind of just

229
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:41,429
goes to show that someone with legal

230
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,770
sway is interested in D anonymizing tall

231
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,710
servers can't imagine who it would be

232
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,660
and then of course CMU when they got

233
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,910
asked they were like well they got

234
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,410
accusative basically selling the exploit

235
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,520
and they were like well we don't get

236
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,980
paid for complying with subpoenas

237
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,860
so take from that what you will

238
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,540
now of course the defense for this

239
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,940
that's currently a proposal I don't

240
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,040
think it's been implemented yet is

241
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,880
defending against guard

242
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,010
discovery attacks using van guards and

243
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,530
this basically means at every step one

244
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,060
two and three in that diagram we looked

245
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,930
at before lock them in so at the moment

246
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,540
you can pick two and three and you can

247
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,280
then D anonymize who the garden of it is

248
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,260
who that first guy is and then say I'm

249
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,090
gonna ddos him so Silk Road wants to

250
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,460
help they have to pick a new one this

251
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,280
here basically extends that out to every

252
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,940
node in the system so you can never kind

253
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,710
of reach forward further if you do

254
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,270
you're not going to get far enough

255
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,830
forward or if you in the middle you

256
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,960
can't tell that kind of thing and so

257
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,190
this is something that kind of

258
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,080
exponentially decreases how likely it is

259
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,190
that you'll be able to carry out this

260
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,030
attack in practice but maybe this

261
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,260
proposal is only been out for something

262
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,690
like six months so it's really

263
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,850
interesting to see tour still developing

264
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,530
these defenses and techniques and

265
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,180
whatnot to kind of keep it secure

266
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,880
against everything attacks on the tour

267
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,520
Damon if you search there are only eight

268
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,190
CVEs listed against the tour Damon

269
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,560
so that's really really good especially

270
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,840
when you consider against Firefox one

271
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,770
four six eight matches not very good I

272
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,190
feel bad for any Firefox users now this

273
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,100
is the most common attack as a tall user

274
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,150
you're going to be dealing with it

275
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,530
doesn't matter if you're doing anything

276
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,510
illegal or just using it to access a

277
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,060
hidden site with a blog right we saw

278
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,950
with freedom hosting which is a big

279
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,770
hosting provider for tour and not

280
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,300
associated with tor at all but they were

281
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,230
just running a hosting service

282
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,390
accessible through tor they got

283
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:43,910
identified by the FBI they took down

284
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,870
everything there but when they did it

285
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,150
they replaced every site freedom hosting

286
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,340
was hot serving they embedded like a

287
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,590
malicious JavaScript they used a node a

288
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,690
and Firefox Indian on a anonymized

289
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,280
anyone so that doesn't mean you have to

290
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,270
be doing anything illegal

291
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,740
you could still be targeted by these

292
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,010
exploits just because you're using tor

293
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,660
now there are mitigations against this

294
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,280
of course you could use a real browser

295
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,340
like Chrome or you could rewrite Firefox

296
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,000
these are

297
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,340
really practical though the tor browser

298
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,410
bundle is really good at doing what it

299
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,470
does and migrating that functionality to

300
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:18,210
Chrome is really hard

301
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,150
rewriting Firefox I would definitely not

302
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,950
be able to be the one to do that so

303
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,830
probably not going to happen

304
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,480
alternative mitigations are turning on

305
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,400
no script right is if you turn on no

306
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,250
script no JavaScript is going to execute

307
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,460
drastically reduce your attack surface

308
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,980
so if you are using tor and you want to

309
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,140
buy drugs or anything else and it's like

310
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,030
hey enable JavaScript to log in don't do

311
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,210
it it's a trap go to a different drug

312
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:51,540
market so attacks on end-user idiocy so

313
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,950
this is a guy he didn't want to do an

314
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,440
exam and he was like I'll just email a

315
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,360
bomb threat that'll work great because

316
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,260
it's tor it'll be anonymous doesn't work

317
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,300
so well because the university admins

318
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,250
were just like who is using tor in this

319
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,780
bomb through it was emailed oh is that

320
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,490
one guy in the dorms we should probably

321
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,290
go talk to him they we didn't talk to

322
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,580
him they're late did you do it and he

323
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,860
was like yes I'm really sorry I did it

324
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,640
so tor isn't gonna protect you from that

325
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,260
kind of thing this guy was really silly

326
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,240
I can see how you could make mistake but

327
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,820
I really hope no one else makes it so

328
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,339
don't crack under interrogation so

329
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,150
that's a bad one never talk to cops man

330
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,800
and don't be an inspector all to be

331
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,810
undetectable just because it's anonymous

332
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,460
doesn't mean people won't know you're

333
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,830
using it and sometimes that's all they

334
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,000
need if they can see like a lot of FBI

335
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,930
investigations involved parking outside

336
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,970
someone's house and being like oh

337
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,560
through the Wi-Fi traffic we can tell

338
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,960
you season two or whatever if someone

339
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,820
knows you're using tor then that might

340
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,560
be enough to do you naanum eyes you for

341
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,839
your circumstances you stick out pretty

342
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,600
bad using it so the last section is

343
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,660
attacks on end-user server software so

344
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,400
this is the software that runs Silk Road

345
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,750
or the software that runs freedom

346
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,450
hosting or anything like that now I

347
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,670
don't do any like Firefox exploit that's

348
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,380
really hard but what I do do is like PHP

349
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,410
exploits or I'll like download exploit

350
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,610
from somewhere and run that against your

351
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,770
server that's really easy so that's

352
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,440
where I definitely enjoy doing stuff so

353
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,330
we're gonna have a live demo we're gonna

354
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,680
look at onion scan

355
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,850
which is software made by sir I think

356
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,390
además that will check a bunch of D

357
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,790
anonymization techniques against a tor

358
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,680
hidden service so you could run this

359
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,480
today on any hidden service and it'll

360
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,510
check for really basic things that maybe

361
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,709
you can figure drawn so we're gonna run

362
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,870
them against one that I've set up yep

363
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,540
cool I'm getting type so this should be

364
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,390
alright Oh No Twitter notifications are

365
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:58,800
coming up there's too many oh my

366
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,970
goodness okay so here is a tor hidden

367
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,540
service but we are accessing it over the

368
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,700
public Internet right so five two is an

369
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,070
ad with IP address we're gonna go here

370
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,560
server - status and we cannot access

371
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,420
that right because that would be really

372
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,080
silly but if I go across here and I

373
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,070
restart the session

374
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,410
[Music]

375
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,940
well no I shouldn't shouldn't have done

376
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,010
this here so here's the same one here

377
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,510
and we're gonna run onion skin on it so

378
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:49,270
it's accessible via adding in URL but do

379
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:55,190
just copy-paste this okay now we may go

380
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,380
here this is the donggun we're gonna do

381
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,550
the same thing - server status and

382
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,530
assuming my internet is working come on

383
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:06,290
internet it should hopefully show us

384
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,200
this so here we have the approach Apache

385
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
server status for this site for those

386
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,780
who don't know this can often be used 2d

387
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,970
anonymizer server so we can see a bunch

388
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,500
of requests here and we can see that

389
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,700
these are all coming from the internet

390
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,510
so I presume everyone just scans it's a

391
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,520
de beers for exploits I didn't set these

392
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,320
up this is just on the internet so it's

393
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,310
been scanned you can see real-world IP

394
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,560
addresses in here right so if I was

395
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,480
accessing the site to administer it via

396
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,100
a real-world IP address it would be

397
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,200
completely visible here you'd be able to

398
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,730
see it and immediately you'd be ID

399
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,220
anonymize me if you had any personal

400
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,780
information here if you were going to

401
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,030
slash admin or something like that that

402
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,040
would be visible here now it's

403
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,180
interesting you think why does this

404
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,860
happen right because you would really

405
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,480
hope that by default software isn't

406
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,190
going to expose you like this this is

407
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,390
really sensitive information to have

408
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,570
exposed so so here we can see onion scan

409
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,900
it's picked up a bunch of stuff only one

410
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,030
critical it's checking public IP

411
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,260
addresses clear ticks links that kind of

412
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,300
thing anything else that will find here

413
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,500
as well sort of do like favicon

414
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,880
detection and you can use it to

415
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,320
correlate things as well so you'll be

416
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,970
like oh it has the same PC sage key is

417
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,980
this other server I saw it's probably

418
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,010
the same site or same server rather with

419
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,620
a single hidden site on it multiple

420
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,180
hidden sites on it rather so you need it

421
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,860
to correlate and see who's hosting what

422
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,400
that kind of thing so if we just quickly

423
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,590
look at this so

424
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:41,529
scheme okay hopefully is that visible am

425
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,040
I gonna make it bigger once again I

426
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,770
don't have any more jokes so it's got

427
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,400
nothing for you right now

428
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,220
oh yeah hopefully that's visible so I

429
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,509
will grab what I'm looking for this is

430
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:06,630
the 100% default in us all apart from

431
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,119
these two lines here can you see them

432
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:12,349
it's a little bit cut off the gist is

433
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,699
these two lines here so all we're saying

434
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,789
is there's a hidden service where we're

435
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,349
storing information in a directory and

436
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,480
this is how you access it now you might

437
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,650
at this point realize what's happened

438
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,599
with Apache we're accessing it over

439
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,359
localhost right we're saying the tour de

440
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,710
Melissa's in the internet but it

441
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,360
connects back to Apache of a local host

442
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,970
so of course if you look at the Apache

443
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:43,320
configuration one of the ones here you

444
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,090
can see it require local so the only

445
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,789
thing that's required to access / /

446
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,230
saito-san Apache is that your existing

447
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,270
it locally tor is accessing it locally

448
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,429
so any application you have that you're

449
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:55,169
hosting on tour if you have anything

450
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:56,640
like oh if it's coming from localhost

451
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,799
treated differently really bad idea

452
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,090
everything is going to be coming from

453
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,730
localhost any logging you have that

454
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,350
tries to log IP addresses that's not

455
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,120
gonna work the entire idea behind tor is

456
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,980
that it hides your IP address people

457
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,720
make this kind of mistake a lot this is

458
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,090
a default install right if you didn't

459
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,559
already know about it you wouldn't even

460
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,630
think to check so that's one of the ways

461
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,549
people do get caught with this kind of

462
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:21,390
thing so that is over but if you're

463
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,679
interested in I highly recommend you

464
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,600
check out onion scan the cheeks for a

465
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,890
lot more so it's a really interesting

466
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:36,990
software that did this Mike yeah so it

467
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,789
checks for lots of things this is

468
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,400
default install no trickery or anything

469
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,240
and you can do naanum eyes it so we saw

470
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,610
something really similar this with Silk

471
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,830
Road where it wasn't it wasn't mod

472
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,070
status enabled but the Silk Road guy as

473
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,870
he was developing his website Dre Pirate

474
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,669
Roberts he wasn't a very good developer

475
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,929
and he definitely didn't know about

476
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,360
DevOps he was debugging in production

477
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,460
and it was just like Oh dump out all the

478
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,440
server information so I can debug this

479
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,929
issue and then someone made this three

480
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:09,149
it should be we be worried showing on

481
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:12,870
login page and it contained enough

482
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,910
to at least give the FBI a head start on

483
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,130
D anonymizing them we didn't see exactly

484
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,320
what this information was used for but

485
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,900
in the FBI of stuff that got released

486
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,940
they talked about oh we entered

487
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,500
something on the login page and we got

488
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,270
enough back to start D anonymizing them

489
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,380
and so you know your service software

490
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,360
don't work in production if you're

491
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,750
running a drug a drug market but you

492
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,190
know this information has really

493
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,920
sensitive so there's two takeaways from

494
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,560
it right if your server is on the public

495
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,120
Internet you're going to have a bad time

496
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,480
it doesn't matter how you configure it

497
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,260
someone's probably going to be able to

498
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,000
break it right we know there's bugs at

499
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,190
everything I doubt anyone can write

500
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,160
server software so the software that's

501
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,630
secure it's just not going to happen

502
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,620
you're always going to be able to be

503
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,080
hacked somehow and then you can always

504
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,110
correlate things if one hidden services

505
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,970
here once here you can correlate and say

506
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,320
they're on the same server if you're

507
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,240
hosting your personal blog on tour on

508
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,430
one and your target market on the other

509
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,860
it's fairly common to be able to

510
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,990
correlate that an onion scare does a lot

511
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,710
of that for you

512
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,470
so stop giving your hidden services

513
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,030
access to the public Internet and stop

514
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,470
using them for more than one client you

515
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,670
know we have virtual machines we could

516
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,570
deal with this so to that end I built

517
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,720
something to run to hosting so it's like

518
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,990
hosting but it's based on crux portal of

519
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,260
PI and his was you run it on a Raspberry

520
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,810
Pi in line so you go router Raspberry Pi

521
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,550
your computer and it'll ensure

522
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,400
everything goes over tor so as a user of

523
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,070
tor if you get hacked if you open a

524
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,060
phishing link you want to make sure

525
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,780
you're not do naanum eyes so the one

526
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,240
that I built users don't require trust

527
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,220
to use it you're accessing it over tor

528
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,660
which means if you want to host

529
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,460
something you know the other person

530
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,480
can't find your IP address right so

531
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,550
anyone can use it so I ran it in the

532
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,250
real world because I'm an idiot I didn't

533
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,290
take any money for it because I thought

534
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,720
if I do go to court for it and the jury

535
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,310
is like oh you got money I'm gonna go to

536
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,110
prison but if I'm like oh it's just

537
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,000
research they'll be like yeah that's

538
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,430
fine he didn't go away with it I'm not a

539
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:23,510
lawyer but I think that's how it works

540
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,759
so I was running it for a while

541
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,769
and I have this message pop up I'm gonna

542
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,960
read it because it's it's great I have a

543
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,490
gag reflex hopefully I can get through

544
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,289
it hello

545
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:36,299
is it okay according to your policy to

546
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,940
create a fetishist VM for scat and piss

547
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,789
lovers 18 plus year old some of the

548
00:21:41,789 --> 00:21:44,309
products pooped Bonnie's vacuum-sealed

549
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:46,980
miss panties vacuum sealed piston and

550
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,850
x-file scat cupcakes mini cupcakes of

551
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,009
various flavors with a young he's kept

552
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:56,639
filling real photos polaroid and maybe

553
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:57,059
vids

554
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,759
like this it's taken off my hosting has

555
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,080
taken off her from getting messages like

556
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,129
this so I had rules about why you could

557
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:09,210
host on it nothing immoral which means a

558
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,700
large amount of pornography is out no

559
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,119
dark name rather no terrorist activity

560
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,480
the NSA would screw me if I did that but

561
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,889
like if you wanted to sell drugs in

562
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:20,999
there I'd totally be okay with that

563
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:24,090
I'm all for drugs so more of that so

564
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,289
what did I actually have because I was

565
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,029
hosting it for a while I had two people

566
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,009
emailed me whenever it went down and I

567
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,360
was like yeah I know I just took it down

568
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,509
I had multiple political and

569
00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:35,070
informational blogs which was really

570
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,389
interesting people just want a place to

571
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:39,720
host whatever weird views they have an

572
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,690
IP proxy service which is another

573
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,629
anonymization network and I guess this

574
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,159
is just more about providing their

575
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,230
bandwidth for that through this and

576
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,210
there was one likes in Bitcoin received

577
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,220
child pornography and you just delete

578
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,080
that right I had full visibility over

579
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,240
what people were hosting even though I

580
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,440
didn't know who they were so I was

581
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,179
really easily that kind of thing but I

582
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,129
was really interested to see what

583
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:03,269
actually came up right there was

584
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:05,490
actually almost no people doing dodgy

585
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,559
 which i think was really good

586
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,179
because we me think about tor and hidden

587
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,740
services you immediately think of the

588
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,940
bad thing so you don't think about the

589
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,769
guy who wants to host some weird

590
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,169
political information or anything like

591
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:18,029
that right and these people don't have a

592
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,679
place to do it normally they have to do

593
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,289
it in their own house which as we can

594
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,639
see it's really hard to host your own

595
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:25,320
tor hidden service you're probably going

596
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,080
to screw it up so I thought that was

597
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,119
really interesting um I don't know how

598
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,379
we going for time because I don't have a

599
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:32,999
timer but I'll briefly go over the

600
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:35,399
architecture so this was once again a

601
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:38,419
residue girl raspberry pie that runs tor

602
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:40,120
a daemon

603
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,320
running on it so that you can do

604
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,940
configuration management because this

605
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,350
was literally hosting where you go to

606
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,880
our website and click I want a virtual

607
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,340
machine and it would give you one each

608
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,130
VM has its own VLAN there's a VLAN for

609
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,620
the management VM and hypervisor and

610
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,960
this transparent IP tables so the

611
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,370
virtual machines don't even know they're

612
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,110
going over tour they just seemed a

613
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,090
normal internet pack it out and it goes

614
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,010
rattle up a tour this means there's no

615
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,470
way to break out of that unless you had

616
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,790
like a Linux TCP remote or something it

617
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,560
would be insanely hard even if you broke

618
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,050
the entire hypervisor if you escaped

619
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,850
from the virtual machine you still

620
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,290
wouldn't have enough to get out onto the

621
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,940
public Internet right which is the

622
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:22,360
number one thing you want to stop so I

623
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,980
think the architecture is like really

624
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,660
good for that there was a hardening to

625
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,840
based which not so good anymore because

626
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,880
of the there's a little bit of drama

627
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,670
about that and Linux not so good anymore

628
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:35,260
but maybe you could rebuild it and be a

629
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,000
steal or something but for me it worked

630
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,240
really well at least so that is pretty

631
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,130
much it I don't know how we going for

632
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,580
time but maybe where's time of questions

633
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,379
three minutes so maybe a question or two

634
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,609
[Music]

635
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,009
and hopefully analysis but I told the

636
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:53,820
baby anyway

637
00:25:55,739 --> 00:25:59,060
well that's it sweetie Thanks

638
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,659
[Applause]
