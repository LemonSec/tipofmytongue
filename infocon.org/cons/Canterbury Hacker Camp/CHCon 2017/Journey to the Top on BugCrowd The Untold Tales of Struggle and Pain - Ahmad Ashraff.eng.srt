Chris just corn thank you for that

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,609

don't ask me wasn't the meaning of

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,800
operate Pierce I was a chemical

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,930
engineering student I would be extra

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,369
chemical engineer and then found that

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,980
chemical is not something that suits me

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,219

64
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,300
doing bounty my first of all T my first

65
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,790

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,780
500 so I did a simple question

74
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,780
on that day one a success that I found

75
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,900
in pepper box I work hard for money I

76
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,930
paid 50 that means that one exercise in

77
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,150
pepper is worth more than half of my

78
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,380
monthly paid so it's really first so it

79
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,709
since that day into the 13 I focus the

80
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,160
whole year in pepper a summer program

81
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,579
it's totally worth it just in a year I

82
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:10,019
may have to settle all my loans

83
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,709
I wish to set up or my credit cards I

84
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,728
don't have any balance instead I even

85
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:21,029
can bought a used car by cash yesterday

86
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,979
for great power does not include my

87
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:23,830
other body form

88
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,699
Google Facebook and other stuff so

89
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,930
actually do have me at the beach and

90
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,080
I've heard that there is no money

91
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,250
because after year of join bounty I ever

92
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,409
to know other people from the industry

93
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:44,349
for around the globe and modulation

94
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,419
sharing being shared among from the

95
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,810
secret agent from Google Facebook and

96
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,639
doing the most don't know before and at

97
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,210
the same time from bhavati my profile

98
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,190
becoming better and these people know me

99
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:11,229
something and they still know more about

100
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:14,530
and know not only those that possibly

101
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,750
actually absolutely yes but there are

102
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,870
some other guys that express but they

103
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,340
don't want to maybe one is not something

104
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,069
that they want so in 2013 there's a

105
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,949
start-up limbic crap because my name's

106
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:38,110
available in most pages in Internet they

107
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,150
choose me as one of the best I join and

108
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,699
participate in quite an expert one is

109
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:54,190
something like that like prophetess we

110
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:01,089
across sauce on your Versailles but we

111
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:06,610
are minimal budget so in turn 13 lucky

112
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,069
enough I'm able to get into second place

113
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:16,409
among researchers and today most of this

114
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,889
bastard I work in a good company such as

115
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:25,150
big quad currently worked with Tesla so

116
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,610
he's driving all the cool automated

117
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,979
staff doing and just briefly work with

118
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,259
45 it's currently what we background as

119
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,850
a hate on trust critiques

120
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,680
he's always traveling around Byzantine

121
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,410
bhavanti as well and me yes our doing

122
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,450
host review on the winners cooperation

123
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,590
not bad

124
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,320
okay so news just joined perform more

125
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,850
talents can be seen you can see that on

126
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,820
2015 a little assisting estimate managed

127
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,090
to maintain on top three but into a 16

128
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,300
and after ADA because interesting I

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,240
joined a banking sector banking if you

130
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,340
joined making I'm not sure how it be in

131
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,030
usually but in my country that mean you

132
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,620
don't want your life anymore there's no

133
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,880
liability so I joined that just I

134
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,600
believe in two months any programs with

135
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,120
the backdrop I fall into a number six

136
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,330
just like that so the Chile is fast so

137
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,180
back into seven luckily after join our I

138
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,760
have some three times and we need to get

139
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,430
back on second place this year so I see

140
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,390
that the first place s he's from -

141
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,370
it's a wizard you can see how he's the

142
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,490
difference of our point is he always get

143
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,550
a lot of free macaws if she stopped and

144
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,450
is short he's from UK to full time he

145
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,880
doing body as a full-time job and that's

146
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,960
a privacy and much it just means

147
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,850
actually no more human being

148
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,420
compared to others so in Barker there

149
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,370
are two programs public in private

150
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,890
public means you can register and the

151
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,680
programs the available you can just do a

152
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,650
scan your testing on it what private you

153
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:20,770
need to be in the program you need to

154
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,810
show that you are actually in which area

155
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,270
and you need to be invited

156
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,490
not all our for them and all the

157
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,970
researchers the rich can be invited into

158
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,890
program so to program offers more reward

159
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,360
and that's why most of Brazil should

160
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,340
always target target to get a body but

161
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,000
at the time only their their problems

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,440
now this but what the I found that since

163
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,930
to entity after four years

164
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,980
in Monty it's not easy I said before the

165
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,260
first thing is you need to have all the

166
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,839
equipment's to be ready on the time of

167
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,870
the brand but but won't you started you

168
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,140
need a lab at least all the mobile

169
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,120
devices all the machines all the

170
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,600
monitors and and the most important is

171
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,640
no kids doing please don't bring your

172
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,279
kids inside the lab so because whenever

173
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,020
I bring my kids I can not able to do

174
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,600
anybody at all

175
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,490
so regularly you will be not given any

176
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,310
hints what kind of about the program

177
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,790
you'll be invited so once it started the

178
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,950
program launched you Sonny

179
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,860
we ask you hey you need a pole wash so

180
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,170
way I want to find a project at the time

181
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,500
so that's why not all people able to

182
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,720
participate in program time

183
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,570
secondly you need to be fast to find all

184
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,810
the box notice it's really competitions

185
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,940
even though they say that 50 researchers

186
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,790
been invited for this program but that

187
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,680
56 actually only based on the login we

188
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,630
don't know how many use how many person

189
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,430
actually login with using one users a

190
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,570
town so there's an example you can see

191
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,550
there I've been this the program is

192
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,240
better is around 16 UTC time in 55

193
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,760
minutes operator being covered stop

194
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,550
prosecuting 30 minutes in 55 million in

195
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,910
LS 1 hours all the often be avoided so

196
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,459
it's hard for you to get to find all the

197
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,410
bus to write the report and then stymie

198
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,339
especially if you are in in a third way

199
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:41,079
the internet really slow but not most

200
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:44,050
parents that you cease time zones so for

201
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,200
those that in the zone will be where the

202
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,550
progress that they are you doing for

203
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,070
this record

204
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,880
why me yeah it's de sleeping sometime

205
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,570
I'd work at class i doing host review

206
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,190
from the

207
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,009
so there's no timing this one that I

208
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,990
used my spray spinister to create

209
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,839
mythology for me as a bounty strictly on

210
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,870
bounty about to know my free times and I

211
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,430
use only and there's no mediation or

212
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,500
actually just some little bear sitter

213
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,720
you so you can see the difference here

214
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,990
by using my maturity about how how many

215
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,230
reporters were able to file the first

216
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,600
tips is you need to focus on the less

217
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,540
participant program you need to choose

218
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,189
the one that you are strong or have

219
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:43,079
knowledge they say you are a strong in

220
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,660
mobilization don't focus on the Android

221
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,019
platform try to focus on Windows OS

222
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:52,110
because to buy a life device is really

223
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,680
expensive so not all people have this

224
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,649
your competitors so are you expecting

225
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:03,959
the packing and hardware so just focus

226
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,300
on that because not many people know

227
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,230
many this is just actually have for me I

228
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,439
focus on where change is most targeted

229
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:20,279
programs I prefer to do where because so

230
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,759
how I try I can have what and less

231
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,980
participant the first one is reverse

232
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,500
recon and also why I guess this too I

233
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,240
want to explain on that slice is try to

234
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,089
join in all or no real programs because

235
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,699
for all program usually people think

236
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,769
that all the bus all recovered but

237
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:41,579
that's a mistake

238
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:45,329
jelly 400k they're probably some contain

239
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:50,000
good changes day by day so if we

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,079
frequently check on the OP again

241
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,699
sometime maybe some other some other

242
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,579
features being newly be developer

243
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,879
develop so you can test anything

244
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,120
botanist that is complex setup for

245
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,009
opportunity requires you to buy a

246
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:07,680
premium account you need to have MS

247
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,250
account

248
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,410
try to join that because no all

249
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,560
residuals

250
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,360
willing to spend your money to buy all

251
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,090
this stuff so that's how I usually focus

252
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,570
on the reverse recount is that whenever

253
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,820
the program's asks you to test on the

254
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,110
production side

255
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,630
don't focus do a recon on the Upper East

256
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,040
Side but try to reverse think annoyed

257
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,670
find a do a recount you're taking sides

258
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,000
yeah ah um environment or the history

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,230
and doing Wayback Machine archive if

260
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,170
they are using the u.s. dating website

261
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,240
try to focus on the projects inside

262
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,960
because they usually is newly created so

263
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,570
there will be not many history in the

264
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,550
Google search or any search query engine

265
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,070
if the program provide forget this way

266
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,710
you need to combine your manual skills

267
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,680
we automated tool as well so they say

268
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,470
that you the program program ask you to

269
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,589
just hole up your website you can do it

270
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,300
after master skinning and also it's time

271
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,330
doing minerals minerals test you can do

272
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,720
this back-to-back and save all the

273
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,960
findings that you found and then try

274
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,300
again on a domain or you know in other

275
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,520
countries where sites so one of the day

276
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,450
I use is cotton being developed by a

277
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,610
major recent you can discovery discovery

278
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,950
using those sites and you can check on

279
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,900
the music on we got DNS setup where you

280
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,850
can take over then you can do a scan on

281
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,370
skin pots kind on the common white pops

282
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,800
what else I do yes

283
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,830
what a coordinator is actually he going

284
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,070
to check on the discover and do a

285
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,089
screenshot here this one up the

286
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:12,100
continuation you can see that I do agree

287
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,300
you can find all and and then you can

288
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,150
check on the Commonwealth available once

289
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,570
it's done that you do I get three and

290
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,220
get all the basic information such as

291
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,040
headers and do a screenshot so from here

292
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,780
you'll be provided with summary of type

293
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,670
of same as in use let's say you have a

294
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,430
zero day in what price it was try or

295
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,620
everything you know to say hey this such

296
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,300
utilize this F as on most of the

297
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:44,520
production sites so this way you saw and

298
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,329
put in together say in the intruder and

299
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:55,500
do our skin if discovered just semitic

300
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,640
money yet the second tip is using the

301
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,030
drift metric use proper avrt Cross

302
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,860
volunteer rating doesn't mean something

303
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,540
like CBS s they provide for a series

304
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,110
doing that what kind of about they want

305
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,370
so here example of a critical high and

306
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,320
also medium usually recession most of

307
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,110
researchers focus and the cool but such

308
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,750
as cross excreting suicide Richter

309
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,339
forgery was asked all the time because

310
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,520
cool bus if you cool stories to write in

311
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,800
a blog post so who wants to know about

312
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,070
user in Russian that's not quick all so

313
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,620
for me I don't care about cool button

314
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,860
aku but for me I think it is you can get

315
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,200
money so I just focus on the not cool

316
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,720
not cool but in the programs so even not

317
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,290
this I still receive the same point

318
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,610
compatible cool bus there's no different

319
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,910
all I seriously this time point for

320
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:11,459
assumption is C final in page hey the

321
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,030
occupation start immediately I still see

322
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,460
the same reward doing

323
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,819
[Music]

324
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:23,310
Rufus attack so you don't need to have

325
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,369
must feel to find need to spend lots of

326
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:29,350
time to find all the cool bus you just

327
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,929
focus on the less cool bar and find some

328
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:33,160
based on the risk

329
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,710
they provided this one attack here in

330
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,160
sample that if you can see it read era

331
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,710
is obviously this probably explanation

332
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,260
of operator attack if you sum it just be

333
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,470
one but you only receive five points and

334
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,660
also hundred dollars but if you can

335
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,380
check it properly

336
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,380
that's HTTP weekly attacks they say

337
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,200
where you can try to brofist the admin

338
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,990
page admin credentials is there using

339
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,080
default rates critic issues and if you

340
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,650
able to attack and log in page there's

341
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,100
another type so if you're able to find

342
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,990
exercise on the same parameter SS all

343
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,690
right and that change we all see it all

344
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,610
together you can receive around 120

345
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,490
points it was you $4,000 instead through

346
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,940
the opera direct so here's example I

347
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,120
found operator on one of the program on

348
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,090
the written summary six months ago it's

349
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,800
a duplicate obviously before already

350
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,290
know that but two months later I try

351
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,360
again on the same parameter a there's a

352
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,670
cross-site scripting I submitted a no

353
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,470
one submitted yeah Oh

354
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,380
so I submit it and receive 300 bucks for

355
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,710
that not just me there's another process

356
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:03,220
15 or even some fine little sorry for

357
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:08,970
three through a narrator next is a

358
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,160
mobile view usually when you brush

359
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,170
oversize dead end mobile using your

360
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,210
browser you will be redirected to the

361
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,430
main page because the app it should not

362
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,560
stay you know using mobile version of

363
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,020
Rosa so why even need to do is just

364
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,860
change your user agent or also just use

365
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,690
your mobile to try to browse through the

366
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,720
website to check it is it possible to

367
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,060
access all USA because once you're able

368
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,910
to access a website usually you probably

369
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,890
a new session cookies that you can

370
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,470
utilize it for another attack

371
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,150
and there's more features and therefore

372
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,620
this input usually and using in mobile

373
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,870
application their lack of security

374
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,890
checks just one of the program that I

375
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,960
used to mobile user agent and able to

376
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,830
find able to found the administration

377
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,740
page and able to bypass it and from that

378
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,250
page but I notice that all the user

379
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,070
input inside and in stretching

380
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,710
Bondo's is vulnerable to a screen on

381
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:19,990
so from this only one program from this

382
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,990
one you're I mean to get 1k just for

383
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,990
that just using a mobile browser so

384
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,970
after the program being launched I think

385
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,100
after a week which means that no one

386
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,600
actually checked on the mobile browser

387
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,080
next one is befriend which s files just

388
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,450
by most of the fiction now this relies

389
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,450
on the GS abroad website and view this

390
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:51,220
source page in the application try to

391
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,169
use the edge a as to locate another JS

392
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:56,470
file and try to look at a path fasting

393
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,640
crawl result look at some enemy okay

394
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,400
it means any speech generation from that

395
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,299
because just relying on the your tools

396
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,730
some of this function and only can be

397
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,830
seen in the J's file will not be visible

398
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,600
yeah example Oh

399
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:27,010
so that essentially you can see that in

400
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:36,909
the password who actually put in and

401
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:41,190
also definite target read usually

402
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,049
contain a path they actually I'm not

403
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,580
able to discover through my tools

404
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,890
so I revealed through the GS and do

405
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,520
analyze and this partially vanuatu SQL

406
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,650
so quietly totally what to view injector

407
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,500
you need to properly line-by-line

408
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,010
checking not to be me not to miss any of

409
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:10,450
the what and this is another one day way

410
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,860
upon this one-sided redirect you to a

411
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,440
mean side but I found it contain a lot

412
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,690
in yes if I brought there is to that law

413
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,270
English as you direct me to not tries to

414
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,560
view this special which means it

415
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,770
presented me we're interface it means

416
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,180
but good checksum session restricted so

417
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,090
from this is actually found this analogy

418
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,950
it's fine sorry I do something like that

419
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,080
able to find another path and using a

420
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,750
part able to bypass the image to fish

421
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,840
and also able to join able to assess the

422
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,630
enemy structure new features about some

423
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,330
way about some bad also on still and

424
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,170
then I receive some cool reverse that

425
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,660
and this let's see some of the programs

426
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,610
usually provide you with a lot of issues

427
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,860
they don't want to see any SSA they

428
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,750
don't want to see any Opera in the

429
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,340
submission they don't want to see they

430
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,830
don't want see if this happen if this

431
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,950
point invites you to do literacy on your

432
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,870
side for me I don't do I don't

433
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,820
participate it's wasting much time so

434
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,310
I'm nothing to do here so I just focus

435
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:25,510
on the program so I think that's it this

436
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:33,550
list of tools that I use I use but it's

437
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,760
a must do in passing some reconnaissance

438
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,310
accordance by the food animal sister is

439
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,560
really good in discovering all the

440
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,280
subdomains

441
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,690
scanning tooth is more on the same as

442
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:52,780
skinny double scallops can expel me for

443
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,269
a square solution

444
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,479
was an elf as a sea attack and also did

445
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,219
is possible the one issue I just don't

446
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:00,869
befriend with yes puzzle

447
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:03,809
yes fault so there are two there's some

448
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,149
but hunters they actually crazier Ong as

449
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:09,269
possible such as shown and band they

450
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:11,700
create as well if you find a J's file

451
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,459
and just put that your into this tool

452
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:16,799
and they're going to crawl is there any

453
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,169
other your added be not not being

454
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:22,589
covered through your - through your skin

455
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:27,539
tools so I think that's it is really

456
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:33,239
fast minutes and then just get whatever

457
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:36,179
40 minutes so it's the any question

458
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:50,839
about the mythology I said auntie yeah

459
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:56,789
yeah I mean come on

460
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:03,149
oh it's just that as you see I'm doing

461
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:05,099
this for part time I don't have much

462
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,079
time to focus on other programs so I

463
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,919
just focus on backrub because for me

464
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,519
they provide with a greater reward

465
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,479
compared to backdrop but in terms of

466
00:25:17,479 --> 00:25:20,820
participant completeness Baca has less

467
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,729
completed compare the hacker one so for

468
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:27,079
patent bounty hunter like me it's

469
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:29,429
referred to focus on program that have

470
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:31,829
less computers so that's why it's still

471
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:34,729
still a crowd

472
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:45,799
so internet web officially means that

473
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:52,429
you want to see any path or all files

474
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:54,230
that actually been used before

475
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:57,260
in the application but if you try to

476
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,360
find through Google's it's not available

477
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,850
so sometimes it's more like history of

478
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,320
the websites so you can see some js5

479
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,929
that usually being used before but not

480
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:11,390
being removed by developer Italy give

481
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,580
you some of the old function T of the

482
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,340
affliction something is super adorable

483
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,340
yeah

484
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:35,180
is it in terms of reward or the coolest

485
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:39,100
I think the coolest one I found was

486
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,990
there are two actually as graduation one

487
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:45,080
of in pepper the second one is one in

488
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,450
the program in bakra in purpose that

489
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,360
there's a question with a question

490
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:58,820
company of pepper named Bill if so the

491
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,090
ability is a search form normal form

492
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,080
that usually found its Khan

493
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,640
obviously there's there was a process

494
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,610
scripting it's a duplicate but I noticed

495
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:15,110
that from that same such such

496
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,010
financially is there's a limited-edition

497
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,600
Monte it's just that you don't you

498
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,240
cannot decide using a single quote you

499
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,370
need to use double quotes so know there

500
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,230
are multiple user actually already test

501
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:35,050
on the same form same base but no no no

502
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,360
no just me that notice that you just

503
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,880
made a wider picture to interact

504
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,520
differently and probably and the thing

505
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,940
is for you to submit that to the PayPal

506
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,290
you need to provide a proper POC so I

507
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:58,490
just use a base see we are doing SQL

508
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,270
three such as I use a double quote or

509
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:06,410
some table name equals equal percentage

510
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:12,020
some some name that unity I put it in my

511
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,020
blog post you can read it so it's

512
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,170
interesting because that similar form

513
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,420
the search function form being tested by

514
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,150
multiple guys by lots of user I just

515
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,210
joined a funny why no one actually tried

516
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,490
to test this manually so it's that's

517
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:33,800
something that I find amusing because

518
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,290
probably some of the guy just think that

519
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,870
a search for Ashley only with

520
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,700
to process 15 just not and other

521
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,580
attached the second is a in a private

522
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,930
program in what crowd way this a

523
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,090
explanation that you cannot use you need

524
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:55,130
to use it's really really you can check

525
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,790
its really well it's only my squad the

526
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,250
database using Microsoft Express over so

527
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,390
it's a blind type of attack you can use

528
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,340
common blind attacks such as pine bass

529
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:16,550
or you need to use D in yes I know sure

530
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:19,070
what we call it such as language you can

531
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,260
say language because one is English

532
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,050
language equal to is probably not lying

533
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,920
some of that so you need to use the

534
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,090
compressor and the boolean conversion

535
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,890
using if name equal is language greater

536
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:39,020
than is greater than limit password

537
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,530
summer day so actually from the curry it

538
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,900
only the picture only check on the value

539
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,540
that I should say on server so if the

540
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,610
really of language is one is with me

541
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:52,460
English and they valued except for that

542
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,280
trade is 13 it will send if your error

543
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:05,530
page if you change so that's how I can

544
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,010
blind a bank some sort of financial

545
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,220
special program able to get the highest

546
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,890
amount because it give me it took me

547
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,690
around five years to do recession that

548
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,900
able to get a proper piece here I put in

549
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,210
my posters but that's a cool

550
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,510
and from engineering University so I

551
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,330
took chemical engineering because one of

552
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,980
the reason I don't have any money to

553
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,680
attend other stuff so this agency

554
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,280
provide me with some solid scholarships

555
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,520
so I just took it because I don't have

556
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,610
any mission in my dream I seen you I see

557
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:13,610
young just go with the flow and learn

558
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,340
all those chemical how to create waters

559
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:22,490
on on my yeah one of the seniors asked

560
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,550
me to join him to follow him on night

561
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,050
280 lat

562
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,510
I thought what the hell is going to do

563
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,180
so actually he's hiking to let machines

564
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:38,110
I said wow yeah because in my industry

565
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,390
for you to open Google page to around 30

566
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,880
minutes it's really soft internet this

567
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,720
is so by doing that the seniors able to

568
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,580
play some solitaire verse proceeded and

569
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,670
from the room able to get a high-speed

570
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,950
Internet so from it is something

571
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,220
interesting and it's quite badly because

572
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,390
because of him one of my subject I feel

573
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,340
one of massager because I don't go to

574
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:09,490
the s/m I focus on doing hiking so yeah

575
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,950
after I graduate I found that campaign

576
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,680
is not something that I like I want to

577
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,350
do something that I have passion so this

578
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:21,770
why do luckily one another city that

579
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,520
actually work away a consulting firm say

580
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,040
hey there's a junior road available do

581
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,880
you want to try yeah I'll try it so but

582
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,000
Jenny I teach kriti in my country with

583
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,680
that kind of backgrounds not really good

584
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,990
for you because that's where most other

585
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,880
companies try to take advantage of your

586
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,970
skill god you have a skill but you have

587
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,690
no better IT no money for you

588
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,179
yeah yes I start doing about what the

589
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:51,489
boost my profile I say I'm good actually

590
00:32:51,489 --> 00:33:01,840
so one buck the maximum I did from

591
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,149
pepper 7500 the escalation that I just

592
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:10,779
know yeah yes but they are the person

593
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:13,899
they're able to get 50 50 K or about 20k

594
00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:16,239
for he : yeah if you tell me not try to

595
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:20,399
Jericho on it's really worth it yeah

596
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,519
ratio ratio

597
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,229
it depends sometimes let's say I know

598
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:45,979
that the program did the crime that I

599
00:33:45,979 --> 00:33:48,529
joined I joined live on the program and

600
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:52,369
that's a program contain a lot lots of

601
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:54,289
broken features I know that they

602
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:56,570
actually already been covered so I tried

603
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:01,249
to focus on something that's not common

604
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:03,469
something that probably required to do

605
00:34:03,469 --> 00:34:08,480
change stars on so now this my duplicate

606
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,069
ratio compact before recep over ten

607
00:34:13,069 --> 00:34:16,690
maybe two or three
