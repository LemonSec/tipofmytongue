1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,470
so my name is Alex and I work in on the

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,779
blue team adolescent and for some reason

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:08,580
they accepted me to do a talk here so

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,179
here I am recently like last year some

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,710
people wrote about me and they referred

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,120
to me as a hacker who goes by the name

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,210
Alex I get in quotes and that's my

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,080
that's my real name

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,439
and so so that this is my hacker handle

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,840
now and um I'm just gonna pretend that

11
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,820
I'm ok with it

12
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,140
so before we start some of you might be

13
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,060
having the genius idea to hack your

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,590
friends because this talk is about me

15
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,079
hacking my friend how about you don't do

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,910
that because they're your friends and

17
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,309
also because just don't attack people

18
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,480
sorry about the screen flickering this

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,129
HDMI cable is held together with nothing

20
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,770
but man's hubris so it could be a bit

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,219
wild ok so this is my friend Diana

22
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:48,570
except Diana is not her real name that's

23
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,070
not her real picture and I'm actually a

24
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,480
bunch of Arduino in a trench coat so

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,730
nothing is real she gave me permission

26
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,320
to do this thing

27
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,640
she gave me permission to hack all of

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,260
their stuff and she understands what

29
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,739
that means so let's talk about Danna

30
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:02,789
briefly so you can get to know this

31
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,049
person we're about to get to know a lot

32
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,090
more and she's the comedian that's what

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,140
she does she's a comedian flash

34
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,060
performer slash something something like

35
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,640
that so I work and she's young she's

36
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,340
like early 20s and she's like not

37
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,720
particularly tech literate she doesn't

38
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,280
do tech for a job she's as tech literate

39
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,580
as everyone else that age so here's the

40
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,810
rules here's what we talked about I went

41
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,009
met up with her and said can i hack all

42
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:24,240
your stuff and she was like yeah she was

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,369
like really keen and she was like you

44
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,420
sure what she was like yeah

45
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,460
and so she I've got 12 months to do it

46
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,079
and it's at best out of this end of last

47
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,270
year I'm not allowed to delete anything

48
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,890
she has no dad to delete her emails or

49
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,479
anything she has to be just like I

50
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,220
wasn't there and I'm not allowed to

51
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,799
disrupt her daily life so this means

52
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,439
that like I couldn't for example reset

53
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,729
her email password and change it to a

54
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,560
password I just no because then she

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,000
won't be able to get into email and she

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,320
needs to be able to get into a email so

57
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,759
I'm not allowed to like interrupt her

58
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,530
doing stuff those are the rules I told

59
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,600
her about also I made up two more and

60
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,860
I've decided that I want to do it

61
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,090
without getting caught I don't want her

62
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,560
to know that I'm doing it until I want

63
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,909
her to know so I don't want her to just

64
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:00,930
accidentally find me

65
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,420
and also I'm her friend and so ACK and

66
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,740
we're friends on Facebook and stuff and

67
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,600
I like could arrange a meeting with her

68
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,740
in person and stuff and I don't want to

69
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,360
be is that I want to do it for real like

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,250
I'm a real hacker this is my first time

71
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,540
doing anything like this so this is just

72
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,860
me this talk is me

73
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,350
being furiously so I get ready for that

74
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,550
here we go I'm about to do it you're

75
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,110
gonna see all the mistakes I made all

76
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,600
the good stuff I did some of that let's

77
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,940
just do it so the first thing I want to

78
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,320
know is what's the email address and

79
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,820
like this is might be in my email

80
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,380
contacts I don't know but I just I'm

81
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,670
gonna try and get a village it way and

82
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,590
from watching other conference talks and

83
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,390
you know seeing like red teams and stuff

84
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm pretty sure the legit way that you

85
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,180
find stuff is just by typing in people's

86
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,040
names and stuff and go into LinkedIn I'm

87
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,680
pretty sure this is hacking and so I did

88
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,850
this I said I typed in her name in

89
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,290
LinkedIn and what did I find on her

90
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,090
LinkedIn page hey mail address it's just

91
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,040
there people just put their people just

92
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,240
put that information on LinkedIn because

93
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,040
Lincoln says put your email here and

94
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,230
they go alright so I did I found an

95
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,110
email address step one done I see your

96
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,760
email address I'm like great wait wait

97
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,700
is that a hotmail email address what and

98
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,989
I'm like maybe that's not her main email

99
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:01,980
address maybe that's just the one for

100
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,900
LinkedIn and so I go to her Twitter and

101
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,520
I try and reset a Twitter password and

102
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,390
when you try and reset someone's

103
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,670
password Twitter will tell you like hey

104
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,840
this is the email address that we're

105
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,430
gonna send the password reset email to

106
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,989
but only show you some of the characters

107
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,150
but this matched the one that I found on

108
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,950
LinkedIn so now I'm like okay no this is

109
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,900
really someone who uses hotmail in 2017

110
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,750
let's go and so now when I get a phone

111
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,980
number and so how do I get a friend

112
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,720
number well I'm using this advanced

113
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,280
hacking technique I saw mr. robot where

114
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,930
you like type someone's you type of

115
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,459
stuff into Google and so I put an email

116
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,930
and her friend and the word phone and

117
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,760
then the some university paid from her

118
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,019
university that says hey you want to

119
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,269
sign up to my club sure contact me at

120
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,440
this email address or this phone number

121
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,049
so that's what happens if you put your

122
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,280
stuff on the public Internet I guess

123
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,019
people like me find it one of these like

124
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:43,410
me

125
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,480
okay so done email just phone number

126
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,049
yeah email doesn't phone number so um I

127
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,630
saw apparently all the advanced hackers

128
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,519
at Def Con use this lead exploit kit

129
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,140
called Google Docs to store all this

130
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,640
stuff and so I pasted all this stuff

131
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,989
into a Google Doc because that's what

132
00:03:57,989 --> 00:03:59,430
you supposed to do maybe any later and

133
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,470
so now that I've got this weapons-grade

134
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,820
Google Doc all the stuff that I found

135
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,620
what am I gonna do with it what am I

136
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,720
going to have to do hacking now and I'm

137
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,340
like maybe I should do this trick where

138
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,079
you just email some would like you send

139
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,760
somebody a Word document and it's got a

140
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,350
macro in it and they click it and it

141
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,579
runs the macro and now you have a shell

142
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,529
on the computer but I'm like well that's

143
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,180
pretty boring I'd like everyone does

144
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,019
doing that I want to do something

145
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,089
different and also I'm kind of worried

146
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,048
that maybe she doesn't actually use

147
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:24,180
Microsoft Word like does anyone here not

148
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,380
have Microsoft Word at all does anyone

149
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,310
does not have it

150
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,900
don't have it yeah everyone well I mean

151
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,950
this is the hacking conference but all

152
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,530
right and so I'm kind of worried that

153
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,550
she doesn't use it at all and I don't

154
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,870
want to like myself and get caught and

155
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,639
so I'm like well I want to do that

156
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,990
so actually what I'm gonna try and do is

157
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,010
I'm gonna try and get into this email

158
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,690
account and by this point it's a few

159
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,440
months have passed and I've forgotten

160
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,760
about all the rules that I said and the

161
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,990
many ways and we just would violate it

162
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,160
but I do it anyway because it's my first

163
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,260
day and so now I'm gonna try and get her

164
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,330
email password so we're gonna try and

165
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,770
log into her email because then because

166
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,150
I figured like she's gonna be keeping

167
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,530
everything in the cloud so logging into

168
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,120
the email will be like that'll be like

169
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,470
her life that'll be like the keys to the

170
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,690
kingdom it's what I think foolishly and

171
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,300
so I go to this website this is a great

172
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,550
website I said have I been poned calm

173
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,020
and you can type in your email address

174
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,550
and it will tell you if you've appeared

175
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,470
in any like data leaks from companies

176
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,070
that got hacked

177
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,110
for example LinkedIn got hacked in 2012

178
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,210
and this site will tell you was your

179
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,040
email address in the hack of LinkedIn

180
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,720
emails and password hashes that got out

181
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,220
and nowhere does it say you have to put

182
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,810
in your email address so I just for him

183
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,240
her email address got him I did it

184
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,139
hacking and so this is what it showed up

185
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:26,550
it said she was in patreon and Tumblr

186
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,100
and patreon that's a patreon okay she

187
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,210
was in there and a bunch of stuff got

188
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,280
taken with us any passwords and so the

189
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,200
tumblr dump the tumblr hack it says okay

190
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,550
there were emails and passwords in there

191
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,229
so like aha passwords that's what I want

192
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,080
and so I just happen to have the tumblr

193
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,380
leak from 2013 just lying around and so

194
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,120
here's what looks like it's just one

195
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,590
long file and it's got emails and

196
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,450
passwords but the passwords are hashed

197
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,100
and I will stare out on the internet and

198
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,690
no one really knows no one's got a

199
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,280
strong consensus on what these hashes

200
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
are some people have some theories and

201
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,240
stuff but no one's no one's like super

202
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,639
confident on it it's what I thought and

203
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,229
so then okay did some more research and

204
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,330
people seem to think it's sha-1 and they

205
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,889
have a static soul and so what is

206
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,000
actually that mean was the static so

207
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,169
what are those words mean well I'm gonna

208
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:08,820
tell you now because I'm not I want to

209
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,979
be and so imagine that you're storing

210
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,300
your passwords in plain text this is

211
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,490
what it looks like yeah the user and you

212
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,919
have their password and that's that

213
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,669
you're doing it you're storing the

214
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,139
passwords when they type when they type

215
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,280
in the password you've got it so you can

216
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,110
check no worries easy but know people

217
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,340
don't actually do that because they're

218
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,770
very security conscious and so actually

219
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:27,210
they store the hash of the password and

220
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,680
so hashing a password turns into a

221
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,450
really big number and it's supposed to

222
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,100
be difficult to turn the hash back into

223
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,409
the password and so okay now imagine

224
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:35,880
that we store the password hashes it

225
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,440
looks like this okay there we go

226
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,110
everyone's got a password hash

227
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,870
your password but I've read on some

228
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,220
security website is supposed to salt the

229
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,290
password hashes and say ok so salting is

230
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,150
where you don't just hash the password

231
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,040
and store that you hash the password and

232
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,570
then you stick a little random string on

233
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,800
the end or at the beginning it doesn't

234
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,180
matter and then you stick this random

235
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,410
string on the end in case someone

236
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,820
happens to have a big list of hashes and

237
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,290
what they have to in case somebody's

238
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,510
precomputed the hashes of a whole bunch

239
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,010
of common strings and they want to use

240
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,780
that knowledge to try and crack the

241
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,580
hashes here in case they steal your

242
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,740
password database but I'm gonna cleverly

243
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,940
thought them by putting this random

244
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,650
string on the end so now they're pre

245
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,180
computed a list won't work there's some

246
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,970
other reason for that's anyone and so ok

247
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,800
I've read that I should put one I should

248
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,880
read the I should to take a salt on the

249
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
end and the good folks at tumblr did

250
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,560
this in 2013 because it was 2013 was a

251
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,230
different time and so now all the

252
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,360
passwords have the same little string on

253
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,610
the end and so you'll notice that these

254
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,990
two people these two users happen to

255
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,580
have the same password and so because

256
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,840
they have the same password and the same

257
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,580
salt the thing that's gonna get hashed

258
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,830
is exactly the same and so in this case

259
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,620
having the same password only happens if

260
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,910
you have the same hash if you have the

261
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,000
same hash you have the same password so

262
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,930
that means if two people had the same

263
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,100
password that have the same password

264
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,170
hash so in this case even though they're

265
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,790
statically salted these two users have

266
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,580
the same password hash because they have

267
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,230
the same actual password as well and so

268
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,280
why am i telling all this what does it

269
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,560
have to do with my friend well when I

270
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,360
had when I found this tumbler dump just

271
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,790
lying around in my pocket I have the

272
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,290
first thing I did was search for my

273
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,880
friend's email address and so Danny's

274
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,110
email address yes it was in there and

275
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,610
there's a hash and I tried to crack the

276
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,470
hash but I didn't know what salt tumbler

277
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,420
used people know as a static so I don't

278
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,530
know what it is it's not that random

279
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,580
thing I had that were just an example

280
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,200
and to this day I still don't know it so

281
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,850
if you know please tell me

282
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,730
and so I I tried to crack the hash do

283
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,780
you know the traditional ways but it

284
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,250
didn't work probably because I didn't

285
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,680
know and so I was like well can I still

286
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,680
get her passwords on how and so what I

287
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,370
did was I gripped the the tumbler

288
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,130
password dump thing not for Danny's

289
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,840
email address but for her password hash

290
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,049
and so obviously when I do this like

291
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:39,919
what do you think's gonna come up

292
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,229
obviously Dan is like a damaged thing is

293
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:43,400
gonna come off her email in her password

294
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,110
that's correct but also like a whole

295
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,810
bunch of other ones came up and so this

296
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,000
means that there's approximately 20

297
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,070
people weren't exactly 20 who had the

298
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,390
same password hashes

299
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,100
and so because it's a static so because

300
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,360
they have the same hash that means it

301
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,980
had the same password as Diana and I

302
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,420
still don't know what it is but I know

303
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,070
it's the same and because there's 20 of

304
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,240
them I'm guessing it's not a

305
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,680
particularly good password because they

306
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,930
all have the same one okay so don't know

307
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,450
her password but also yes if the people

308
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,650
have the same time with password and

309
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,970
I've seen these sides before I swear

310
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,890
also do you know that LinkedIn was Act

311
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,250
in 2012 they were and they had the same

312
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,300
thing they hashed their passwords I

313
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,470
don't think they were soldered I think

314
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,390
it was shy one and probably as a result

315
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,160
of that did you know that almost all the

316
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,410
LinkedIn passwords the hashes have been

317
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,730
cracked and they just they're just in

318
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,720
plain text and you can just download

319
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,970
them when the internet I didn't know

320
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,880
that but then I found out and so what

321
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,310
this means is that those people that had

322
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,990
the same password as Diana in the tumblr

323
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,170
dump maybe there those people have their

324
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:40,400
passwords exposed in LinkedIn dumped

325
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,930
Diana wasn't in the LinkedIn one she

326
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,940
didn't have LinkedIn then but maybe

327
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,290
these people did and so I looked up

328
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,970
those people's email addresses not the

329
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,200
hashes just say email addresses in the

330
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,910
LinkedIn dump and most of them had the

331
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,410
same password it was this QWERTY one

332
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,170
thing and so I was like okay that that

333
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,640
must be what that hashes even though I

334
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,140
know what the soldiers that must be what

335
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,400
the hashes because they have the same

336
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,140
password on LinkedIn as on tumblr and

337
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,400
with each other it's probably all the

338
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,320
same thing and so it's just quite II one

339
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,550
thing QWERTY one is what the real

340
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,910
password

341
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,500
I've got genius operational security

342
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,860
don't worry and so I go to the partner

343
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,690
logon screen and smash that qwerty one

344
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,860
button type all those things in hit

345
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,020
enter and it goes no wrong password I

346
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,670
was like well damn it why did I spend

347
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,290
all that time doing that just for this

348
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,080
well that's and so then I try and I

349
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,580
tried everything I tried Facebook as

350
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,560
well and Facebook has this feature where

351
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,910
it will tell you if the password is an

352
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,770
old one and so I said yes that was the

353
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,510
password five months ago but no you'll

354
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,740
want to be and so okay nope no dice so

355
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,120
now I'm gonna have to do something

356
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,860
different like okay fine I want to do

357
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,210
something cool and creative and we're

358
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,170
gonna have to do it the old-fashioned

359
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,089
way and so maybe this is what I should

360
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:42,650
do maybe I should just send down an

361
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,210
email that's like subject line heavy

362
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,820
breathing be like come on please click

363
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,500
this link I really need you to I think

364
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,660
this is Heidi phishing I'm not sure it's

365
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,440
a bit now I'm actually gonna do

366
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,960
something like this so here's my genius

367
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,089
master plan maybe I'm gonna send Dan a

368
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,560
fake email from Microsoft because she's

369
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,980
hot mail and it's gonna say hey click on

370
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,170
this link because I'm Microsoft and it's

371
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,910
gonna take her to a fake login page it

372
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,200
looks just like the hotmail login page

373
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,620
but it's

374
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,200
and then she'll type in her password the

375
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,720
past will go to me and then just she'll

376
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,400
get sent to the real hotmail login page

377
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,930
and she's already logged in so she'll be

378
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,430
sent to the hotmail I'm page and just be

379
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,870
like oh that was weird and hopefully

380
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,600
just leave it alone so first thing I

381
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,950
want to do is create a fake email

382
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,330
account because this email has to come

383
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,890
from Microsoft obviously it's not coming

384
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,360
from Microsoft's coming for me so I'm

385
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,680
gonna try and do this Microsoft account

386
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,810
team thing but you can't do that because

387
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,700
that email just isn't available either

388
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,170
because Microsoft actually uses it but I

389
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,130
tried a few more and I'm pretty sure

390
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,540
because it has the word Microsoft in it

391
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,710
I think you can't have the word

392
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,140
Microsoft in the name or in the email so

393
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,250
let me ask you a question do you know

394
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,130
what these are never seen these before

395
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,650
looks like two O's doesn't it but

396
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,030
actually only one is I know

397
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,500
and the other one is the Greek letter

398
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,870
Omicron which looks a lot like a No

399
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,670
but it's not the same thing it's got a

400
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,230
different unicode code point or ASCII

401
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,280
thing I've got a different it's a

402
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,560
different number and so if you were to

403
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,090
say write the word Microsoft with these

404
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,160
things it would look like that and to a

405
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,930
computer it looks like Micra and then oh

406
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,450
microns and you get the idea but to

407
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,830
human looks like the word Microsoft and

408
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,970
you might be wondering like does this

409
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,770
actually work would it actually work on

410
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,870
Microsoft like surely surely not yes I

411
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,070
know totally does work you can do that

412
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,170
and so here's the email sno it's from

413
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,240
the Microsoft account team and it's got

414
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,740
a look at that green that green check

415
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,030
mark is me how many all doesn't do that

416
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,280
in case you're wondering and so it says

417
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,990
yeah I'm gonna lift this is a really

418
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,040
generic fish because I didn't want to

419
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,810
spend too much time on it and it says

420
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,280
hey I'm gonna we're gonna lock your

421
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,780
account because it's suspicious look at

422
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,460
this IP address IP address is very

423
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,260
suspicious aren't they if you don't want

424
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,670
us to walk you can click this button and

425
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,200
we're gonna make sure that you secure

426
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,760
login I don't know whatever if you

427
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,110
listen oh yeah oh no that's not real

428
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,660
this'll probably work and so then I send

429
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,950
it to her and it says here 48 hours to

430
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,000
do this so we're gonna cause you account

431
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,070
so I sent it to her and when she clicks

432
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,030
it she's gonna go to this Buono when she

433
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,740
clicks it I need a copy of the hotmail

434
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,450
login screen this is a hotmail login

435
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,100
screen I need a copy of it and so I

436
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,150
don't know if you guys know much about

437
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,340
hacking but I looked on the internet and

438
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,780
apparently the wavy hacker on a web page

439
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,250
is here right click on it when you click

440
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,160
this inspect element button and this

441
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,530
button is the good stuff

442
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,970
and so I did that I reflect on it and I

443
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,990
did the inspect element thing and I

444
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,520
copied the whole page and copy the HTML

445
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,100
but now I have the HTML about my login

446
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,780
screen and I need to post it somewhere

447
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,660
so she can click on link and be sent to

448
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,000
and so I did this I wanted to know where

449
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,699
I can host this HTML and it turns out

450
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:26,079
there's this aerobatic website and I

451
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,980
don't know if they know but they're

452
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,790
great fishing service and so you can you

453
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,110
can ho static HTML there and it's really

454
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,880
easy you get your own subdomain you get

455
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,470
HTTP and it's not blocked by spam

456
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,420
filters or anything and also no one's

457
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,860
taken all the good subdomains so I was

458
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,449
able to get a good one

459
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:42,010
use a referral code Diana to be

460
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:45,190
immediately reported to the NSA so I

461
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,959
made this URL this is the one I

462
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,459
registered this is gonna cause the Rio

463
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:50,230
login screen is login don't live dot

464
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,779
aerobatic that I registered this one but

465
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:54,490
actually no login the no login URL

466
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,570
actually looks like that it looks like

467
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,930
this so I registered the actual URL that

468
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,220
ended up happening with this because all

469
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,269
login screens have a bunch of stuff

470
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:02,889
after the year after the slash in the

471
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:06,040
URL so I made sure to do that so it

472
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,600
looks like this looks very similar huh

473
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,820
and so on my version there's a little

474
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,170
extra something that I added which is

475
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,899
two bits of JavaScript one which when

476
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:15,519
when you click on the submit button when

477
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,019
you click on the like submit password

478
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,880
button it makes an image in the page and

479
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,040
the source of that image is a website I

480
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,709
control and the website it's my website

481
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:25,690
slash Diana and then question mark and

482
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,579
then the password and so that's not a

483
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:29,230
real URL it's gonna be a 44 it's gonna

484
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,550
be a broken image but you won't notice

485
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,410
but meanwhile in my logs will be this

486
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,350
request for this slash Diana and then a

487
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,430
password and so I'm gonna be able to

488
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,810
grab the logs and it'll just be there

489
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,910
this is some cheap and dirty like way to

490
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,380
do this I don't know why I did this

491
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,620
please understand there's also I also do

492
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,970
a thing where after she clicks login

493
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,209
button it waits one second and then

494
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:50,560
sends her to the real hotmail login page

495
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,120
the waiting one second thing is to

496
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,470
simulate an Australian internet speeds

497
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,910
if you don't live in Australia don't

498
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,160
worry about it you can do like ten you

499
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,750
can you can do like a tenth of a second

500
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,110
or something

501
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,540
and so I send this to her and wait 24

502
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,550
hours but she doesn't click on it so

503
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,010
then but I said I gave her 48 hours so

504
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,209
then wait 48 hours and she still doesn't

505
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,569
click on it and that's it that's that's

506
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,579
the that's all that inspect element for

507
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:12,959
nothing

508
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,170
and so I'm like okay just give up but no

509
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,209
I haven't given up yet so this time I'm

510
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,279
gonna do a slightly more last time the

511
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,779
problem was the fish was too generic it

512
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,220
was like hey I'm from Microsoft is

513
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,540
anyone open automated emails for

514
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,649
Microsoft apparently not

515
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:28,839
and so actually this time I'm gonna do a

516
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,100
different fish and I neat for this I'm

517
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,110
gonna need Google Docs but she isn't

518
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,790
this is a hotmail account so maybe

519
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,620
she doesn't maybe she it'll be weird for

520
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,180
hotmail to link you to Google Docs sound

521
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,440
like alright let's make is there such

522
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,730
thing as Microsoft Google Docs and yes

523
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,500
siree that's cold one cloud SkyDrive

524
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,060
something something something but Israel

525
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:45,220
and you can you can host documents

526
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,050
they're actually tried to I did this and

527
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,250
then for this talk I tried to find it

528
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,730
again I couldn't find it I guess what's

529
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,630
gonna happen she's gonna be on the

530
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,950
internet she's gonna get an email from a

531
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,240
recruiter it's not gonna be a recruit

532
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,190
it's gonna be me and it's gonna take it

533
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,410
to the same fake login page and then

534
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,390
she's gonna password and then instead of

535
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,830
taking it to the hotmail login page it's

536
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,360
gonna take it to this fake Google Doc

537
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,460
Microsoft Google Doc thing that I made

538
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,810
and the Google Doc is gonna be erasing

539
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,110
me

540
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,370
that's why that's why that's a recruiter

541
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,840
that's why I needed a dog thing it's

542
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,970
very resume and then she's gonna go back

543
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,230
to what she's doing and not suspect a

544
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,410
thing

545
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,840
I hope okay but so we need a fake person

546
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,830
for this I mean this fake recruiter

547
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,240
can't send it from Alex that's not gonna

548
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,790
work so I go to the Google okay I get it

549
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,920
go to they create Google login create

550
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,930
Google account page thing here's the

551
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:27,130
thing about this first name last name

552
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,540
email address boxes you can put anything

553
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,040
you want in here like you don't have to

554
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,870
put your real name I've felt a bit wild

555
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,950
putting in not my real name

556
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,200
you can put anything in there and so I

557
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,610
made up a fake name I made up a

558
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,440
recruiter called Kathleen or something I

559
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,630
looked up I looked at by the company

560
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,220
that she might want that she might have

561
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,900
heard of like a company knew where she

562
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,120
lives and made up a name that looked

563
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,340
like my work there using advanced Mike

564
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,370
didn't stalking techniques and so that's

565
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,050
how I made that person and then here's

566
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,810
exactly what I sent her in for so I

567
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,890
don't know if you can read that so I'll

568
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,990
tell you about it um it's from Kathleen

569
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,670
wheeler and there's an email address you

570
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,430
can email it's just me and it says hey

571
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,849
I'm working for some comedy company and

572
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,200
somebody applied to work with us and

573
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,000
they listed you as a referral and they

574
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,260
said that you were together at the same

575
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,589
University so here's the resume can you

576
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,319
please click on the resume and tell us

577
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,910
how do you know this person because they

578
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,430
said they know you and the link to the

579
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,260
resume but the link really goes to my

580
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,630
fake bug in screen and then there's this

581
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,010
random form afterwards like can you

582
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,240
confirm the dates can you rate this

583
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,560
thing on one to five blah blah blah this

584
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,820
is just meaningless it's just meant to

585
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,200
be a distraction so after you see the

586
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,550
link you're there's more for you to read

587
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,350
and then at the bottom it says hey I

588
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,970
want to call you about this can you let

589
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,260
me know a good time to call you it's

590
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,670
this phone number correct and that's how

591
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,470
real phone number and so the friend

592
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,910
number makes it seem like this person

593
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,050
actually knows you and makes it seem

594
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:45,970
legit as opposed to spam and then having

595
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,420
made some fake email

596
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,190
things like a pipe and everything just

597
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,600
people who work at companies have email

598
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,150
signatures and stuff and so that link

599
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,490
goes to my fake login screen and so I

600
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,900
could send this to her and she clicks on

601
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,310
it and she goes to the fake login screen

602
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,750
and it works and she the type Center

603
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,460
password and everything but if you look

604
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,050
closely you'll notice that the password

605
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,880
that you've tapped in to my logs is the

606
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,200
part that she typed into my face login

607
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,700
screen is the same one from the tumbler

608
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,450
dump so like this I already have this

609
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,700
password so I'd like it's just like the

610
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,290
third try on something and she did type

611
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,000
in a password but I already have this

612
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,350
one and so what I've learned from this

613
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,880
is that this is some next-level

614
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,370
gaslighting stuff because she doesn't

615
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,900
know what her login password is like she

616
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,920
doesn't know how to log into a hotmail

617
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,090
because she'd obviously typed in the

618
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,920
wrong password but because my fake logon

619
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,450
screen accepts any password now she

620
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,660
thinks this is hello password because it

621
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,170
just says yes and so this is where I'm

622
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,090
at now and I'm like very stressed at

623
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,320
this point because I really thought it

624
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:42,920
would be over by now

625
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,780
and so I make up this new login page

626
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,880
doesn't that over yet and this look this

627
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,580
login screen is slightly different and

628
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,020
it's the same as before but no matter

629
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,190
what you type in the first three times

630
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,190
it just says no wrong password and if

631
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,360
you type in that password from before if

632
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,160
you type in QWERTY one the counter

633
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,390
doesn't go up so you can't type in that

634
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,170
one and so I send this to her and but

635
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,820
how do I send it to her well she replies

636
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,100
to my email she replies to Kathleen got

637
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,200
him and says no I haven't worked with

638
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,490
this person that you made up I went to

639
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,510
great lengths to make it convincing

640
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,860
looking words made by the way but I have

641
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,810
not included it here and she said yeah

642
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,830
you can call me this is the right phone

643
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,510
number and so then I'm like okay now you

644
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,260
just sent her a different Google Doc

645
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,790
okay let's just go for this and so I

646
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,100
reply using a different font because I'm

647
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,750
Anna stressed out office worker and I've

648
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,340
got a copy and paste the template but

649
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,200
I'm typing in a different font because

650
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,060
this is me instead of the copy and

651
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,200
pasted template this is what I'm

652
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,610
thinking about and I said oh that's the

653
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,290
wrong resume so sorry - exclamation

654
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,950
marks office worker and I got a mixed up

655
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,670
or something

656
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,280
so here the different link just try this

657
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,870
again I send the same email different

658
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,460
link and I changed the names and the

659
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,930
dates and make a whole new fake resume

660
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,030
very hastily and of much low quality and

661
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,400
I send it to her and this makes no sense

662
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,440
right this is Oh actually this is

663
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,850
actually sent you the resume of someone

664
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:57,290
different who you know and who worked

665
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,850
with you at the same time and you also

666
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,230
reflect this doesn't make any sense but

667
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,550
I thought she might click on anyway

668
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,170
because the hook in this fishing email

669
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,330
is like somebody says they know you but

670
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,440
I'm not gonna tell you who you have to

671
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,030
click this link to find out LinkedIn

672
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,440
also does this and their phishing emails

673
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,970
I mean engagement emails where they say

674
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:13,160
like you know somebody knows you click

675
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,780
here and log in and find some stuff I

676
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,720
don't know whatever and this time she

677
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,610
goes to my site I don't know she types

678
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,720
in the same thing three times there's

679
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,190
this other password which is not one I

680
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,690
already have if you look closer it's

681
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,100
actually quite similar man I did try and

682
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,060
get similar ones but you can get this

683
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,420
one

684
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,280
so I was like okay good take this

685
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,050
password I go to the I use the advanced

686
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,430
hacking technique of opening Google

687
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,930
Chrome and going to hotmail calm and

688
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,400
typing it into the thing using a web

689
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,160
browser and it works we get into her

690
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:44,690
email inbox thing yes and so yep

691
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,450
advanced hacking got it got the email

692
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,300
password yep got it and so I also tried

693
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,010
the same password on everything I tried

694
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,120
on it Facebook and Twitter and LinkedIn

695
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,040
and iCloud which I've owned for my

696
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,630
advanced Google and Google Docs familiar

697
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,520
it doesn't work on anything so this is

698
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,910
like a not a non tech person who has

699
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:03,530
more than one more than two passwords

700
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,320
for other things and I'm very stressed

701
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,370
that it happened to be the person I

702
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,500
tried to do this to you don't you apply

703
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,880
them she's like hey no I haven't work

704
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,200
with this person either what is this all

705
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,490
about why are you sending me these

706
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:17,480
things and I'm like ah you know sorry

707
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,100
maybe it's something happened you know

708
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,600
I'll look into it don't worry about it

709
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,610
do not email me anymore do not think

710
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,170
about this I'm just gonna go away now

711
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,200
and and she doesn't reply she didn't

712
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,510
provider this so but good so anyway do

713
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,440
you know that you can search for stuff

714
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,660
in email you can and so when I went to

715
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,280
the search box of an email and I was

716
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,050
supposed to I was going to like wait

717
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,820
until I thought she might be asleep or

718
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,230
something to log into an email in case

719
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,640
she saw me like doing things in there

720
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,380
but I didn't do that because I'm young

721
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,440
and invincible and so in the search

722
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,810
history in the search thing you can see

723
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,070
the last five searches that she's done

724
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,690
and she searched for some stuff I don't

725
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,460
know but I wanted to search for some

726
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,140
stuff like password because I wanted to

727
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,430
find some more passwords maybe login to

728
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,320
Facebook or something and so but if I

729
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,550
search for password it'll appear in the

730
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,070
history thing so what I did was I write

731
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,990
down these five searches search for all

732
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,550
my stuff and then search for these five

733
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,760
things in Reverse so then when you get

734
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,200
when you come back and look at this it

735
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,490
looks the same because it only keeps the

736
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,260
last five I think Microsoft will know

737
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,550
that it's there's other stuff in there

738
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,210
bid

739
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,800
but in the browser you can tell and so

740
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,880
did it I mean her email I did it I'm

741
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,680
hacking okay I can see all the emails

742
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,180
it's like I did search for possible I

743
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,980
didn't find anything interesting this I

744
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,270
mean normally this is where you would

745
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,290
end one of these things you would say

746
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,970
like yep I did it actually here's how it

747
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,590
works but this talk is called operation

748
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,810
Luigi right and they haven't been a

749
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,240
Luigi's yet and so I'm already in email

750
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,520
and so be ashamed just little this go to

751
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,010
waste you know maybe we should just hang

752
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,390
around for a bit longer so I'm gonna

753
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,530
need I'm gonna need to get into a

754
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,180
Twitter account before we do this thing

755
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,130
so let's just do that real quick but I

756
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,270
want to get into a to account but I

757
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,770
can't lock her out because then that

758
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,570
would violate one of the rules so I also

759
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,030
have to know that because I would also

760
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,890
violate one of the rules and so here's

761
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,300
what I do I'm playing some next level

762
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,070
four dimensional chess here and so I'm

763
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,820
really hoping it works

764
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,910
so I go to go to Twitter and I reset a

765
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,730
password on Twitter and they send the

766
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,500
password reset email to her email inbox

767
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,910
which I'm in so I can see the positive

768
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,250
in that email and so then I reset the

769
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,650
password but I change it to the QWERTY

770
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,090
one thing because I this is the password

771
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,680
that I think she thinks her Twitter

772
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,390
password is even though it's definitely

773
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,740
not because I've definitely tried it

774
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,210
definitely not that but I said what I

775
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,340
think she thinks it is and so then when

776
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,360
she'll get logged out of Twitter because

777
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,220
I've reset her password but then she'll

778
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,630
be like oh that's why my logged out

779
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,190
doesn't have a fit of password she'll

780
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,890
just try this I think and log back into

781
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,600
Twitter as usual and then I do and I

782
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,680
also make sure to delete all the emails

783
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,060
that I generated which I can do cuz I

784
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,340
mean every mails and then I have to wait

785
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,690
for her to log back into her Twitter and

786
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,030
do something because if she's logged

787
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,470
back in and does something then I'll

788
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,120
know she got back in I can't ask her hey

789
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,410
you and your Twitter or anything I have

790
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,630
to just wait and so stressful waiting I

791
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,920
think it takes me like a day and a half

792
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,390
or something and then she retweets a

793
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,510
picture of a cute dog oh I'm like yes

794
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,560
sorry she's back in I'm back in while

795
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,730
I'm in it Twitter I like turn all the

796
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,990
alerts and like chatting up the security

797
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,540
and stuff because I'm a good boy and so

798
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,830
I mean have to attain our success but

799
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,000
also I'm gonna need to get into her

800
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,520
LinkedIn it's crucial that we do that so

801
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,840
I got a LinkedIn do the exact same thing

802
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
do the exact same email thing but while

803
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,020
I'm trying to set her password to QWERTY

804
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,700
one LinkedIn says no no you can't use

805
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,320
that password presumably because I got

806
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,760
it out of the LinkedIn dump from 2012

807
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,030
and so I'm like okay fair enough

808
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,550
LinkedIn good calls so like what do I do

809
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,080
now I'll just set it to the same one

810
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,550
it's an email password I said to the W

811
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,410
one and so I do that but then there's a

812
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,029
little checkbox

813
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:29,259
the bottom even if you can read it it

814
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,119
says require all devices to sign-in with

815
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,279
new password so this checkbox says would

816
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,809
you like to clear your sessions and it's

817
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,669
unchecked by default and so I'm like you

818
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:38,019
know what man I'm absolutely good for

819
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,119
that don't even worry about it don't

820
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,679
worry about it just leave those sessions

821
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,109
no need to log down out and so I change

822
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,700
the password and she doesn't even she

823
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,659
doesn't know she doesn't get logged out

824
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:47,859
she's still in LinkedIn phosphors

825
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,210
changed she doesn't know who knows if

826
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,099
she'd leave me hotel and so now at

827
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:53,109
ellington as well and so why did I do

828
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:54,190
all this why did I get into a Twitter

829
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,599
and LinkedIn to explain that I'm gonna

830
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,649
need the help of former US President

831
00:24:56,649 --> 00:24:59,619
Barack Obama so let me explain I did

832
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:00,969
some stuff to Diana's profile pictures

833
00:25:00,969 --> 00:25:02,200
but I can't show you how a real profile

834
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,789
picture and so I've done the same things

835
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:05,349
to this to these pictures of Obama and

836
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:07,059
so on a Twitter picture I just

837
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:08,859
photoshopped in this really subtle

838
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:11,950
transparent Luigi it's like five I don't

839
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,879
know if you can even see it it's got

840
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,409
like five percent opacity and they're

841
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:16,809
just a really trend little little little

842
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,580
subtle Luigi and what apparently she

843
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,659
didn't notice this but apparently one of

844
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:21,249
her friends saw this and that friend was

845
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:23,320
like oh I just thought that Diana just

846
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,580
did that I just thought you just wanted

847
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,249
to do that oh my god okay good and so

848
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:28,659
then on LinkedIn I also did the same

849
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:30,369
thing with some profile be showing liked

850
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:33,309
in different Luigi and so she had that

851
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,109
going on a LinkedIn and so all the you

852
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:36,429
know all the Luigi fans on LinkedIn were

853
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:39,700
like oh yeah and it's like it's four

854
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,049
weeks I just leave it for a long time

855
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:42,549
and like okay I've done it she's been

856
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:44,979
absolutely comprehensively Luigi should

857
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,279
I give up now and I'm like well I mean

858
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,259
I'm like I'm already in I'm already in

859
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:52,089
all that stuff and I'm like already a

860
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,679
Luigi technician by this point so it'd

861
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:54,849
be a shame to let all that go to waste

862
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:56,619
so I think it's time for this to take a

863
00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:58,239
slightly more sinister turn things are

864
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:00,129
gonna get a little bit more a little bit

865
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:03,460
more yeah like that so the rest of this

866
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,589
talk will be operation waluigi so I go

867
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:07,210
to her LinkedIn and this time I change

868
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,469
her profile picture to have a giant

869
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:10,089
waluigi in it I change all of her like

870
00:26:10,089 --> 00:26:13,269
schools and stuff to be like waluigi

871
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:14,679
related but first i make a backup of it

872
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:15,940
so she can change her back later cuz i'm

873
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,210
a good boy and i also change her

874
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,440
linkedin bio thing to be the entire

875
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,669
Wikipedia article for waluigi

876
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:25,690
and and when i do this linkedin says

877
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,099
high profile strength is now advanced

878
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:32,650
so thanks LinkedIn so then I go to

879
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:33,880
Twitter and I change her Twitter to me

880
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,919
this like the picture has got a big

881
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,659
waluigi in it all the names different

882
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:38,950
everything everything is now waluigi

883
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,600
themed and so this is where i'm hoping

884
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,130
that she's going to notice because this

885
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,210
is the point of this is for her to

886
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:44,350
notice to me like whoa

887
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,450
and so i tweeted out this picture from

888
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,650
her Twitter account just so she's just

889
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,240
very clear that this is now a while we'd

890
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,890
you themed account and then she replies

891
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,559
to this with oMG so she happened to be

892
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:54,730
on to it at the same time and she's like

893
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,650
whoa and then she replies to something

894
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,760
else and she said I've been hacked my

895
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,149
dudes and so but then I'm there the same

896
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:02,980
time so I just reply to that saying wait

897
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,600
nevermind no I haven't been hacked I

898
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,860
just really wanted to tell you about

899
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:11,520
well oag that's sent out this tweet also

900
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,020
cuz I can just I can just do anything I

901
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,980
mean her Twitter account its this is a

902
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,990
waluigi themed twitter now and i tweet

903
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,370
out this picture which says longing for

904
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,960
the days of this sweet LED i'm into

905
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,659
those days and so that's that's it

906
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:23,770
that's operation waluigi

907
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,840
but after this i made up with her I made

908
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,070
out with Dana and like interview her and

909
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,330
ask her about all this because she has

910
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,799
no idea how I did this and so I meet up

911
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:31,690
with her and firstly she loves the diss

912
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,309
has happened she loves her new waluigi

913
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:34,270
life she goes and changes although

914
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,679
facebook so after we waluigi themed as

915
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,350
well i didn't do that like she just

916
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,750
wants it to happen and so and she leaves

917
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,610
a couple of those up for a while and

918
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,260
then she says that she's really getting

919
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,240
into waluigi culture lately she says

920
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,649
she's been like follow being on a

921
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,210
youtube adventure she says waluigi is

922
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,919
the ultimate symbol of post-modernism he

923
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,429
exists only as a foil war and so then I

924
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:56,169
show her the emails from Kathleen

925
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:57,520
because she doesn't know how I did this

926
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,169
and she's like what that was you and

927
00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:01,210
she's very stressed about it but she

928
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,070
ultimately likes it and then I also

929
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,299
asked her about Google Docs in Microsoft

930
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:05,559
Word and she said I use exclusively

931
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,240
Google Docs so I'm really glad I didn't

932
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,470
try and do that microsoft word macro

933
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,450
thing because she doesn't use it because

934
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,549
I thought you might use everything when

935
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:13,630
I do everything on her phone and do

936
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:16,480
everything in Google Docs and she did so

937
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,100
we also turn on to factor auth because

938
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,419
boy if she had to factor out this would

939
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:20,200
be a lot harder

940
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,880
I'd have to like do that SMS bypass

941
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,289
thing or like fish the to have a code as

942
00:28:23,289 --> 00:28:24,820
well or like men the middle and steal

943
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,140
the cookies or something and that's all

944
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,000
way too hard for one to be like me and

945
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,860
so we turn or two vector auth and we

946
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,970
talk about security and stuff and she

947
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,190
gets all secure we also put a Twitter

948
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,549
profile on private mode because this

949
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,899
blog post get some hacking used and a

950
00:28:37,899 --> 00:28:39,429
whole bunch of people will find her on

951
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:40,990
like they find her Twitter account like

952
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,460
I did my best to make it anonymous but

953
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,050
and a lot of people who are reading it

954
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,790
and said they were like somebody you

955
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,170
found her a bunch of people found her

956
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,610
and they were like aha hello I know it's

957
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,860
you I know you're Donna and so she loved

958
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,910
it she loved she was like oh I'm getting

959
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,870
all this attention also all these

960
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,190
hacking these comments are great like

961
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,690

962

963
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,380
all the old people finding her she just

964
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,850
she oh she thinks that they're all gonna

965
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,800
ask her on a date or something and she's

966
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,120
like oh maybe well maybe one of these

967
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,860

968
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,480
