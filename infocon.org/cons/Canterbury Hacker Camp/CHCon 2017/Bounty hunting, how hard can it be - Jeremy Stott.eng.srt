1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,340
[Applause]

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,859
this one get away I'll use this one cool

3
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:07,200
so yeah hi everybody my backgrounds in

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,970
software engineering and a bit of system

5
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,090
engineering and then about four months

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,940
ago there was a job going for a security

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,500
engineer and well you don't get it if

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,840
you don't apply for it so fight for it

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,619
and then Here I am which is awesome and

10
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:23,699
I'm gonna talk to about bug bounty

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,430
hunting how hard can it be so ideas I

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,750
submit this talk well you know it could

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,490
go either way right I'll submit the talk

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,779
if it's really easy then that's the talk

15
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,630
it was really hard at that to talk so

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,500
we'll find out I said key week on one of

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,690
the after parties and I was talking to a

18
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,460
guy he said are moving down to

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:41,879
Wellington

20
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,410
so yeah cool you know what are gonna do

21
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,600
you go job is like oh no no I'm just

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,780
gonna do some bounty hunting I'll stay

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,030
in my friend's couch I'm like what yeah

24
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,010
until that moment it didn't really occur

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,390
to me that you could just do that as a

26
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,219
way of you know making money and feeding

27
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,129
yourself so I thought well I should give

28
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,359
there to go is what I'll see see what

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,789
it's all about and I saw this Alec will

30
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,060
come up nick gear unveils world's most

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,670
easiest bug bounty amazing this is this

32
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,770
is for me you know I'm getting started

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,210
Nick gear has had a rough rocky past so

34
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,250
let's have a quick look

35
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,950
yeah how hard can it be so I've gone to

36
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,390
bugcrowd which is one of the two main

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,600
bug bounty platforms finally find their

38
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,450
program register on their site by the

39
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,509
way opposite you go start at the

40
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,299
beginning like if you register with your

41
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:36,240
Jeremy at stock email address and then

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,710
at some point down the line you want to

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,240
hide your identity that's not good so

44
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,579
you got to start at the beginning anyway

45
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,909
this is a public talk so we never mind

46
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,409
so I thought there so it's got $15,000

47
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,790
I'm in the money yeah this is great

48
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,710
I don't need one of these every you know

49
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,040
a few months maybe maybe one a year what

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,390
might do for couchsurfing in Wellington

51
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,500
scroll down the page and you find this

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,000
scope so usually they tell you like okay

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,079
this is the stuff that we want you to

54
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,210
have a look at and it's all this Arlo

55
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,329
stuff this was all a bit like this is

56
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,119
the entire scope and alo is this these

57
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,330
security cameras and and I thought oh

58
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,890
okay basically it's just there

59
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,680
latest product so all those cool a rocky

60
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,959
past Netgear and none of that since cope

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,569
just these ones so went down to debut -

62
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,400
i and sort of soar on a shelf there

63
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,440
it's $367 and and sort of this point not

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,240
really sure if it's a bug bounty program

65
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,340
or just a sales pitch to get me to buy

66
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,090
their product so I'm there you know in

67
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,590
the store I'm arguing with the guy I'm

68
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,120
like oh yeah this is I think this is

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,739
what I want he's like oh really okay

70
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,360
have you considered these ones like no

71
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,709
actually this is the one I want oh

72
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,120
what's your requirements you know uh

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,590
I'll just take that one that's okay

74
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,630
and they gave me a discount so you know

75
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,540
it's great got it for 300 fifty dollars

76
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,550
yeah so just keep like a running tally

77
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,340
of all of the money that I've made or

78
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,140
not made over the course of this project

79
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,769
so there we are it's 350 so of course go

80
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,540
you know open it up I've got this

81
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,890
embedded systems background I want to

82
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,950
see what's inside pull it apart actually

83
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,780
was a really impressive design and I

84
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,310
quite I thought they put a lot of

85
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,830
thought into it would have been held to

86
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,410
design this thing like stack PCBs is not

87
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,820
a great idea I don't know how many

88
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,079
layers these things are but they're all

89
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,549
sort of squished on top of each other to

90
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:24,630
make it look at this beautiful

91
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,920
industrial design thing poor guys so

92
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,350
they did a really great job opening it

93
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,269
up you can it was pretty easy they just

94
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,660
had the Phillips head screwdrivers sort

95
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,880
of taking it apart more things

96
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,070
nothing obvious at this point this is

97
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,860
when you know you've gone too far this

98
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,320
is like the CCD you know I think it just

99
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,610
gets on there that's kind of permanent

100
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,910
and oh well the leans popped off that's

101
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,290
okay I put it I managed to get it all

102
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,329
back together again

103
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,530
of course I was actually taking these

104
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,870
pictures in the hotel room a couple

105
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,610
nights ago because I hadn't taken the

106
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,200
pictures yet I just symbol it at the

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,890
beginning of the year

108
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,720
and I thought oh there's no debug ports

109
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,090
on this thing you know move on that's a

110
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,160
shame until while I was taking these

111
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,829
pictures a couple of nights ago what's

112
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,769
this there's like four little things on

113
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:16,320
the side there there's suspicious

114
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,839
these look like debug ports why did I

115
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,459
not see this at the beginning the year

116
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,550
would have saved me a lot of trouble I I

117
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,800
did happen to pack like a microscope a

118
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,860
USB microscope I don't know why

119
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,849
but I didn't have screwdrivers because I

120
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:33,169
couldn't take him on the airplane I

121
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,849
didn't shake a bag so I had to go and

122
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:36,169
buy some screwdrivers to get to this

123
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,289
point anyway so what would you Mike what

124
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:40,310
would you look for why would this be

125
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,389
interesting this debug port I'll explain

126
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,650
in a minute but so how would you

127
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,620
identify which pins of which and this

128
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,060
one's pretty much obviously ground and

129
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,650
the reason is as you can see like little

130
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,240
star bits goes out to the edge of the

131
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,159
other PCBs that's because it's all one

132
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,800
big ground plane so that one's probably

133
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,110
ground this one's probably power because

134
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,180
you can see the trace is really thick so

135
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,199
you compare to the other one on the

136
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,639
other side and slightly this little thin

137
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,379
one so the thick one that's probably

138
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:07,460
give me the power because it needs to

139
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,139
hold a little bit of current so that's

140
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:11,810
great and these two were probably Rx and

141
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,060
TX for a serial port doesn't really

142
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,169
matter which way round they are because

143
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:16,610
now I only need to try both of them I

144
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,039
don't have to try all four and

145
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:20,330
connecting potentially my computer to

146
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,949
power one might not be such a great idea

147
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:23,689
but Erik stick ones are you generally

148
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:29,449
okay so at the speakers dinner they

149
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:30,740
graciously gave us a swag bag which

150
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,029
included an Arduino I really needed this

151
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,620
it was it was key I didn't have any wire

152
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,789
had two staples and a twisty tie thing

153
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:44,300
so and though those twisty tie things

154
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,529
they're designed to be you know to be

155
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:47,419
bended I'm trying to see if in five

156
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:48,589
minutes bending this thing trying to

157
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,960
break it apart finally got it apart and

158
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,879
sort of and and next thing is go right

159
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:58,159
to my tree no code you've got a this is

160
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,539
basically man the Middle English serial

161
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,789
port right so your your computer's

162
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,919
saying his serial and then the camera

163
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,089
saying here's serial and you kind of

164
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:07,189
swapped them on this Arduino and it's

165
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:08,449
kind of handy because you can you can

166
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,069
change the baud rates independently of

167
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,779
each other so you can leave the computer

168
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,339
board rate at a fast one and then you

169
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,169
can you can iterate through the baud

170
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:17,000
rates of the device you're looking at

171
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,400
and it's probably most likely one of

172
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,080
those ones like there are others but

173
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,699
it's probably one of those and it ended

174
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,580
up being one one five two hundred so

175
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,900
then you plug it in you turn it on and

176
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,969
bang it actually spits out some stuff

177
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:30,169
into your syrup well this is amazing

178
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:32,449
it's like yes but that's all that's all

179
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:36,889
it spits out nothing else so this is

180
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,509
this normally at this point you would

181
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,610
probably see the whole stack trace like

182
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,630
a whole Linux

183
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,940
starting out and and usually like a root

184
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,980
shell like it just like hole here you've

185
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,420
got the debug port you must you know

186
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,700
want to do some debugging so but it

187
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,870
didn't this is great

188
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,310
no no output at all except for the

189
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,580
bootloader and there's a it's got

190
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,780
there's a in boot version um but that's

191
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,090
bad news too because it's this

192
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,520
proprietary thing and it's the same chip

193
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,050
that they're using GoPros and stuff and

194
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,030
that's all there's terrible SDK that

195
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,560
only works on Windows and I didn't even

196
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,510
wanna go there but there's usually a

197
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,460
trick with boot loaders is before they

198
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,840
boot Linux so you can see there it's

199
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,900
jumped to the flash to boot Linux you

200
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,490
can kind of interrupt that if you wanted

201
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,530
to do if you need to you know figure out

202
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,240
how the debugger is working so the

203
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,820
bootloader so sometimes you need to push

204
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,800
a key before it starts really quickly

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,440
and in this case I needed to type a MBO

206
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,660
ot so a.m. boot name is bootloader you

207
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,400
type that really fast and then it drops

208
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,620
you into the bootloader so at this point

209
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,690
it's like hey okay what you want to do

210
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,550
now normally you could just modify the

211
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,320
boot parameters and once you can modify

212
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,550
the boot parameters you've pretty much

213
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:41,840
you can do whatever you want on the

214
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,520
device because you can change what

215
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,260
program it runs when it first starts and

216
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,870
you can enable all sorts of goodness but

217
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,320
here they've done it right you can see

218
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,990
tor is it actually enter enter 60 64 S

219
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,810
key characters so there's some kind of

220
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,650
password this is sometimes if you've got

221
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,240
the name of the bootloader you can just

222
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,490
search for default passwords but because

223
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,780
this was this proprietary thing it

224
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,660
didn't really have that and I tried a

225
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,990
couple of passwords and it prints out

226
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,560
that shower two five six results I don't

227
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,010
know what that is

228
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,480
and after three attempts it's like

229
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,740
password error not doing anything

230
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,500
anymore until you reboot it so I don't

231
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,940
know why they told me it was a char two

232
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,920
five six

233
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,910
but actually that's potentially really

234
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,430
bad news for me so the hint is that

235
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,680
they're using a hash of the password

236
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,150
this they had code in the past but

237
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,370
they're only storing the hash so even if

238
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,830
I ripped out the flash and got at the

239
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,659
actual pass because I've got it you know

240
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,370
it's in my hands I've got the password

241
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:42,740
it's just in this device even if I got

242
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,200
edit I'd only be the hash so I don't

243
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,170
know what key generates that hash and it

244
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,670
was salted because you know I'm like oh

245
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,530
maybe I'll just compare my only shot I

246
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,750
was like that wasn't the same so really

247
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,100
really great job

248
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,330
not so great for me so I moved on try to

249
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,700
do some traffic sniffing of the Ethernet

250
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,360
traffic some Wi-Fi camera after all and

251
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,710
the best setup I came up with was to

252
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,290
have a virtual machine with two Ethernet

253
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,450
USB Ethernet adapters and then run like

254
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,090
a firewall slash router on the virtual

255
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,380
machine that worked really really well

256
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,970
I've used a number of different times

257
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,400
they're super easy to set up you just

258
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,950
download the pfsense you know while

259
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,590
firewall you just basically install it

260
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,180
and it's good to go straight away and

261
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,830
you've got this nice web UI you can

262
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,390
configure it and everything you can

263
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,310
route traffic to your proxies you can

264
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:33,260
just this is like a whole world to

265
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,030
explore and packages you can install so

266
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,360
that was really cool but unfortunately

267
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,210
and if you guys seen this error for your

268
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,700
cakes is not private you know that the

269
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,470
camera didn't trust my dodge you see

270
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,520
that and angels are Nikki I didn't well

271
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,690
I'm not sure whether Nikki I trust the

272
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,980
Dodge you set up but it definitely the

273
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,180
camera didn't trust da-da-dah

274
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,710
so normally you can just click you know

275
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,020
advanced okay you don't click that right

276
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,600
you you go this is a big problem but if

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,100
you were in if you're debugging and you

278
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,480
knew what you're doing you could click

279
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,710
through this and go yes I know that this

280
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,260
is not Bella's certificate but you can't

281
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,610
do that on the camera I don't have a

282
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,800
keyboard attached to it so that was a

283
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,980
bit of a bit of a blocker for me the

284
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,630
last kind of thing input method for this

285
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,970
camera was a QR code which is when you

286
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,220
set it up you give it your wireless you

287
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,710
same password and the web UI tells you

288
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,180
scan you hold your camera in front of

289
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,130
this and then it scans there's an it

290
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,300
connects to my Wi-Fi network so

291
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,830
potentially my wife ID credentials are

292
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,850
in there maybe you could project your

293
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,100
own QR code through the window someone

294
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,570
else's house well the camera was sitting

295
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,090
I don't know I never really got that to

296
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,240
it about the same time Matthew Garrett

297
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,590
whose security was he tweeted out the a

298
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,630
Louis smart camera system security wise

299
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,050
basically acceptable oh no you know for

300
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,520
IOT devices basically except it was

301
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,920
really high praise

302
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,709
and then as a reply to that you know is

303
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:58,970
about the highest praise you've seen

304
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,230
Matthew Gehrig of anything ever so this

305
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,189
is not great a few months later I

306
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:08,269
actually did find something in the

307
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,339
camera I can't tell you about it because

308
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,829
it's not disclosed yet I might not have

309
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:14,720
needed to actually buy the camera right

310
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,230
this one that's okay though submitted in

311
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,149
August payment in October so it actually

312
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,279
takes quite a long time to get paid for

313
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,319
these things but I'd like yeah I've got

314
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:29,139
some money my current rag on bugcrowd

315
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,569
2217 I'm getting there really love the

316
00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:35,559
talk the first thing so inspirational I

317
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:37,220
how hard can it be

318
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,799
I'm happy now you know update my total

319
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,299
not quite in the black yet but yeah so

320
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:46,249
night 9 days is a long time and you'll

321
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:47,899
be prepared to wait so it's not going to

322
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:49,489
be very fast if you'd move to Wellington

323
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,589
already you know you'd be in trouble for

324
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,239
a few months

325
00:11:53,239 --> 00:11:55,009
make sure you read the policy so on the

326
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,449
page they give you a big policy and

327
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,769
there's a whole bunch of hints in there

328
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:59,360
so like what they want you to taste and

329
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,509
maybe they reveal some things in there

330
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:03,529
but you got to read that policy it's

331
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,419
kind of like your only guide at the

332
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,819
beginning and maybe do some recon before

333
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:11,029
you buy the hardware so there's a bit of

334
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,999
a side quest here and it mean we did it

335
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,169
we launched a vulnerable us closure

336
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,610
program which is kinda like a bug bounty

337
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,860
but just for kudos on their platforms

338
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,299
and so it's kinda like a bit of an

339
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,970
insight from the other side it's a

340
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,579
couple of stories I guess just to give

341
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,610
you an idea of how it went

342
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,169
hello duplicate submissions so we have

343
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,939
the submission on the Left which says

344
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:34,069
you know stored someone says cross-site

345
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,720
scripting they gave you a description

346
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,759
they gave you some steps to reproduce it

347
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,559
and here's the impact this was great you

348
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,899
know hey thanks very much can't confirm

349
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:44,689
new valid vulnerability awesome and then

350
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:46,489
also someone had submitted like this a

351
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:48,709
Cee remote code execution and there's

352
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,139
attached a video right and so there were

353
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,789
a couple of us looking at this so we

354
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:54,499
didn't both look at the same tickets

355
00:12:54,499 --> 00:12:55,549
this one went to somebody else because

356
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:57,499
of a potentially higher higher priority

357
00:12:57,499 --> 00:12:59,119
and you know what do you do with the

358
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:02,929
video oh yeah oh god do I trust VLC now

359
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:07,119
I don't know so yeah a vm later and

360
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,099
transcoded at first and then run the

361
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:11,859
video just like see some grainy mouse a

362
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:15,339
screen capture thing not great but

363
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:16,719
actually we found out that hey hang on

364
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:17,799
this is not our year

365
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,209
this is actually stored cross-site

366
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:21,009
scripting and not any sort of Christ

367
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,109
cross-site scripting it's that stored

368
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:25,419
across that's very saying one but this

369
00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:27,579
guy reported at 2:01 p.m. and the other

370
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:30,729
guy reported at 2:15 p.m. so great

371
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:32,859
thanks reporting but now go give it to

372
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,299
the other guy and say hey this is the

373
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:36,609
duplicate really sorry about that and we

374
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:39,519
learned not to say can confirm new valid

375
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,889
vulnerability maybe just adjust the

376
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,329
language of it to be you can confirm

377
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:46,059
this is a vulnerability just in case

378
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,369
later on you to go back and tell him

379
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,939
it's a duplicate we also had one where

380
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:52,929
someone would say hey here's a

381
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:55,719
vulnerability here's a URL you go to URL

382
00:13:55,719 --> 00:13:58,809
you'll figure it out kind of thing after

383
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:01,029
hearing the talk yesterday morning I

384
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,799
could say five minutes and someone's

385
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,869
already duplicate I can see why people

386
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:05,319
do this

387
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,509
but it makes it really hard for the team

388
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:10,199
on the other side and then they comment

389
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:13,329
also dumb - and also number three these

390
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:16,959
things well know so hey man one one

391
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,029
really per report but ok we'll look at

392
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:20,309
the model because they're all important

393
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,359
and then somebody else have been spawn

394
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,559
with them - they've actually taken some

395
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,689
time descriptions dip's reproduce an

396
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:29,169
impact but oh they reported it after the

397
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,269
original guide reported it so it's kind

398
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,219
of like hat breaking like great report

399
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:35,049
thank you very much but sorry this is

400
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,439
also a duplicate so don't submit PDFs

401
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,849
video onlys documents VirtualBox images

402
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:44,909
wouldn't actually get those but anyway

403
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:47,229
makes it really hard just be

404
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:49,439
understanding about triplicates and

405
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:52,059
clearly state your findings so if you're

406
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,529
gonna be quick just make sure it's very

407
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:57,999
clear what you found we also added any

408
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,549
updates we called it so there might be

409
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:02,079
some vulnerabilities for example tick

410
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,089
checking and it's like great thank you

411
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:06,189
can take 90 days and then think sort of

412
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:09,639
five days later so sir any updates this

413
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,599
is the most time that I've been called

414
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,309
sir as well on this program it's quite

415
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:12,839
incredible

416
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,519
not yet can take 90 days it's with our

417
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,679
engineering team it's like any update

418
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:18,899
sir

419
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,830
like I know still

420
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,830
updates will you know you know and then

421
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,570
they just put a question back so what I

422
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,290
do with that

423
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,330
I put an exclamation mark I don't know

424
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,890
we have some people siblings things that

425
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,930
not in scope so like hey here's this out

426
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,690
of scope thing and I found it and we say

427
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,040
thanks very much but that's out of scope

428
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,470
of our program and he says are you sure

429
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,480
I think you should look at go back and

430
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,490
have a look I'm not this is actually

431
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,040
definitely a problem and it's like quite

432
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,660
embarrassing to go back yeah you're

433
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,680
actually you're totally right this is

434
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,300
very important very important

435
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,820
vulnerability you've reported and the

436
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,380
meantime someone else had a very great

437
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,590
report you know their time was 3 p.m.

438
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,080
and you'd already told them hey you know

439
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,170
you this was a great vulnerability

440
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,160
you've adjusted your language which is

441
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,720
great but you still have to go back and

442
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,130
tell him this is a duplicate so you'll

443
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,750
resist that urge to ask any updates and

444
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,610
I felt that with the camera that bug I

445
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,500
said it was Nick here it was a long time

446
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,060
and I'd written my report

447
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,490
you know nice report and it's just that

448
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,170
once they confirmed it there's you just

449
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,100
what you just gotta wait you know

450
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,180
they've got a whole bunch of other

451
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,410
things they're working on it's gone into

452
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,720
the backlog it's you know who knows how

453
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,290
many how their product team works so it

454
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,510
really is quiet I can see why people get

455
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,210
a little bit you know wondering what's

456
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,770
going on I was checking my inbox every

457
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,910
couple of days like oh I wonder if

458
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,130
they've wonder if they've you know send

459
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,050
me messages or if I paid paid me or

460
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,120
whatever and don't really anything

461
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,030
that's clearly out of scope and or also

462
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,280
you know clearly state what you found so

463
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,640
you can avoid mistakes potentially on

464
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,660
the you don't know who's gonna be

465
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,520
reviewing your you know submission it

466
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,750
could be someone who with a lot of

467
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,160
security background it might be someone

468
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,410
you on the team so if you're as clear as

469
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:08,970
possible you're gonna get results I

470
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,930
think finally we have multiple

471
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,329
personalities so we had a probability

472
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,099
three bugs found you know number ones

473
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,390
this number two is totally unrelated

474
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,510
number three is kind of related and then

475
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,949
they've commented hey this is Bob report

476
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:23,740
another one any updates and then hey

477
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,000
this is Jared number three they're

478
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,699
pretty slow responding to this and then

479
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,260
like yesterday Chris so they're having

480
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,000
this conversation in one account you

481
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,560
know awesome cells on our on this

482
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,040
comment list

483
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:37,739
what do you do about there so it's

484
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,600
public record you know so you've got to

485
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,820
embrace it you can go back to them you

486
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,139
always gonna be courteous and respect

487
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:45,269
people because you don't know what

488
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,159
background they're from and actually to

489
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:48,720
be honest different cultures backgrounds

490
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,429
thinking patterns they're great for bug

491
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:51,450
bounty hunting they're gonna find

492
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,389
different bugs so it can be intimidating

493
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:56,309
sometimes the bug bug grantee programs

494
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,309
can help out with more tricky tricky

495
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:03,629
submitters but overall pretty cool so

496
00:18:03,629 --> 00:18:05,970
that's the side project the side quest

497
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,889
complete we come back to doing some more

498
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,759
hacking on my bug bounty Quest I know

499
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,399
I'll take a switch not that switch like

500
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,299
this switch yeah how hard could that be

501
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,999
they had a bug bounty program on heckle

502
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,820
one to twenty thousand US dollars now

503
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,379
I'm in the real money yeah mm

504
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:26,039
that was nothing

505
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,499
twenty thousand they had a whole bunch

506
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:29,909
of things in the scrub didn't really

507
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,559
understand but I thought I know I'll get

508
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,980
to that later how hard can it be so I

509
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,690
bought the switch that was 5:35

510
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,230
I bought the game because you know you

511
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,850
can't like have to switch it up the

512
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,500
game's not gonna do much right I don't

513
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,170
know why I bought the second game I was

514
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,840
in Hong Kong I was on special and I

515
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,550
bought the HDMI too used to be adapter

516
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:56,530
thing I didn't really need that case to

517
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,940
keep it safe right I don't break it now

518
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,810
they spend all this money on yeah so

519
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,950
basically this whole talk was so I could

520
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,540
tell my wife I got to buy a switch for

521
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,470
what purposes one other cool thing about

522
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,180
the switch is it's more popular Hardware

523
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,220
so they're like some tear downs on it

524
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,840
the people have picked a tap a but

525
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,040
really people are trying to hack it for

526
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,050
homebrew so you know I've got an x-ray

527
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,880
of it I couldn't never get anywhere near

528
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,920
like that with my own tools right so

529
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,540
that's pretty cool I can have a look

530
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,880
inside it before actually opening it and

531
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,280
potentially breaking it so that's pretty

532
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,630
cool there some cool pictures I didn't

533
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,210
really find much out on those they did

534
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,860
list a whole bunch of chips that were

535
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,180
used inside it which is great I don't

536
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,380
have to go and open it up and find that

537
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,810
now if I was potentially interested in

538
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,370
Bluetooth you know it's like Oh tell me

539
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,290
what chips it's using maybe I could go

540
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,390
to the website download data sheets and

541
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,790
all that good stuff so I still haven't

542
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,050
opened this which technically didn't

543
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,920
need to buy it at this point either

544
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,350
because well that's online I don't need

545
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,560
to switch to get that but anyway so I

546
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,640
went back to my sniffing sit-up

547
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,350
basically mostly the same except now I

548
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,270
had a wireless component because I

549
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,040
didn't buy the USB Ethernet adapter for

550
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,180
the switch I stopped myself at that

551
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,480
point and it was actually bit harder to

552
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,860
get the Wi-Fi going anyway back to that

553
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,150
you can also just set the proxy settings

554
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,620
on the switch which is which is a lot

555
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,000
easier you can just tell the switch when

556
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,800
he connected me up hey here's a proxy

557
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,700
over here you should probably be using

558
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,070
and that proxy happens to be my you know

559
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,650
man the middle proxy or my Zep proxy but

560
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,440
that's okay it'll it'll try and use that

561
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,520
and these guys did even better than the

562
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,770
last guys and not only were they

563
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,920
checking certificates they'd had created

564
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,690
their own CA like what Ryan was talking

565
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,600
about so they had a CA and for every

566
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,700
device that they manufacture they put a

567
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,280
unique certificate on the switch and

568
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,050
then when you switch tries to connect to

569
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,120
their servers it says hey here's my

570
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,040
certificate and the service can say oh

571
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,440
this this actually has been signed by

572
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,180
our root certificate so great I'm going

573
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,070
to trust your switch and but the unique

574
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,029
per device as well

575
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:53,379
they could potentially attract which

576
00:20:53,379 --> 00:20:55,059
switches of which and they could also

577
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,279
deny someone from attending to the

578
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,529
website as well so this is bad news

579
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,359
technically I also have this certificate

580
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,889
that's privately I've got the switch in

581
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,690
my hands it's in there somewhere maybe I

582
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,940
can get it out and if I can get it out I

583
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,469
can put it in my proxy and then trick

584
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:13,119
Nintendo into thinking that the proxy is

585
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,149
actually the switch

586
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,549
unfortunately the private keys for the

587
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:21,009
switch certificates are stored in the

588
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:22,869
trust owns trust owns a special part of

589
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,239
the processor that is Awards the highest

590
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:27,369
bounty if you crack it so it's probably

591
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,479
gonna be next impossible for me so that

592
00:21:31,479 --> 00:21:33,099
was a bit of a bummer I also saw these

593
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:34,690
tweets it's really just happening when

594
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,859
you see these tweets come out when

595
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:37,419
you're working on this well we got the

596
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:40,899
kernels so that's great how did you get

597
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:44,229
the code oh we got the news Santino

598
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:49,539
switch trusts own code because all these

599
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:50,739
people are working on trying to get this

600
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:52,089
you know crack it foot to put their own

601
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:53,919
programs on it run the like homebrew

602
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,369
things so yes it's kind of like oh no

603
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:01,690
you know so I changed to act a bit and I

604
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,279
thought okay what about screenshots so

605
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,779
the switch has this functionality you

606
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:06,549
can save a screenshot of your game and

607
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:08,379
it puts into this element for you so

608
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:10,119
well you know maybe I can put my own

609
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,529
pictures in the hip maybe there's a JPEG

610
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:14,889
vulnerability or something how can this

611
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:16,239
be well I realize I had to buy an SD

612
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:17,669
card

613
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,859
I didn't technically need the 128

614
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:22,289
gigabyte seeker they might be right for

615
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:23,789
games later on I don't know

616
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:27,989
so so first its throw a JPEG on there

617
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:29,999
and I got these little you know gray

618
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:32,039
boxes with question marks okay that's

619
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,929
not great that's not good so I had a

620
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:35,190
look at the files that were on the SD

621
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,459
card took a bunch of took a bunch of

622
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:40,049
screenshots and this is weird files

623
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:42,479
there's a timestamp and is this hash

624
00:22:42,479 --> 00:22:44,489
thing usually it's the same but not

625
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:46,049
always so I don't know what was going on

626
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:46,499
there

627
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,079
the first of January 1980 is like the

628
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,109
beginning of time for fat32 actually my

629
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,659
128 GB SD card didn't handle that time

630
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:56,489
format because it was like a exFAT or

631
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,499
something and so I did like resort to a

632
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:02,789
four gig mr. cat already had there it's

633
00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:07,679
okay so I thought I'll do I'll just copy

634
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:08,940
one of these files and change the

635
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,459
timestamp maybe that'll work still you

636
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:13,139
know this great question max this weird

637
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:15,329
like really duplicate the file like a

638
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,209
sanity check DD input file output file

639
00:23:18,209 --> 00:23:19,619
these are the same you know

640
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:23,309
still nothing so okay maybe maybe I'll

641
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:25,019
look at that time stamp because they had

642
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:26,579
the first of January and my copied file

643
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,979
was you know 28th of October maybe I

644
00:23:28,979 --> 00:23:30,629
need to set mine to the 1st of January

645
00:23:30,629 --> 00:23:32,489
maybe it's checking back so you can do

646
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:34,229
that in Mac you can attach the file

647
00:23:34,229 --> 00:23:36,359
let's change the date modified and then

648
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,769
you also you just changed it created

649
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,179
which you can use in Mac you can use a

650
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:42,299
set file still got this random question

651
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:45,539
mark what is going on here so I look at

652
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:48,419
the excess data of the JPEG you can use

653
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:49,919
exif tool and it just prints out a whole

654
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,389
bunch of metadata that's stored inside

655
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:55,289
the jpeg and so kinda tells you where it

656
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:56,579
you know which camera made it in this

657
00:23:56,579 --> 00:23:59,279
case it's a nintendo camera there's a

658
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,749
whole bunch of extra information what

659
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,399
size it is resolutions

660
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,159
you know pixel densities and i had this

661
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,769
interesting warning and categorize

662
00:24:07,769 --> 00:24:10,679
unrecognized macca notes but what a maca

663
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,779
notes hey look at that and it's this

664
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,570
binary format that you can use in the

665
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,459
camera's menu manufacturer-specific and

666
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:18,629
you can just save additional things

667
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:20,549
about your camera or you know maybe

668
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:21,869
you've got a new camera with a special

669
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,519
focus setting and you want to encode it

670
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,609
in this in this make a note so hey look

671
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:29,700
at that these these bytes here pretty

672
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,320
much maybe just some length settings

673
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,910
some heading pretty useful it's not

674
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,610
interesting so they've got to these two

675
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,900
but these two sequences of bytes this

676
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,340
one is actually that hash thing on the

677
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,080
end of the file name interesting

678
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,790
so let's actually encoded in the

679
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,160
metadata as well as in the file name but

680
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,520
what's this thing so back to Twitter

681
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,160
yeah someone else had already found this

682
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,350
as well of course as a while ago as well

683
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,310
as in July but he found out that you can

684
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,510
sign in quadruple air quotes then from

685
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,620
your PC pretty easily

686
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,900
so that was interesting and he linked to

687
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,950
this page that basically said the JPEGs

688
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,660
Mac which is that key that we're

689
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,850
interested in this is extracted from so

690
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,620
this is the code internally in the

691
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,630
switch how it verifies us extracted from

692
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,670
the exits make a note the time some of

693
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,860
the file name must match the timestamp

694
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,410
stored in that exif data that's why I

695
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,520
was getting most of those question mark

696
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,440
so I just copied it because my file name

697
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,950
change that my exif data didn't change

698
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,420
and the store Dixit from a keynote has

699
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,100
been cleaned with zeros and then they

700
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,760
run this H Mac shower to five six across

701
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,880
the entire file and then using a secret

702
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,780
key how coded secret key that was what

703
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,300
that was the the trick I needed must

704
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,730
match the extracted Mac well what's the

705
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,680
key you know so contemplated okay how do

706
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,560
I get this key I don't have a dump of

707
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,390
the flash because I haven't finished

708
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,880
Zelda yet and I don't want to I don't a

709
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,320
break the game break the console before

710
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,690
I finish it so you know it's been a few

711
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,030
hours maybe keep looking for this key

712
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,890
and it turned out the guy that

713
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,210
originally tweeted it said it was in his

714
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,130
paste bin on some house like someone's

715
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,120
like some was like why is it why have

716
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,980
you give us the keys I was in the paste

717
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,400
bin all along so so that wrote some

718
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,560
crappy Python which basically does that

719
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,590
process that you we were talking about

720
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,850
and then I also wrote some screen

721
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,360
captures things to take us capture my

722
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,710
screen and then dump that on to modify

723
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,240
the EXIF data you're not really meant to

724
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,120
be there so right right now I'm actually

725
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,760
like running this on the switch it's

726
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,350
[Applause]

727
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,730
yeah don't stand on expert mode both of

728
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,900
those were like really great really

729
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,390
great things to have if you're running a

730
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,620
bug bounty for an IOT device you

731
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,170
probably know what you're doing and have

732
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:01,700
a plan and follow it so you can get this

733
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,900
happen but if you have stick to your

734
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,240
plans and you can keep going you know if

735
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,900
you've got Mentors

736
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,640
has to hit the map or people on Twitter

737
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,980
that you can ask for questions and good

738
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:13,340
fan can't get expensive a little a sweet

739
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,700
loot that I got actually was more like

740
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,090
that this is $150 yeah that's okay

741
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,760
future work and blue born maybe look

742
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,440
into the blue tooth from the talked

743
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,730
earlier the blue cheese tech smash it

744
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,620
looked really cool there's a new

745
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,850
firmware version that includes video

746
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,680
support in those screenshots so I can

747
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,220
put videos in my slides maybe go back in

748
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,530
brute-force that camera bootloader

749
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,730
64 characters is a lot but I don't know

750
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,020
maybe you can just run for a few months

751
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,829
[Applause]
