1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,500
my name is Karl I work at lateral

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,839
security as a security consultant and I

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:08,970
have quite a few issues of privacy being

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,210
stolen or sold from me

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,210
well objection rather than issues so

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,980
lateral security does security

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,980
consulting work we have 15 technical

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,650
staff and some more support staff we

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,260
offer a variety of services right so

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,349
down to the business what is privacy

11
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:33,600
it's the right to be let alone this term

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,820
comes from ating the late 1800s

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,920
thus it sounds rather funny and modern

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,140
English harvard law book organization

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,140
thing the thing they release started RIF

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,199
that this comes from Daniel Saul's book

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,059
called understanding privacy is so I

18
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,870
heard from Wikipedia so right to be left

19
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,300
alone let alone you don't want people to

20
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,939
bother you you should be allowed privacy

21
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,479
thus the word in its own definition the

22
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,430
option to limit their access others have

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,530
to one's personal information just

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,490
because they're not talking to you

25
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,930
doesn't mean they can't know about you

26
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,640
you should have the entitlement to

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,030
privacy you should be able to choose

28
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,430
what people know about you and what you

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,470
tell others and what people know you're

30
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,799
telling others control over the

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,540
information people have um the Privacy

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,400
Act is very good of this you can

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,960
complain and they will do something

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,970
about it hopefully and you hit another

35
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,890
for additional concepts which I didn't

36
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,020
find interesting so why do I care this

37
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,659
is an interesting story I was away on

38
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,540
holiday taking a flight not quite in a

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,500
Zeppelin but still exciting I wanted

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,460
someone to t3

41
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,829
as people do and I got a prompt which

42
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,899
you can't really see down here and that

43
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,190
lovely 720p we have got what is your

44
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,580
address zip code and other stuff there

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,600
and I thought

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,610
well I'm moving here at the moment to

47
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,010
what address do I give them my current

48
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,670
address or my new address I'm picking

49
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,580
this duty-free up and shop why do they

50
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,700
need my address at all so I looked

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,960
through their privacy information

52
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,790
because hey they're asking for some

53
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,310
information and it's perfectly easy to

54
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,860
get out of this by sending an email to

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,470
inquiries at blah saying I don't want

56
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,120
you to use my personal information for

57
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,700
marketing purposes but by the time

58
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,590
you've done that you have already given

59
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,010
them your details in the first place so

60
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,840
yes I took quite a projection to that so

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,330
I thought about it a bit more your

62
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,340
personal information is your name your

63
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,880
email who's got a name here just yeah

64
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,480
some of you don't have names your secure

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,910
email phone number address employer

66
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,580
details appearance and tress hobbies so

67
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,470
all of these things for social

68
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,850
engineering that would help them out a

69
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,160
lot if they had any of that I'm just

70
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,170
you're right to be a little Lauren you

71
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,760
don't want them to have your address or

72
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,350
you don't want unsolicited mail with

73
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,410
email or a real mail so why do people

74
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,570
need with some formation the answer is

75
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,590
they don't but how do they get it anyway

76
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,800
so yes you're no trade off if you want

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,690
to get packages delivered to you then I

78
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,870
guess they need your physical address

79
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,250
you could have a proxy address you could

80
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,320
have a PA box if you want to be there

81
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,060
but what is the trade off to you

82
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,730
I'm giving out your personal address for

83
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,950
me if I'm picking it up in shop I am not

84
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,070
going to give you my personal address so

85
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,460
a Facebook Twitter something Google+

86
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,350
then your Pinterest LinkedIn and

87
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,510
Instagram I'm not too schooled on social

88
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,920
media because it has my personal

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,310
information if I use it so like LinkedIn

90
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,020
is a prime example of who does this

91
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,270
person work for what do they do there

92
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,840
what can I gain out of attacking this

93
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,120
person social engineering and stuff like

94
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,510
that Pinterest has all your interests so

95
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,160
if you want to know what someone's into

96
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,500
stalking them I'm another one that has

97
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,780
your other interests would be tinder and

98
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:25,060
they record all your messages and

99
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,950
someone did an interesting blog post

100
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,770
when they went hi gender I'd like to

101
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,210
know what personal information you have

102
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,460
on me under the Privacy Act of America

103
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,919
you need to tell me and I can amend it

104
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,200
if required so they came out with a big

105
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,640
list of these are all your previous

106
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,820
conversations you said this to this so

107
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,910
this company could do a UI learning and

108
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,280
stuff on that and find your interests

109
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,520
and record that against I believe

110
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,340
Facebook is here you see sorry mechanism

111
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,600
so yeah they could know quite a bit

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,200
about you and the way people get it is

113
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,150
the sign up page hey give us all your

114
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,790
information like a lot of the services

115
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,440
you don't even need a name or an email

116
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,620
address email is for password recovery

117
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,169
yes but your first name and last name

118
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:13,570
why do you need that for a Pinterest

119
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,460
account for instance why can't you just

120
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,320
have here is my anonymous account and I

121
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,919
look at stuff and you remember it for me

122
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,930
and the favorite one down the bottom

123
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,140

personal details here to claim it which

126
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,820
probably gets quite a few people still

127
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,200
unfortunately and hey can you subscribe

128
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,110
to this competition to do that you just

129
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,260
need to text us your email address so

130
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,590
now that I've got hey you've seen the ad

131
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,169
hey we know your text number because you

132
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:52,810
sent it to us and we have an associated

133
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,000
email address for this text number if

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
any of our marketing partners already

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,979
have this email address they now have

136
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:03,940
your phone number as well so how do we

137
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,250
get the digital data some interesting

138
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,979
things here battery indicators there's

139
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:13,539
an html5 feature now to read the battery

140
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,490
state and it requires no prompting from

141
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,190
the user so just play visiting a website

142
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,690
they know if you're plugged in on charge

143
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,520
if you're the type of person who runs

144
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,000
around and 1% battery life nicer time

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,650
general things like that no prompting

146
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,960
from a browser you're for Tory's have

147
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,000
EXIF data so they know when and where

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,080
the photo was taken

149
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,450
assuming your device was up to date and

150
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,040
hit a real time clock

151
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,290
Wi-Fi probes you're shouting out

152
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,570
constantly

153
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,740
as my Wi-Fi available um it really

154
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,320
catches me out as other people I don't

155
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,450
have any social media but I had a social

156
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,860
media presence because I was in that

157
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,310
photo on that person's account and again

158
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,010
messages are fewer using an Apple

159
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,690
messenger not saying that they do or

160
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,280
don't but they have access to your

161
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,440
messages probably and they can make a

162
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,470
profile based on that tinder again was

163
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,540
an interesting one I read about of

164
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,330
that's quite a lot of very very very

165
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,000
very personal information that logging

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,910
and having access to and just general

167
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,940
device compromise and a fun one of let's

168
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,590
buy their data from someone who already

169
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,290
has it what you have noisy and because

170
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,320
you signed yes you can share my data if

171
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,850
everyone because I really want to use

172
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:32,700
Facebook so to get your location we have

173
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,070
got GPS which is an obvious one you're

174
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,520
wearing it in your pocket nearby Wi-Fi

175
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,750
you're wearing it in your pocket and

176
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,840
your laptops also use it so if you use a

177
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,450
browser we're we're ma functionality

178
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,350
it'll use SSID lookup MAC address lookup

179
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,240
from around here and then file it off to

180
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,090
Google if you're in chrome and Chrome

181
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,020
has Google has an archive of this Wi-Fi

182
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,730
access point is located here

183
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,160
you've given me these three that will

184
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,070
put you about here and you get about

185
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,920
half a block accuracy from a laptop of

186
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,520
no GPS nearby cell phone towers your

187
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,590
gain where anything your pocket and they

188
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,470
can find you that was a bit intimidating

189
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,270
context I having really good pizza right

190
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,090
now at the foundry oh so you are now at

191
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,770
the foundry I just told you where it is

192
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,690
or I am about to hit down to the

193
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,390
supermarket you know where I'm gonna be

194
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,549
so it's word related but it gives you

195
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,729
some context of what people are doing IP

196
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:38,659
addresses if you're not through a VPN

197
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:41,280
then your IP address locks you down to

198
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,150
an accuracy of 30 level usually maybe

199
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,680
the wrong 30 depending on your provider

200
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,540
but they at least know you're in New

201
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,950
Zealand and they can tell you hot

202
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,570
singles in your area New Zealand flag

203
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,920
which I'm signing will commencing and

204
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,190
historical information hi at the gym

205
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,779
again this to say my favorite thing to

206
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:02,579
do where do you think I'm gonna be next

207
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:06,600
Tuesday and the interesting one little

208
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,209
story here the hacker known as 4chan

209
00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:10,709
does anyone know the hacking on its

210
00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:15,329
fortune personally so this is it for

211
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,220
those who don't know it's a term coined

212
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,440
by a journalist who thought that an

213
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,560
internet forum was a entity or a single

214
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,320
entity so how a 4chan finds your

215
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,890
location this is a great little story of

216
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,560
Sheela booth any takers for Sheela both

217
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,820
being a good idea not right so he

218
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,860
decided instead of acting I'm going to

219
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,950
be an artist and instead of liking Trump

220
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,480
I'm going to oppose Trump

221
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,860
so he made a campaign called we will not

222
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,160
be divided and he went outside the New

223
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,339
York Museum and had a camera there for

224
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,380
people to go up and say we will not be

225
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:55,950
divided

226
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,870
Trump is empower but we won't let it

227
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,199
stop us so obviously we are in front of

228
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,470
New York art gallery as a kind of

229
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,600
giveaway that that's where he is so they

230
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
went there and they started trolling the

231
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,430
camera on live feed so then he took

232
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,519
objection to that and moved it to New

233
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,560
Mexico at which people don't want to

234
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,800
travel there probably so went fine until

235
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,899
someone was reciting poetry in the night

236
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:23,459
and gunshots were heard on the camera

237
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,089
anyway it's not safe to have this here

238
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,370
so he went what can I do so people won't

239
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,110
troll me but I can get my artistic

240
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,209
message out and he went to the middle of

241
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,910
nowhere planted a flag and a field or a

242
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,550
live stream on it nothing around it and

243
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,269
left that there and then people were

244
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:44,010
watching the live stream and went oh

245
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,829
there's a plane flying that direction to

246
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,769
that direction at this time and there's

247
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,140
another plane at this time and although

248
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,820
it's nighttime now I recognize that

249
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,980
constellation that's and that so it's

250
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,800
looking south okay I'm given those

251
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,029
planes and things we've narrowed it down

252
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:03,120
it up right send someone out there on

253
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,819
the ultimate location beacon is driving

254
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:06,480
a truck

255
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,050
around and afield honking the horn so

256
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,579
they sent someone out there honking the

257
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,079
horn when they heard the honk start to

258
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,399
come up on the feed they knew that

259
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,339
narrowing on and 36 hours later after

260
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,589
he'd potted this camera up and it filled

261
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:24,199
the hacker known as 4chan had located it

262
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,639
so yeah you're not safe from anything

263
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,019
really so these are a sample of personal

264
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:32,610
tracking devices that people would like

265
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,760
to carry around your car fob if the car

266
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,130
knows you're there to unlock then anyone

267
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,750
else that's the same hardware would know

268
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,930
that you're there don't lose me the

269
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,139
little Bluetooth dongles will tell you

270
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,389
exactly where your keys are they'll tell

271
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,079
me exactly where your keys are anti

272
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,970
fifth things are kind of cool to stop

273
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,220
people stealing but if you put silent

274
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,110
alarms around the room you can trying to

275
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,579
see how people are carrying the one I'm

276
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,139
carrying clothing around your shop or

277
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,949
hardware barcodes if you have a barcode

278
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:07,769
that your skin say you want to discount

279
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,899
on your groceries and the cost to you is

280
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,110
just your privacy you have a match to

281
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,170
your name address postal probably email

282
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,180
address and now they know that you liked

283
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,589
playing cucumbers and celery and this

284
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,470
day at this time and happens every week

285
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,930
so now you're felling your privacy for

286
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:31,949
what a $2 discount off broccoli and gym

287
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:33,420
memberships or whatever that car does

288
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,910
that I stole off the internet from

289
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,709
Wikipedia Commons so it's perfectly

290
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:41,069
legal to be up there you scan your card

291
00:12:41,069 --> 00:12:43,680
to say hey I'm allowed in this existing

292
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,899
and the you know such you as you get

293
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,760
access to Cineworld

294
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,620
and the benefactor demo so you know

295
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,420
exactly who's got access to sunny worlds

296
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,889
when you're going there and probably

297
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,620
what you're buying or doing there and

298
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,800
your foreign which has GPS Bluetooth

299
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,040
Wi-Fi cellular to find that stuff and

300
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,019
yeah a web browser to tell everyone over

301
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,819
the web browser or any malicious apps

302
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:12,240
that you install or don't install so why

303
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,449
why do people want your privacy

304
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:17,910
they can sell products to you they can

305
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,750
sell advertising to you

306
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,110
at you yeah I corrected that and selling

307
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,000
your details through marketing partners

308
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
which is whoever they want to sell it to

309
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,850
for the right price and they improve

310
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,130
your experience if you have a better

311
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,910
experience you will buy more from them

312
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,980
you'll visit them more and you will make

313
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,170
them more money so in general your

314
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,740
privacy is a great commodity and

315
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,270
whatever the cost to you you can assess

316
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,070
whether it's worth getting 20 cents off

317
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,440
your broccoli but some are legal

318
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,300
requirements if you're a bank or

319
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,790
financial institute there's anti money

320
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,190
laundering laws they may need to track

321
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,250
your actual details drug laws if you're

322
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,290
buying restricted medicine then they

323
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,850
need to make sure you're not doing on

324
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,450
bulk and you know they don't want the

325
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,860
reason they adhere to these legal

326
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,540
requirements as they don't want to lose

327
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,540
money and why is all this because our

328
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,580
accompanying companies make money and if

329
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,990
they don't make money they're no longer

330
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,160
a company so running a bit fast but

331
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,810
there should be an awesome live demo

332
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,739
Rescue Me networks

333
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,490
boom boom oh look at that

334
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,150
so this is a 50 line Python application

335
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,860
that I wrote or if about 50 lines of

336
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,890
HTML on the front and it's nothing Wi-Fi

337
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,710
probes for every time your phone tries

338
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,810
to connect to something that's well oh

339
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,850
um

340
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,920
check out a prog sign high as this Wi-Fi

341
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,010
access point there and if it is at all

342
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,840
connect in a photo sent it will ask for

343
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,060
the next one and then if it doesn't who

344
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,190
asked for the next one and if it doesn't

345
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,720
who asked for the next one I'll just

346
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,360
scroll the server because getting bigger

347
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,220
hold yourself away but to get yeah there

348
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,370
you go

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,170
anyone recognize themselves up there

350
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,810
I'm congratulations I've sitting in the

351
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,460
front for a farm Wi-Fi turned on on your

352
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,190
foreign oh yeah

353

isn't it pretty this is um vis je s

354
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,530
which makes it very easy and it looks

355
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,680
really cool it's just the Krusty Krab

356
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,160
nori this is Patrick um can't lift all

357
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,710
come on guys

358
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,500
truest goose and perfect gift

359
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,160
yep not trying to name shame I'm just

360
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,810
reading things as they pop up because

361
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,260
it's interesting

362
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,730
anyone recognize he named Mia and

363
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,100
willing to get geo locations based

364
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,530
offers I also try and find something non

365
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,260
hi Carl yes that someone having fun

366
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,840
there I'm getting co-workers taking with

367
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,560
us right so I will pick one that

368
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:20,300
hopefully will show up you see wireless

369
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,310
which is local but let's see what

370
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,490
happens if I double click it does my API

371
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,560
work extremely rate limited

372
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:38,130
no errors are good or I don't have Wi-Fi

373
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,649
go to the center of each of those is a

374
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,399
location that has UC Wireless which is

375
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,100
not surprising although not that

376
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,420
interesting given we probably knew that

377
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,970
so that's got channel hopping on as well

378
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,459
so it probably landed it off right

379
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,309
someone's trying to seek rely me doing a

380
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:14,230
live Wi-Fi tomorrow is not the best idea

381
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,800
oh that happens to be around the epic

382
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,349
center who would have thought yes so now

383
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,689
from everyone out here and the Wi-Fi

384
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,970
making your probe request I can find out

385
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,699
where your Wi-Fi hotspots are um this is

386
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:29,220
using legal dotnet which is a

387
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,000
crowdsourced wardriving application so

388
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,920
yeah I can find out where you love that

389
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:48,130
is all thank you oh and one last slide

390
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:59,410
because I have to just noise by the name

391
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,230
all your questions of course any

392
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,920
questions final slide for questions

393
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,640
because I think I'm running under time

394
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,110
got five minutes as he five minutes

395
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,580
worth of questions on how you're being

396
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,090
tracked while you're being tracked and

397
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,010
anything like that yes

398
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:27,570
that's a good question um so I have got

399
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,700
my own domain and everything I sign up -

400
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,120
I give it that domain at my domain as an

401
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,399
email so as soon as I get an unsolicited

402
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,919
email I can go hey it's coming

403
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,200
- as aimed at this mailbox under my

404
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,120
catch-all and I can go this guy here

405
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,000
he's busted my privacy

406
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,820
which reminds me of a gain topic of the

407
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,960
day um Pizza websites there's a unnamed

408
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,630
pizza company which got popped recently

409
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,480
I'm not blaming anyone but that giggling

410
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,899
in the corner there and someone picked

411
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:03,000
up that it was this company which did it

412
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,830
because he ordered a pizza under the

413
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,240
name for a fifth of whiskers or

414
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,669
something as a jerk and then he got an

415
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,919
email from an unsolicited email address

416
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,350
saying hi professor whiskers would you

417
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,139
like blah and went well the only company

418
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,820
I have given these fake tito's through

419
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,889
was this company that companies preached

420
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:31,409
me not naming any Domino's yep yep this

421
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:34,139
is the main point of the privacy as it's

422
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:34,740
a trade off

423
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,750
you have functionality or you have

424
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,220
privacy you can run around in the

425
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,929
airplane mode but you won't have Wi-Fi

426
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,880
and you won't have cellular

427
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,500
functionality you know I have a brick in

428
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,919
your pocket

429
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,080
so yes why you know playing mode should

430
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,760
work and till you start going around and

431
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,470
reactivating Bluetooth which you can -

432
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,269
an airplane mode and then you're opened

433
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,480
up again

434
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,330
don't deal with them how can they yell

435
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:19,760
at me if I'm not on Facebook yes because

436
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:40,909
it's easy I haven't used it but there's

437
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:43,220
a lot of professional acts like you go

438
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,900
home it'll put your phone and a

439
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,820
particular ringing volume or something

440
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,350
and it work you have a different ring

441
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,840
profile the turning stuff off when you

442
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,450
don't want it's probably fine but again

443
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,280
airplane mode you can still - and

444
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,669
Bluetooth on if you've turned off Wi-Fi

445
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:00,080
and Bluetooth you're still doing

446
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,169
cellular beacons and then I completely

447
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:05,210
skipped over but any of fee if you're in

448
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,039
a physical proximity or your phone and

449
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,169
it's happy then it's gonna start running

450
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,250
out in your fee stuff as well

451
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,100
any more questions

452
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,130
yep

453
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,270
I'm not naming and blaming anyone but if

454
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,650
you think about the information you

455
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,350
provide to others and why they actually

456
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,000
need that information such as duty-free

457
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,679
does not need to know where I live

458
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,720
and if you look at their privacy

459
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,179
policies are all quite honest and hiding

460
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:46,910
that the selling your details it'll be

461
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,200
in the service agreement that you're

462
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,440
agreeing to but it's in the bottom or in

463
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
the middle and you're not gonna see it

464
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,420
but if you look through all your

465
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,800
providers you'll find out how much

466
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,100
you're getting taken from you and again

467
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,230
the bottom line is it's a trade off do

468
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,510
you want to be able use internet if so

469
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,920
you're gonna have to sacrifice some

470
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,050
privacy if you want to use Facebook

471
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:07,520
you're gonna have to sacrifice a lot of

472
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,340
privacy if you want to use anything else

473
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,910
in just the risk that this year and what

474
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:20,650
you're willing to share for the gain yep

475
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,250
so I've only had one real complaint that

476
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,050
I've made to someone cuz I was selling a

477
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,450
house and if you typed in my house I

478
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,720
came up with a flatmate website and I

479
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,340
couldn't do I could deactivate my

480
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,929
account but I couldn't delete my account

481
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:41,809
and no matter what I did that data was

482
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:43,280
still setting the owner deactivate an

483
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,220
account so I emailed them and said hey

484
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,050
privacy act what are you doing I want to

485
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,960
remove all personal data basically the

486
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,150
email goes Privacy Act says you can have

487
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,910
my data for as long as you need it I

488
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,380
don't no longer need your services

489
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,900
please remove my data and this was just

490
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,280
a one-man band or something and the next

491
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,679
day said hi Carla your data is being

492
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,530
removed and then so there's just a

493
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,330
Google entry pointing to a blank thing

494
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,580
and then I contacted Google by the

495
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,760
automated system and said hey this

496
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,990
website has no longer functioning that's

497
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,490
link can you please remove it and then

498
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,650
it took me off Google so if you don't

499
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,150
want your private data out there you can

500
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,500
remove yourself from the internet if

501
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,280
people will comply

502
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:49,020
hopefully guys my answer um oh my cough

503
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,170
um what you could do is set up I'm going

504
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,580
through all the config there are ways to

505
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,280
turn most of the stuff off if you have

506
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,660
professional Edition if you're in a home

507
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,600
edition good luck off there and if

508
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,730
you're really done you can go into your

509
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,330
file and like hostname block a lot of

510
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,640
the microsoft analytics I think it's

511
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,130
called Watson for this stuff and just

512
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,809
look at the traffic going out and go I

513
00:24:12,809 --> 00:24:14,669
didn't ask for that traffic I'm gonna

514
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:18,299
block that domain so you can't do some

515
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,860
but it would be a pain maintaining that

516
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,590
white blacklist of bad marks off links

517
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,450
or any other company you're trying to

518
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:29,520
block oh and another fun thing all these

519
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,320
air tracking things and should use

520
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,850
vulnerabilities because I found a

521
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,419
product which had ad tracking in it or

522
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:38,880
it was an HTTP product and the ads were

523
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,370
loaded over HTTP and man-in-the-middle

524
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,590
resulted and remote code execution so

525
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,820
yeah

526
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,700
adding ads and tracking networks team to

527
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,200
introduce vulnerabilities as well if

528
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,679
you're gonna be that way inclined cool I

529
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,679
think that's about time I'd imagine and

530
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,900
took him

531
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:02,779
[Applause]
