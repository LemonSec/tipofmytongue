1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
I don't know how to follow the pancake

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,980
guy I just that was awesome

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,919
so what I want to talk to you about is

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,080
how so quit pull the iron so first of

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,849
all everyone raise a hand one hand I

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:13,410
don't care which one all right so I just

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,400
want to make sure all the arms work

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,299
because when I started asking questions

9
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:16,890
you guys don't raise your hands and I

10
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,119
don't really know what to do with that

11
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,279
so developers in the house how many

12
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,500
people are developers I'll use security

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,640
guys probably developers too but InfoSec

14
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,340
app sec what I got one hand okay

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,380
all right so what I'm want to talk to

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,700
you guys about is how to build your

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,760
developers who has an InfoSec program at

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,309
their company AB SEC program all right a

19
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,800
couple what I want to talk to you about

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,960
is how to build your developers into

21
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,510
security champions to help you scale

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,149
your program to create safer software so

23
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,910
we're not getting hacked all the time we

24
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,280
heard a lot of highlights I love whiskey

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,230
I want to drink local whiskey so if you

26
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,090
know a good place in Christchurch for me

27
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,440
to drink New Zealand whiskey

28
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,739
I'd love to hear about it so what is it

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,720
what do I mean by security champions so

30
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,000
they are the eyes and ears of security I

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,090
think of it this way you usually have

32
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,860
probably a hundred to one at least of

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,350
developers to app succour even InfoSec

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,170
people and because of that ratio it's

35
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,330
like well what do I do with that so we

36
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,430
need to put some people out in the field

37
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,890
that are on these teams and writing the

38
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,900
software and we give them some training

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,159
we're gonna go into some more details in

40
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,360
here

41
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,549
one of the fun ones is doing CTF

42
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,400
exercises with developers they love this

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,110
stuff it opens up their eyes like wow

44
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,180
that's really cool you teach them how to

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,100
hack and it teaches them how to be more

46
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,479
defensive in their own coding

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,030
alright so Star Wars name I love a good

48
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,380
Star Wars talk

49
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,180
so we're going to talk about the program

50
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,680
talk about how to sell it

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,509
recruiting things that we've learned

52
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,070
along the way so this is becoming very

53
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,930
popular at infoset conferences i've

54
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,490
heard a lot of companies talk about

55
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,159
their security champions program so this

56
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,869
is based upon what we learned building

57
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,750
hours I was part of that that team that

58
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,370
built this team so no no surprises here

59
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,850
right anyone know which one this is

60
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,530
actually this looks pretty good in this

61
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,860
size so that's the latest its Equifax

62
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,260
we're getting hacked all the time and

63
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,720
we're getting owned for really stupid

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,710
reasons so in this particular case they

65
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,660
probably had no idea what open-source

66
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,940
software they were using and when the

67
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,490
CVE was announced like oh that's

68
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,460
interesting struts okay fine and had no

69
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,560
idea till after the fact when we weren't

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,120
rooting around trying to figure out what

71
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,070
happened did we figure out what it was

72
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,260
so companies are doing a real poor job

73
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,330
of figuring out what they're shipping

74
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,190
and putting on the the outside of their

75
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,690
network so all this hardening that we're

76
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,640
doing is getting worked around by

77
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,660
vulnerabilities and software that we

78
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,310
can't prevent we can't put a

79
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,080
compensating control and some in front

80
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,160
of some of these because it's actually

81
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,690
using the things that the software is

82
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,240
supposed to do so talk a little bit

83
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,340
about team sizes and and release

84
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,300
Cadence's around the different

85
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,040
methodologies used in development today

86
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,400
so in your typical waterfall you got one

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,840
to four releases a year that's probably

88
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,730
the best you could ever do with

89
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,200
waterfall and they're very large teams

90
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,930
there are 50 or more people you've got a

91
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,360
bunch of specialists on those teams so

92
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,870
you've got DBAs and you've got you know

93
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,420
developers and quality and everyone has

94
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,300
their own special job when we move to

95
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,730
agile in agile we're talking about when

96
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,990
you get really good at this is once or

97
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,730
twice a month I'm releasing my software

98
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,490
which is excellent and now we've shrunk

99
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,440
the team size we've shrunk from 50

100
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,400
people down to 6 to 12 people now that

101
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,530
has a lot of impacts on how you staff

102
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,360
those teams because what you want is you

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,290
want something that's fully

104
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,420
cross-functional that can build and ship

105
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,490
the software and you need to have some

106
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,650
security expertise on that team so in

107
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,530
your one to four year our release

108
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,020
cadence security has plenty of time to

109
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,280
do their pen testing and all the other

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,080
stuff that we have traditionally done to

111
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,450
secure the software because there's just

112
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,310
so much time built into that that

113
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,858
schedule but if you get to DevOps now

114
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,260
there are companies that do this dozens

115
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,870
of times a day hundreds of times a year

116
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,930
addley

117
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,050
with that same team size so if we look

118
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,150
at how we got here so this is our

119
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,760
traditional waterfall and in traditional

120
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,440
waterfall this is the way we set up our

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
companies right we have people that

122
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,710
write the specifications developers

123
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,590
quality security operations we have a VP

124
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,390
in charge of each one of those they have

125
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,490
their little fiefdom and we do these

126
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,840
handouts we play telephone with each

127
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,270
other and what happens as a result of

128
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,010
that is the person that writes the

129
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,470
requirements has a really good idea what

130
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,700
they want and when they hand that off to

131
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,380
development we get a good glimpse of

132
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,690
that but the farther down the line we go

133
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,310
by the time against the poor operations

134
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,580
people any ops people in the audience

135
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,790
I'm sorry but I'm against the operations

136
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,400
people they don't know what we built why

137
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,260
we built it who was built for how it's

138
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,630
supposed to operate right I've got this

139
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,370
thing it's on fire I need to figure out

140
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,190
how to make it run whatever that means

141
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,100
similarly the development team builds it

142
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,320
quality gets a good first cut at

143
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,910
understanding the trade-offs that they

144
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,020
made but by the time he gets to

145
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,330
therefore our operations guy at the end

146
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,920
he has to write scripts to say I got to

147
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,960
knock your process over every day

148
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,790
because you're leaking resources and if

149
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,260
I don't then production goes down and

150
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,430
then I get woken up in the middle of

151
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,570
night so we've got all these scripts

152
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,490
running all over the place trying to

153
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,970
keep the software up and healthy and we

154
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,700
don't learn from him so my operations

155
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,340
guy his information never comes up he's

156
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,770
too busy and there's no channel there's

157
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,360
no channel provided for me to get that

158
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,010
information so when we moved to agile

159
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,530
the first thing we did was we combined

160
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,880
development and quality we said we

161
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,260
should put you guys in the same room and

162
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,160
now what we call done so in the first

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,120
operation development said I'm done

164
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,010
coding I'm done and they hand it off to

165
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,520
QA in this case now we say it's not done

166
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,740
until you've tested it functionally so

167
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,510
it has to actually work before you can

168
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,980
declare done and then we have the same

169
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,100
silos downstream so with the same

170
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,870
problems but we have a bigger team that

171
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,970
now gets that continuity of the business

172
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,740
intent and the kind of trade-offs we

173
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,120
made but we still don't have that back

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,790
channel when we get to DevOps and we now

175
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,580
put everybody in the same room so I'm

176
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,990
hearing from operations I'm hearing from

177
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,820
developing I'm hearing from quality we

178
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,650
talked about how the software operates

179
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,720
the the mantra is you build it you run

180
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,260
it so

181
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,360
you changed the way you write software

182
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,760
because you're forced to operate it and

183
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,860
we get that nice continuity across that

184
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,860
across that waterfront because now they

185
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,360
understand that the trade-offs of

186
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,700
development made and operations gets to

187
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,260
have their input into how things are

188
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,550
built ok anyone not familiar with agile

189
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,740
process happy to go through it just one

190
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,930
hand anybody ok all right quickly here

191
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,060
the agile methodology so this is a

192
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,210
picture of agile scrum the guy or gal

193
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,070
over there on the far side with a little

194
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,810
lightbulb is our product owner that is a

195
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,810
scrum roll their job is to tell us what

196
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,730
to do and in what order here's the

197
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,990
important things that the company needs

198
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,660
to do and this team needs to do and they

199
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,030
specify it and then we go into what's

200
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,980
called a grooming session and this is an

201
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,750
important part where we talk about the

202
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,310
story and we try to make sure that the

203
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,200
team understands because as a team we're

204
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,880
going to commit to some work in the

205
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,220
traditional waterfall methodology

206
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,120
developers are just do work and then

207
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,830
they pick up the next piece of work they

208
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,100
weren't helping each other in this model

209
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,130
inside of agile we work together to

210
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,810
build whatever we said we were going to

211
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,060
build so we do is something called

212
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,640
planning poker so it's a fibonacci ish

213
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,010
sequence 1 2 3 5 8 13 2014 and then off

214
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,890
to infinity it's relative sizing so a 2

215
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,110
is about twice as big as a 1 so everyone

216
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,280
everyone on the team builds an

217
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,680
understanding of what a 1 or a 2 is and

218
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,900
then we take a look at the work that's

219
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,820
being presented to us and kind of size

220
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,730
it so if this these two rows here are my

221
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,130
scrum team and we each have a physical

222
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,480
deck of cards you could do it on your

223
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,610
phone - more fun with the cards we'll

224
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,290
talk about the story I'll say alright on

225
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,940
three I want you to tell me how big this

226
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,110
story is and everyone's gonna hold up

227
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,960
their card so I'll get a 1 I'll get a 13

228
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,340
a 20 and 2 so the team itself doesn't

229
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,010
understand this story they need to

230
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,570
understand together so we'll talk about

231
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,159
it why is it so easy why it's so hard

232
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,159
what are we missing until we get down to

233
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
something that's kind of cohesive so

234
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,450
maybe we get to a 5 once we do that we

235
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,950
go into a planning session inside of

236
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,480
that planning session we said we know

237
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,150
how about how fast we go and we know how

238
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,830
many story points that we can do so each

239
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,030
one of those things in the backlog

240
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,030
called a story so once we size them we

241
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,350
say alright we're gonna do the first

242
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,390
four items off of that list we're gonna

243
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,760
build it to completion in a sprint and a

244
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,060
sprint is a time boxed piece of work so

245
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,310
say two weeks so in the next two weeks

246
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,450
we're gonna build these four things and

247
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,420
have them ready to go to our customers

248
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,770
we're gonna talk about it everyday in a

249
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,060
stand-up and this is a five-minute

250
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,980
ceremony we talk about what I do

251
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,350
yesterday what am i doing today and am i

252
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,720
blocked and this is where your servant

253
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,220
leader your scrum master comes in

254
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,780
because if I hear things like I'm

255
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,810
blocked that's my cue to go free though

256
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,680
for you up

257
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,540
I'm gonna go remove that block for you

258
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,150
or if you're falling behind and you're

259
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,650
finished early I'm gonna tell you guys

260
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,720
to work together so we get that story

261
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,400
done and make sure that we finish

262
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,990
everything that we planned and then we

263
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,140
go to the end we demo it and we do

264
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,730
what's called a retrospective and in

265
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,740
that we answer three questions went well

266
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,570
what didn't go well and how do we

267
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,390
improve or in my world what sucked what

268
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,890
didn't suck and how do I suck less next

269
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,780
time

270
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,050
security is over here they're not

271
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:01,300
invited to the table they don't get to

272
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,520
talk there they the way we have done

273
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,070
security in waterfall has has fallen

274
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,900
over an agile and it's starting to fall

275
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,060
over into DevOps this is kind of why I'm

276
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,480
out speaking about this what happens is

277
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,550
we test at the end we get this release

278
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,130
candidate I'm ready to go I found 15

279
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,140
things I need you to fix the team says

280
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,050
oh we're gonna release tomorrow can we

281
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,810
just do the important ones so which of

282
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,540
the 15 is important it's probably all of

283
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,830
them but we end up doing is fighting

284
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,140
over budget so maybe you get three maybe

285
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,300
you get five if you're lucky the rest of

286
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,440
them never get seen or heard from again

287
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,180
right they go to the bottom of that

288
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,800
backlog all right so the reason for

289
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,360
security champion so I got to see so why

290
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
do I need Oregon InfoSec team why do I

291
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
need to have security champions the

292
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,580
things that a CEO or an InfoSec person

293
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,630
is responsible for is ginormous I talked

294
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,360
to the CEO of Ticketmaster they're

295
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,160
actually also responsible for physical

296
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
security at events now if you know

297
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,270
Ticketmaster you know how many events

298
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,700
they have every single day he's

299
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,889
responsible for that as well as his

300
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,839
security on all the buildings endpoint

301
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,639
security network security all of that

302
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,100
stuff falls under his domain how much

303
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,449
time do you think he spends on app sec

304
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,129
so if we look at the app sec problem so

305
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,480
again typically you get that hundred to

306
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,149
one ish ratio I've got dozens or

307
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:29,649
hundreds of teams I've got thousands of

308
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:30,699
applications some of the biggest

309
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:32,350
companies of the world five eight ten

310
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,419
thousand applications that they have on

311
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:36,009
their networks that they either build or

312
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:38,079
buy or they stand up open source

313
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,989
software and they're doing a whole bunch

314
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:42,850
of work as well they're reporting cross

315
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,559
org they're doing Atta stations to their

316
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:46,899
customers and they're doing risk

317
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,149
assessments so they are very busy as

318
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,679
well they don't have time so all of

319
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,910
those meetings that we talked about

320
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,470
especially the one where we talk about

321
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,139
grooming they can't attend every one of

322
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:57,579
those for every one of these teams it's

323
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:01,359
physically impossible any red teamers

324
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:06,189
here blue team no team you guys still

325
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:09,249
there okay

326
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:12,009
so if for those that don't know Red Team

327
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:14,669
Blue team is something where you have

328
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:17,079
ethical hackers working for you trying

329
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,600
to break your software as a hacker and

330
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,009
you have a blue team that's trying to

331
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,869
defend against that so you kind of

332
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,660
upskill everybody by continuing to break

333
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,759
and fix the software and protect your

334
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,309
environment it leads to a lot of great

335
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:31,779
learnings that you can take into your

336
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:33,850
threat modeling for your application

337
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,669
teams and it just it leads to better

338
00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:39,360
software it's expensive it's hard to do

339
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,220
you know I the way I think about it is

340
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,360
really should only be used for

341
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,600
high-value targets so I don't want my

342
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,980
ethical hackers finding cross-site

343
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,509
scripting or sequel injection those are

344
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:52,269
just silly I can find those with much

345
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:54,009
cheaper and easier with tools that are

346
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,410
already out there it's also very slow so

347
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,239
anyone that does anyone do pen testing

348
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,089
for a living all right I get a couple

349
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:03,819
pen testings measured on calendars if

350
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,259
we're talking about DevOps and we're

351
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,720
talking about releasing ten times a day

352
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,389
how do you pen test that how can you

353
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,699
possibly keep up with that workload

354
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,319
they're also incredibly hard to hire and

355
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:17,679
keep happy and if you look at the stats

356
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,739
here what is by 2019

357
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:22,700
two million open cyber secure

358
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,270
jobs so if we went in the room here we

359
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,800
got a great future it's contemporary and

360
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,550
the hackers are always ahead of us but

361
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,380
that leaves a huge gap what do you do in

362
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,790
the mean time how do you fix that

363
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,010
problem if you're the lonely AB set guy

364
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,200
and a company trying to secure our 3,000

365
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,730
applications so to be clear now I want

366
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,780
to make sure you understand my

367
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,150
definition of DevOps because when I talk

368
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,070
to a lot of prospects and customers is

369
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,530
what they think it is they consider it

370
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,150
to be the people that write automation

371
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,680
the people that do a little bit of

372
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,960
operations work but it's really it's a

373
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,000
tooling team essentially glorified

374
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,280
release engineers with a DevOps title

375
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,900
but what I mean is this so in DevOps if

376
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,570
you do it well the people that write it

377
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,390
operate it which leads to learning right

378
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,220
the whole intent of DevOps is fast

379
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,430
learning fast failure if it breaks I fix

380
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,960
it I learn from that the next time I

381
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,230
write it a little bit better also

382
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,840
security so security is always we always

383
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,370
do it last why do we do that to

384
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,860
ourselves right it just leads to bad

385
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,070
outcomes this is what we need and this

386
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,100
is why again why I'm out evangelizing we

387
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,630
have to think us about security all the

388
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,120
time whose job is it to do security in

389
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,420
your company thank you whoever said that

390
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,310
everyone you're exactly right

391
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,700
it's everyone's job and yet we don't

392
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,310
treat it that way so I was with John

393
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,750
Willis a couple weeks ago he was a

394
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,880
co-author of the DevOps handbook and he

395
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,020
said you know it would be an awesome

396
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,520
world if I walked into my company and I

397
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,200
let the door slam behind me even though

398
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,090
one of my co-workers who works right in

399
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,980
a cube next to me holding a bunch of

400
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,840
packages in the rain he looks at me and

401
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,370
says thank you because you know one

402
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,960
badge one entry means one badge one

403
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,390
entry when I do that in my company I do

404
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,090
that to our CTO and co-founder he tries

405
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,700
to tailgate behind me I'm like ah we

406
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,710
have to model the right behavior so he

407
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,750
has to badge in we have to think about

408
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,370
that we have to take security seriously

409
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,260
and we have to make everyone take

410
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,060
security seriously so the previous talk

411
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,920
about phishing emails it's the same

412
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,530
thing for your physical security right

413
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,529
you are vulnerable if some attacker

414
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:39,699
gets into your into your infrastructure

415
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:42,829
so can you stop them this is what

416
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:45,560
usually happens you say hey got a gate

417
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,540
you guys got a pass security muster

418
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,660
here's the policy and it's either not

419
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,009
really a gate and they just drive around

420
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:54,769
it or it's the escalating phone calls to

421
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:56,300
my boss until my boss is bigger than

422
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,949
your boss and my says mine says we're

423
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:01,730
gonna ship so we ship or this one which

424
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,459
is also really bad kind of funny when

425
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:05,540
they think there's no gate but there

426
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,759
really is and we stop the product from

427
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,529
shipping or we pull it back out of

428
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:15,019
production so here's the thing literally

429
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:19,730
thank you when I talk to people about

430
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,129
applications security there is one thing

431
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:24,740
more than anything that if you don't

432
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,620
have it everything is hard and if you do

433
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,870
have it everything becomes easier anyone

434
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,670
want to take a guess any brave people

435
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:41,439
out there what's that know anybody else

436
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:46,459
accountability now I was at a b-sides

437
00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:48,889
conference recently where one of the

438
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:50,269
security guys was giving a talk he was

439
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,279
from OWASP and he said we are gonna hold

440
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,610
the developers accountable now I'm both

441
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,860
a developer and a security guy that just

442
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,629
feels really bad to me I don't want to

443
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,970
be held accountable for anything I want

444
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,470
to be told what the rules are I want to

445
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,689
be told what the standard is I want to

446
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:07,010
be given tools and training to

447
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,169
understand how to get there and then I

448
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:11,390
want to hold myself accountable so

449
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,648
that's what I talk about when I talk

450
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:15,439
about accountability it has to be part

451
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,079
of the goals for those individuals it

452
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,669
has to show up and there goes if I'm not

453
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:21,409
measured by it I'm not going to do it

454
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,780
developers are paid to ship software it

455
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:27,409
quickly period full stop that's what

456
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:30,830
they get gold on until the CIO agrees to

457
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,539
put it in his goals and move that

458
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:35,870
downhill this thing doesn't change so

459
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,309
security people try to call their

460
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:38,630
developers they try to get them to do

461
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,980
things but they don't really have to so

462
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,510
you have to find someone friendly it

463
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,429
just makes a big mess where at the end

464
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,720
of the day the company really cares

465
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,010
about this these are board level

466
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,870
discussions now especially after the

467
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,730
Equifax breach half

468
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:56,660
of America their PII was leaked so it

469
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,820
was me my one of my my social security

470
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,660
numbers in that data so selling this

471
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,730
program again what we want is better

472
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,520
outcomes what we want is to have our

473
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,530
influence felt all the way down to the

474
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,240
individual contributor level inside of

475
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,370
those teams so when we talk to

476
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,679
management we're not asking for new recs

477
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,929
we're not asking for new people what

478
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,640
we're asking for is to use the people

479
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,080
that are already there I got people

480
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,940
writing software I got them on the team

481
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,470
they attend every single one of those

482
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,620
ceremonies so why don't we upskill some

483
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,090
of them for the team it's about less

484
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,919
wait time you don't have to wait for a

485
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,480
resource to be available if I'm the lone

486
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,280
the opposite guy or I get a small team I

487
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,610
can't manage to fit everyone in in one

488
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,500
day but if you have someone on your team

489
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,169
that can do 80% of that work guess what

490
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:48,049
you don't have to wait in line and for

491
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:50,540
the individual it's all about saying you

492
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,850
are more valuable to us and you are more

493
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:54,620
valuable to the world so when you move

494
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,419
on to your next job and everyone has a

495
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:59,600
next job when you do that you can put

496
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,850
secure coder security champion you

497
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:05,559
become more valuable you get more money

498
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,169
so describing the job to them now this

499
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:11,900
one came up as well today talking about

500
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,410
Incident Response

501
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,760
they're responsible for grooming

502
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,230
understanding that there are security

503
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,970
implications they're responsible for

504
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,160
creating that bill of materials for the

505
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,010
Equifax type things if you ship software

506
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,650
you want to know what it is because when

507
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,280
the greatest example is if I asked if

508
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,630
you guys were all developers and I asked

509
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,870
you do you use JBoss or do you use

510
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,059
struts in your application it's an easy

511
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:40,040
yes or no I know whether I do or whether

512
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,780
I don't if I've been on this project for

513
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,809
a while but if I say do you use Apache

514
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:48,620
Commons collection 3.2.1 I don't know I

515
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,179
didn't pull that and I didn't include

516
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,390
that anywhere nobody does it's baked

517
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,090
into every single component you bring in

518
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:58,700
and in fact that particular component in

519
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,559
just five generations of open-source

520
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,500
components is in more than 80

521
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,410
thousand packages that means it's

522
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,550
probably in millions of applications

523
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,460
that one version a library that has addy

524
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,320
serialization vulnerability in it that

525
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,470
you can't protect yourself against so if

526
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,490
you don't know that you're vulnerable

527
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,490
how do you even patch so again one case

528
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,180
is very easy one case not so easy so

529
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,000
they become my pee shirt my product

530
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,660
security incident response team so what

531
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,480
I ask of them is here's the CVE I know

532
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,340
it's in your software I need you to tell

533
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,820
me are you really vulnerable so do you

534
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,340
use that part of the component how are

535
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,320
you gonna fix it by when and I need to

536
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,360
know when it's done that's the end of

537
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,370
your job you you bring that out to the

538
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,340
team and get them to respond to it so

539
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,200
recruiting you need at least one

540
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,060
volunteers are awesome voluntold are

541
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,170
okay again i as an engineering manager

542
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,410
I hate bus factors of one so I don't

543
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,610
want to have someone leave the team and

544
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,110
then be without a security champion so I

545
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:15,440
really want to have two all the time you

546
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,510
the other key point here is they need to

547
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,580
be influencers you know the person that

548
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,560
just graduated college is wicked excited

549
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,030
and maybe they're you know do a little

550
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,410
hacking on the side

551
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,170
those people are awesome but may not be

552
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,880
the best fit for someone that comes in

553
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,860
the room and says stop we have to talk

554
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,620
about security now because if they're

555
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,660
less if they're more junior they're

556
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,310
likely to get ignored or rolled over by

557
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,720
people that are more experienced hasn't

558
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,650
been with the team and the company

559
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:45,160
longer so don't make it a new employee

560
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,540
okay they don't know enough about the

561
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,770
product they don't know enough about the

562
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,510
culture they don't know enough about the

563
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,930
team you also don't want to be an

564
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,700
existing scrum rule so I named to scrum

565
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,290
rules that are very important to the way

566
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,850
scrum operates and by the way DevOps

567
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,790
usually runs on some type of scrum so I

568
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,560
have a product owner and I have great

569
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,400
now I go blank down scrum master so

570
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,020
those two roles I don't want to overload

571
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,429
them they are very important rules that

572
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,080
need to be done well and I need the

573
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,790
security champions job to be something

574
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,419
different

575
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,979
because the product owner is the one

576
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:20,839
that sets all the priorities I don't

577
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,969
want him to have one bias or another on

578
00:22:22,969 --> 00:22:25,429
security I need that to be brought to

579
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,119
the table by somebody else now when we

580
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,349
train them we're gonna train them on the

581
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,700
security fundamentals so we'll teach

582
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,820
them about CIA then I by default and

583
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,459
trust no one I also like I said before

584
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:38,869
we're gonna do capture the flag

585
00:22:38,869 --> 00:22:40,579
exercises so for us we do that every

586
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:41,089
week

587
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:44,509
they bring their laptops to lunch and we

588
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:46,249
have some guided exercise okay let's try

589
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:47,599
to hack this and we talk about it we

590
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,159
work on it individually we work on

591
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,289
together and it's a great way to learn

592
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:57,289
how attackers get into applications so

593
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:58,519
grooming guidelines again when we're

594
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,959
talking about a new piece of work for

595
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:03,729
the team what we care about is

596
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:05,539
understanding all the details all the

597
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:07,279
things that can go wrong all the all the

598
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,619
work that needs to be accounted for so

599
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:12,289
at some point we need to say pen test

600
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:14,629
but we need to say standard tools are

601
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:17,479
okay so steady state operations I'm just

602
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,339
modifying something maybe that can go

603
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:20,899
through static analysis dynamic analysis

604
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,379
those kind of things automated tooling

605
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:25,459
sometimes I'm gonna want to look at the

606
00:23:25,459 --> 00:23:27,440
design I'm gonna want to have someone

607
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,019
with a security architecture background

608
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:32,389
look at the design or maybe it's

609
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:34,549
something where we're changing our

610
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:38,469
crypto if I'm doing that pen test please

611
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:42,200
so we'll give them this checklist for

612
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,389
stuff that's important and tell them

613
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,379
what to do about it

614
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:46,999
so that's how they start right we're

615
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,559
gonna start them with a very structured

616
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,149
rigid way of thinking about the world

617
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:52,369
give them those checklists and say if

618
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:55,729
this then that and then send them off

619
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:58,700
into the world there are things that

620
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,889
again that they can't be trusted with

621
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:02,119
because they just don't know what they

622
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:06,799
don't know so if it touches any of my

623
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,839
critical controls authorization

624
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,769
authentication crypto data validation

625
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:14,329
anything any kind of encoding either in

626
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,329
inputs or outputs those are the kind of

627
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:20,440
things where I need to make sure that

628
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,549
someone with a security background that

629
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:23,809
understands the kind of mistakes that

630
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,299
developers can make can can help with

631
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,429
that and those are the things where I

632
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:30,589
say hey you know this stuff needs pen

633
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:31,100
tester

634
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,450
needs a secure code review we're gonna

635
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,950
teach him how to do secure code reviews

636
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,630
so developers are very used to doing

637
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,669
peer code review so we'll look at it for

638
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:42,020
functionality we'll look at it for style

639
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,070
we'll look at it for good algorithms but

640
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,780
we need to teach them also how to look

641
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,660
at things around security but we're

642
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,799
gonna give them a very limited set of

643
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,830
topics to work with because again this

644
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,840
is a lot for them to learn and they need

645
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,130
to start slow and they will get better

646
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,720
over time we can add things to their

647
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,280
plate as they get more and more mature

648
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,830
in the organization so the kind of

649
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,030
things that we can talk to them about

650
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,549
our error handling and logging and an

651
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,950
input sanitization and those things to

652
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,990
make sure or output encoding is another

653
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,210
great one make sure that the developers

654
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,590
are doing the right things you can do

655
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,870
those spot checks so the the kind of

656
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,419
methodology is you have them shoulder

657
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,250
surf you doing a secure code review and

658
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,200
then you reverse now usual to serve them

659
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,650
and then you spot check them so give

660
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,659
them the training and give them the

661
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:33,230
know-how to do this stuff all right I

662
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,409
love this one

663
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,220
again they don't know what they don't

664
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,630
know they don't have the kind of

665
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,480
experience that we have so give them

666
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,330
goals but make them reasonable because

667
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,039
don't forget they also have day jobs

668
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:47,960
this is in addition to your current work

669
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,539
we need you to do this so it can't be

670
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:56,390
become a security expert this year when

671
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,429
we give them this power we need to make

672
00:25:58,429 --> 00:25:59,929
it a slow deliverable process where we

673
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,220
give them lots of training give them

674
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,500
lots of opportunities to fail in front

675
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,090
of us for learning opportunities and

676
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,510
then we can let them go and they need to

677
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,760
understand that when they get over their

678
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,590
skis they call us now that means if

679
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,630
we're the security guy and the phone

680
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,159
rings and I recognize the number is one

681
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,419
of my security champions that means you

682
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:20,030
pick it up whatever you're doing

683
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,159
they are your force multiplier right

684
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,289
they are your app sec army you need to

685
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,640
answer their phone call because they're

686
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,250
not calling you for nothing and if we

687
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,720
don't make them feel like they're being

688
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,640
supported then they're gonna start

689
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,230
ignoring their job responsibilities and

690
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,760
I'm not going to do a good job at this

691
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:38,710
so

692
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,169
for measurements we can give them some

693
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:42,730
certifications so we have built out a

694
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,320
little certification program around

695
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,899
doing security code reviews so there are

696
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,669
things planted in code we give it to

697
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,620
them we have them go look at it and then

698
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,820
they come back with their findings and

699
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,440
if they do a good job at those examples

700
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,179
we'll give them an internal

701
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,240
certification for that for the teams

702
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,909
think about a maturity model for app SEC

703
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:03,159
right so we start with ostrich with its

704
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,330
head in the ground where I don't know

705
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,250
anything about my application security I

706
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,210
get to a baseline where I know it's bad

707
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,610
to the next stage which is I am now

708
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,039
reacting to the scans so we scan

709
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,380
regularly I fix things we scan again I

710
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,169
fix things that doesn't fix the problem

711
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:23,169
that doesn't stop the bleeding in that

712
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,240
world you have to shift the development

713
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,770
left to give them the security tools to

714
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,000
do that while they're writing the code

715
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,309
which then becomes proactive which is

716
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:33,279
the next level in that maturity curve so

717
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:34,899
we we want to move them along that so we

718
00:27:34,899 --> 00:27:36,460
we take a look at the teams we put them

719
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,500
on a maturity scale and we try to help

720
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,480
them come up to that next level so

721
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,740
that's part of the goals for the years

722
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,630
moving them up to the next level towards

723
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,990
it at least and make sure you're clear

724
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,799
with your expectations clarity and in

725
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,260
measurement that is not arbitrary is

726
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,970
incredibly important to know whether

727
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,020
they are succeeding or not all right so

728
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,380
who doesn't like rewards so when we talk

729
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,760
about this we sometimes say hey let's

730
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,260
give them t-shirts or let's give them

731
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,880
special coffee mugs that have you know

732
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,950
security champions program at very code

733
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,899
for instance I have them attend

734
00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:16,450
conferences so I did a b-sides in in

735
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,230
Boston which is where I'm from we had

736
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,520
six of our security champions on the

737
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,279
audience it's a great way for them to go

738
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,110
out and train get to hear them talk

739
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,809
about tearing down hardware a pancake

740
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:30,370
maker and how to you know insert a new

741
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,529
stuff it's not about the pancake maker

742
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:34,000
it's about that process about that

743
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,700
process of ripping the thing apart to

744
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,200
understand how it works to put it back

745
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,850
together to do what you want it to do

746
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,490
which is what hackers do I love this

747
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,630
stuff

748
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,760
and they need to see it and when they

749
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,169
see it they start to understand they get

750
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:49,210
that edge because developers take a lot

751
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,260
of pride in their work and they don't

752
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,130
want it to be broken in that way

753
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,790
again the internal CTF exercises are a

754
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,270
lot of fun for them giving him swag so

755
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:05,130
like my suggestions before so for us we

756
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,600
have to learn about their world so has

757
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,830
anyone read the Phoenix project I have

758
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:14,610
three three four if you want to

759
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,960
understand how software is built today

760
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,000
if you want to understand DevOps

761
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,070
that is critical reading it's like a

762
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,590
weekend's worth of reading honestly it's

763
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,080
a story but it tells the story of how

764
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,080
software is built typically and how it

765
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,750
needs to get built in the future written

766
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,300
by Jean Kim the DevOps handbook is the

767
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,440
next one which is has individual section

768
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,000
on including one on security by the way

769
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,830
that goes more in depth as case studies

770
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,230
and and is an excellent excellent

771
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,990
resource you need to built those

772
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,520
relationships and you should attend some

773
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,560
of those ceremonies so in scrum there

774
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,150
are two role there are two types of

775
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,740
people in a meeting there are pigs and

776
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,810
there are chickens pigs are the people

777
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,610
to do the work right so they're your

778
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,530
developers they're your scrum master and

779
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,970
your product code they get to talk at

780
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,160
the meeting if you're a chicken which

781
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,560
means I'm visiting you don't get to talk

782
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,840
but you get to experience it so if

783
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,430
you're a security person and you have

784
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,290
developers doing work for which you

785
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,570
expect an outcome get to know how they

786
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,240
make the sausage go to their meetings

787
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,270
understand how they do their work and

788
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,140
start to influence them by speaking

789
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,830
their language so I swear to God if any

790
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,330
you walk out of here go to your to your

791
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,760
scrum master and say hey could I be a

792
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,080
chicken in here next grooming session

793
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,900
I'd be like you want to do what now who

794
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,680
it's like where did you learn those

795
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,310
words it's like the secret code now they

796
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,160
feel like you care you're trying to help

797
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,020
and not hurt right we're not there at

798
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,130
the end I want to be there at the

799
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,510
beginning I'm trying to understand this

800
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,190
stuff you start speaking their language

801
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,770
they're gonna invite you in and they'll

802
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:51,210
start your learning your lingo learning

803
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,670
their tools or let's say I want to write

804
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,350
some centralized function to do all

805
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,840
input validation and output encoding go

806
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,100
try to do that if you haven't written

807
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,780
code and released it for an enterprise

808
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,330
now hacking is one thing and and and you

809
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,650
know writing a little Arduino code which

810
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:04,960
I love

811
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,169
to do on the side is one thing but to

812
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:09,789
write something that gets vigorously

813
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:12,429
tested and security tested and released

814
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:15,399
is completely different so if you want

815
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:16,929
to experience that world and really

816
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,289
understand what developers face right

817
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:23,110
some security functions make them part

818
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,809
of the security process for your company

819
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:27,909
say hey if you use these input

820
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:30,149
validation routines and these encoders

821
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,309
it's on me to make them secure and it's

822
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,130
on me to make them work

823
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,260
now we allow everyone to get into our

824
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,120
security coding but we have a process

825
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,980
that we go and validate it but we've

826
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,720
done that we've had our security people

827
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,850
go right these libraries such that we

828
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,500
have one base of information and we

829
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,730
don't have to go out and look at

830
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:49,360
everything else

831
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,279
we know if they use the functions that

832
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,760
they're going to work properly all right

833
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,520
so in conclusion you need to customize

834
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,460
this to your own environment our work

835
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,990
environment is one thing yours is gonna

836
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,270
be another your culture is going to be

837
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,250
different you're gonna need to sell the

838
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,630
program you're gonna need to fail a

839
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,970
couple of times failure has to be okay

840
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,610
and then you pick it up and you fix it

841
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,260
and you look at it like I mean the the

842
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,330
example of pancake weaker again I

843
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,890
bricked the hardware I bricked my

844
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:19,990
security champion I have to go build

845
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,350
another one he's useless to me now doing

846
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,610
that over and over again and getting

847
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,049
better at it and getting those learnings

848
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,279
and then maybe coming up here and

849
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,710
talking to your peers about it about the

850
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,779
lessons that you learned in your company

851
00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:33,850
because my lessons and yours are going

852
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,760
to be different I have empathy for what

853
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,450
they do their work is hard - I've done

854
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,909
it for 25 years it is hard to do that

855
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,090
for an enterprise so have some empathy

856
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,289
around that and be able to speak their

857
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:49,210
language over communicate what you

858
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,460
expect and as I said before be

859
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,470
responsive if your security champion

860
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,820
calls you or one of your security

861
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,860
champions you have to pick up the phone

862
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,640
and make them feel like you care stay

863
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,289
engaged with your program even if it

864
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,090
starts to Peter off you got to put some

865
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,730
effort into it to get it back on track

866
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,110
it's incredibly important you know the

867
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,789
one thing that I'm speaking of more than

868
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,529
ever right now besides accountability is

869
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:14,200
at open source problem developers

870
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,880
integrate and abandon their software and

871
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,100
if you think about what a modern

872
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:18,730
software

873
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,640
which is in a microservice probably 95%

874
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,210
open-source code 5% of its my first

875
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,590
party code that glues all those

876
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,910
libraries together and makes them does

877
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,169
something to do something interesting

878
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:31,179
for my company so if you think about the

879
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:33,880
problem of having 95% of my stuff

880
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,860
integrated and then forgotten about and

881
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,140
I always go over that 5% that stuff

882
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,390
stays pretty secure hackers and I heard

883
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,270
this again today don't care about trying

884
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,559
to find the hard way if you leave the

885
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,470
doors open right if I can do a remote

886
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,000
code execution if I can just use a

887
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,620
botnet and go find all the people that

888
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,210
are using that vulnerable version of

889
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,880
struts then I'll go look at them and say

890
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,320
all right well that's interesting

891
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,210
I got a I got a hit here let me go look

892
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,850
deeper don't be that person

893
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,730
sweat the small stuff make sure that you

894
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,580
have that stuff taken care of

895
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,500
all right off my soapbox thank you very

896
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,489
much I will take questions

897
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:46,230
at some point and what you do is I been

898
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,360
there so I can tell you which tools when

899
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,070
you won't buy static analysis tools

900
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,290
which could find it better faster and

901
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,840
cheaper and earlier by the way there are

902
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,870
companies that building into the IDE so

903
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,520
all I'm typing code is almost like word

904
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,620
the spell checking and grammar checking

905
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,510
it says hold of sequel injection right

906
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,190
here look across site scripting right

907
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,650
there those things give you get caught

908
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,650
earlier and you can you cotton and run

909
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,740
regularly they run in minutes to maybe

910
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,630
an hour depending on how complex your

911
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,000
code is so you can flush all that stuff

912
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,550
out and think of it as so another key

913
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,060
term in a scrum team is the definition

914
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,520
of done so that is if I think I'm most

915
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,750
worried I'm going to do some work

916
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,360
there's some checklist that I need to go

917
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,130
through which means I write unit tests

918
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,320
for instance I have to write I have to

919
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,970
run static analysis and I have to clean

920
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:38,130
those results and our company we have

921
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,390
zero tolerance for any new

922
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,740
vulnerabilities getting into our source

923
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,270
code base so you can find those things

924
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,370
earlier and better with tools that

925
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,320
integrated for instance Jenkins so you

926
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,080
do you see I build and do assurance

927
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:57,600
testing there but also like I said I

928
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,040
have a good program it talks about that

929
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,560
shift left about using those tools to do

930
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,180
the right things and using remember I

931
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,100
said not everything gets pen testers I

932
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,690
only want to do that for the stuff that

933
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,590
really matters I care a lot that gets

934
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,410
done right right it's like they didn't

935
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,750
use an input validation routine but the

936
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,880
software will find that for you and fix

937
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,380
that and they can fix that before they

938
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,810
go it just use pen testing for the

939
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,680
really important stuff because you're

940
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,020
right it's expensive and by the way when

941
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,690
I'm releasing 10 times a day it doesn't

942
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,960
scale I measure pen tests and calendars

943
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,650
right not in minutes

944
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:48,140
so only a couple maybe a couple of teams

945
00:36:48,140 --> 00:37:01,350
how many teams so the investments

946
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,540
worthwhile so I would argue that you

947
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,030
always want to have this again as a

948
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,680
close that person you can't be at every

949
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,090
meeting so you need to pick that a few

950
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,280
teams so having those champions

951
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,660
available to you no matter how many

952
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,510
teams you have I this works at companies

953
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,050
that have hundreds of teams as well

954
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,490
there's a little bit of modeling around

955
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,070
how you manage that program or building

956
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,340
it is it pretty much the same so I think

957
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:41,360
it I think it's always worth feather

958
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,350
yes

959
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:08,630
so the the question was there's a high

960
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,819
turnover rate of my developers what do I

961
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:12,019
do about that seems like I'm always

962
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:13,940
gonna be training it's like well what's

963
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,289
the alternative

964
00:38:15,289 --> 00:38:18,259
honestly like I said I hate most factors

965
00:38:18,259 --> 00:38:20,779
of lung so I have to on every team and

966
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:22,670
when that first one leaves I can start

967
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,039
trading another one or they can appear

968
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,349
trade each other so when your program

969
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:29,539
gets more and more mature you might

970
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:30,979
designate some people that have been

971
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,239
with the company like I've been with my

972
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:35,029
company for 12 years so I might be a

973
00:38:35,029 --> 00:38:36,769
good candidate to start mentoring and

974
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:39,289
doing that first level training because

975
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:41,989
I've been doing it so long to build out

976
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:45,109
that an ecosystem so you can get a

977
00:38:45,109 --> 00:38:47,059
deeper bench if you want to but really

978
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:50,299
there is no other alternative than to

979
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:54,170
keep training because developers so for

980
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,969
my software developers anyone take like

981
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:57,890
secure coding courses in college I know

982
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,900
when I went to school there weren't any

983
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,539
is it required for your degree

984
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,299
no no so it's not required so unless you

985
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:06,829
have some kind of serious thing where

986
00:39:06,829 --> 00:39:08,210
it's like that's the H I want to scratch

987
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,339
you gonna take it so you don't get

988
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:12,739
trained and now I got a trainee most of

989
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:14,479
the workforce around the world is

990
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,099
exactly the same they're not trained in

991
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:18,650
this stuff we need to train them and yes

992
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:21,819
it's a constant effort

993
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:17,670
okay so if I've captured the question

994
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,329
correctly it's the echo system small I

995
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:23,220
may not be able to bring them what if I

996
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,650
outsource this will be the different

997
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,980
model to go after this thing so I guess

998
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,349
the next questions I would ask you is do

999
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:33,299
you have money to outsource these people

1000
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:34,799
because it's actually cheaper to buy

1001
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:48,809
them and have them work on your team so

1002
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:51,869
so shared resource pause yeah yeah so

1003
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:57,450
look this is all get smacked in the face

1004
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,609
as soon as you meet the enemy have any

1005
00:40:59,609 --> 00:41:01,680
calls mark so your company may be

1006
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,420
different and maybe New Zealand is

1007
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,839
different if you have to share maybe

1008
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,910
that's maybe that's an okay model again

1009
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,460
the problem is that you have multiple

1010
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,839
things over the life of a piece of

1011
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,760
software from what I'm talking about the

1012
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,309
idea to I've designed it coding on it

1013
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:22,020
across those facets you have a team of

1014
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,339
people that sit together and talk about

1015
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:26,279
it every day what you really want is to

1016
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:27,839
have that baked into the team now if you

1017
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,849
can't and make you only attend certain

1018
00:41:29,849 --> 00:41:31,289
ceremonies then you have to take a look

1019
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,119
at trying to coordinate schedules so

1020
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,339
this resource is available or you need

1021
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:36,930
to have multiple events to cover these

1022
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,240
these various meetings to make sure that

1023
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,430
they're in the room but also that

1024
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,410
learning doesn't necessarily take place

1025
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,119
most use it might be a good way to scale

1026
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,910
up a team again your your mileage may

1027
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:50,010
vary there are multiple ways to get from

1028
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,390
A to B what I believe is that the dev

1029
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,829
ops team needs to be fully

1030
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:57,690
cross-functional and really agile teams

1031
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,160
want to be the same way I need to have

1032
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,869
all the people in the room because I

1033
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:04,170
can't afford to share if you think about

1034
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,789
how companies want to release software

1035
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,829
very quickly the fastest model is to do

1036
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:10,529
no handoffs at all so if I'm a developer

1037
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,359
I got a longer talk on this as well

1038
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:13,920
called full spectrum engineer where you

1039
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,160
say

1040
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:19,890
because I'm good at dua and now I'm

1041
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,749
gonna start to get a really weird stuff

1042
00:42:21,749 --> 00:42:24,029
like I'm gonna do a security testing by

1043
00:42:24,029 --> 00:42:25,680
the way I'm doing containers so I'm

1044
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,180
thinking operating systems an open

1045
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,529
source software and terraforming

1046
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,660
environments in the cloud all of those

1047
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,130
things that we were never trained to do

1048
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,410
as engineers and now I need to pick up

1049
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:37,259
those skills because like they said the

1050
00:42:37,259 --> 00:42:38,789
fastest way is for me not to hand it off

1051
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,380
to anybody so I start to grow those

1052
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,720
skills as a byproduct of doing that to

1053
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,039
work on those DevOps teams to really

1054
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:45,630
move fast to do that single piece flow

1055
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,210
one idea one developer checked in out

1056
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,069
the door and then the next piece of work

1057
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:52,289
comes - that's how we get to multiple

1058
00:42:52,289 --> 00:42:55,200
releases a day by a whole team to work

1059
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,769
on one person doing work yes sir you are

1060
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:05,779
allowed to have I'm happy to be wrong

1061
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,750
and it might be something where you zero

1062
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,810
to grow a certification program you know

1063
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,460
maybe there's a way to do that where you

1064
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,110
can actually pay to get certified as a

1065
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,150
security champion and there's certain

1066
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,890
things that are specific to your company

1067
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:36,720
or specific to your team but in general

1068
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,340
that that kind of security awareness is

1069
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,290
something that we could build a navy at

1070
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,700
these sites conference or something else

1071
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,160
where they didn't bring in if you get a

1072
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,450
discounted ticket if you bring a

1073
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,770
developer with you to your visa as

1074
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:49,860
conferences and the developer gets in

1075
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,080
three because we're gonna train me

1076
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,550
really it's a it's all spreading the

1077
00:43:53,550 --> 00:44:01,430
information I see almost anybody else

1078
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,330
all right thank you very much for your

1079
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:04,110
time today

1080
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:11,719
[Applause]
