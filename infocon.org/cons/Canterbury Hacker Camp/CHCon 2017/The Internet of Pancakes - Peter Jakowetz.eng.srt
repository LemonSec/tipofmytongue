1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,639
g'day my name's Peter jackets I'm a

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,089
security consultant from Wellington wit

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:08,460
from quantum security I've got a kind of

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,719
background in electrical engineering

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,809
I studied elite down here in Canterbury

6
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,960
I really enjoy kind of breaking things

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,100
it's kind of mostly my spare time doing

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,949
and my hobbies are like playing with old

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,100
cars playing with my cat and playing

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,300
about cheap electronics so about six

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,699
months ago I was just searching TradeMe

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:30,029
as I do

13
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,740
trying to find a CNC machine so I could

14
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,140
do some woodwork and I stumbled across a

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,030
pancake maker and I'd seen them a couple

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,739
years ago on Kickstarter on me that's

17
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:38,340
pretty cool

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,500
and so suppose I want to trade me when I

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,530
must have this so I purchased it and

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:44,789
then decided that I've got to go and

21
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,320
play around with it and break it so

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,090
today we have a bit of a chat about what

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,879
the pancake bot is how it used to work

24
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,309
what I've done to it since how it works

25
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,219
or doesn't work now and what I still

26
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,449
plan to do in the future

27
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:11,250
cool so what is the pancake bot in 2015

28
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,900
a dude went and made a since epen cake

29
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,420
machine out of Lego and like Lego

30
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,189
robotics and he threw it over the

31
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,689
engineer and people went that's pretty

32
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:22,140
cool

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,090
so he then decided to throw it up on

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,759
Kickstarter and he got a couple hundred

35
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:29,159
grand worth of them backing towards it

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,380
and so he actually made it into like a

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,939
real thing so there are about 250 bucks

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,880
when they were new and a sink boiling

39
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,860
down it's a robot that makes custom

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,280
pancakes it's a two axis CNC machine and

41
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,509
you go and create a design a little bit

42
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,460
of software that they have made

43
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,360
shove it onto an SD card plug the SD

44
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,219
card into the printer and profit it's

45
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,659
currently in version 2 of its hardware

46
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,250
I'm not entirely sure what the actual

47
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,680
differences were between 1 & 2

48
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,788
I broke a version one and it comes with

49
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,220
the others pancake painter software for

50
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,170
creating designs I decided that it was

51
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:13,590
kind of

52
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,230
good enough so I never really um tried

53
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,150
to replace that so what is CNC you might

54
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,970
ask CNC is computer numerical control

55
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,310
it's been around since about the 50s and

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,920
it was essentially because it was

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,069
boarding around big machining and stuff

58
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,120
instead of having to have people

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,550
standing behind lathes and Mills all day

60
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,170
going and making the same thing over and

61
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,120
over again they decide to start

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,470
automating there so that you could

63
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:43,739
instead feed some code into a machine

64
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,000
and it goes and reproduces the same

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,720
thing many times it's primarily used in

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,040
manufacturing but it's becoming more and

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,260
more popular kind of for home and

68
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,739
hobbyists the most common thing I guess

69
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,400
would be 3d printers but it's used on

70
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,410
things like laser cutters or laser

71
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,780
cutters water jet cutters lathes Mills

72
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,819
3d printers are all different types of

73
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,569
CNC machines so the pancake bot works so

74
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:15,030
in the software you can go on like

75
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,940
import images and it then goes and

76
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,609
creates those into like a vectorized

77
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,829
format so rather than being rasterized

78
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,230
and being lots of little dots it tries

79
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,489
to kind of makes the designs out of

80
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:29,250
lines and steve and it puts that into

81
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,799
the software and then with all those

82
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:32,340
lines

83
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,010
it creates g-code out of that which is

84
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,150
um what the CNC machines understand so

85
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,829
this is an example of the G code for

86
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,650
that previous slide so for like a pretty

87
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,870
what is a pretty simple kind of design

88
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,910
there's like seventeen hundred lines of

89
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,620
code and as as you can see it's mostly

90
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,940
all the same it's just getting

91
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,500
coordinates on a XY plane so what is G

92
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,389
code it's are the instructions see at

93
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:08,400
first CNC machines it's pretty much just

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,370
a big flat text file

95
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,799
Arius true seven four and it's been

96
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,090
around since the 50s as well kind of

97
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,858
since some scene seeing started becoming

98
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,339
a thing there's kind of three major

99
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,080
types of um prefixes for codes of this G

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,139
which is address where it commands

101
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,569
in for miscellaneous function so turning

102
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,479
pumps on and off motors on and off you

103
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:35,460
can query the machine for like the

104
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,460
status of different things and then

105
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,379
you've also got XY and Z positions which

106
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:45,110
is most of what was in that last slide

107
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:49,560
so as part of kind of playing around

108
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,389
with this machine I win and pumped out a

109
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,099
bunch of code and tried to figure out

110
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:54,840
all the different commands that were

111
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,069
possible and what it uses so just to

112
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,099
kind of run through them quickly the W

113
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:05,090
command define the workspace of a file

114
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,150
you can G 21 six things to millimeters

115
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,550
you can set positions to travel things

116
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,479
to the interesting one there's probably

117
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,689
the motor on and off which is in 106 I'm

118
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,879
in 107 and in the case of the pancake

119
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,430
maker that goes and turns a pump on and

120
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,860
off to go and blue pancake mix over the

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,969
um over the hot plate so this is an

122
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,219
example of that g code from before being

123
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:37,430
printed

124
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,110
so there's a few different there's a

125
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,919
whole bunch of different settings that

126
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,770
you can see it and it's a whole bunch of

127
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,940
variables as well when you're kind of

128
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,039
printing with the in this case the

129
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,360
mixture was probably a bit too thick and

130
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,410
the pressure wasn't probably up high

131
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,220
enough and that's why it's doing the

132
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,030
weird squiggly thing but um it kind of

133
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,970
means every time you print as to how

134
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:11,180
well those things happen when you're

135
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,979
sitting up a print as well you can kind

136
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,419
of set things in multiple layers so that

137
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:15,650
you can get our different colors on the

138
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,940
imprint so in the software you kind of

139
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,009
see it like four different colors and

140
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,650
all do the the darkest color first wait

141
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,900
like 30 or 45 seconds from the next

142
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,970
layer let that heat up a bit and brown

143
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,270
off and keep going and then you get

144
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,919
something like that so it's pretty cool

145
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,580
so they may need to start breaking it so

146
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,270
kind of a to about the first day I

147
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,620
bought it I just added ripping into it

148
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,800
and wanting to see what was inside so

149
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,229
the whole thing is kind of powered by a

150
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:50,180
mega 2560 microcontroller

151
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,510
which is a pretty common micro it's used

152
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,449
in Arduino and the Arduino mega 2560 in

153
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,190
fact the big board on the right is the

154
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,530
controller board and it's got like an SD

155
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,090
card support and it's got like a little

156
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,820
LCD as well there's a really chunky

157
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,699
12-volt power supply in there there's a

158
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,169
couple of just um cheap NEMA stepper

159
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:16,190
motors an ear and vacuum pump which is

160
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,630
the pump that us talked about before and

161
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,669
then two micro valves so one of those

162
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,620
valves makes the pump suck and one of

163
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:28,310
them makes it um push stuff out I think

164
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,360
I don't want to know what coab is

165
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,500
running on this just to see if I could

166
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,659
use the existing hardware to go and um

167
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:35,570
throw new code on and found out that it

168
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,860
was all open sourced which was pretty

169
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,500
cool so they throw it all up online the

170
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,820
firmware is based on something called

171
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,229
marlin which is used for a lot of 3d

172
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:46,580
printing it was created for like the

173
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,800
riprap 3d printers except they went to

174
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
modified a bunch of their and they

175
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,830
didn't comment or anything so yeah she

176
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,240
had no idea what that done to it

177
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,210
so I had to find an original version of

178
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,770
that diff between the two to try and

179
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,569
find the differences and then guess why

180
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,740
that actually put those differences in

181
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,870
they also don't they've got a firmware

182
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,370
upgrade process that wasn't particularly

183
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,470
intuitive rather than just flashing it

184
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,530
using like the arduino ide which is

185
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,310
probably the most common way to get

186
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,160
stuff on to what's essentially add we

187
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,460
know it was like a bin file to go and

188
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,479
drop on there there is a USB port that

189
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,069
was on the device except you could only

190
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:29,780
use it to do firmware updates and

191
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,000
they're disabled it for the printing I'd

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,380
flicked a message to the guy who

193
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,870
actually designed it in the states and

194
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,500
he couldn't tell me why it was disabled

195
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,740
and he didn't know how to change it so

196
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,000
the pros of this original design was

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,279
that it was tidy and small it was pretty

198
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,570
well supported I've got a good website

199
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,420
with a bunch of um help on it it makes

200
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,800
custom designs easily and it actually

201
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,790
works the downside

202
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,500
you've got to like the main downside was

203
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,370
that you could have go and plug a nice

204
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,860
tea Carden and that's no fun I want to

205
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,480
be able to lie in bed and see it prints

206
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,529
off and yeah and be able to automate

207
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,529
things a bit more and to be honest it

208
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:10,730
wasn't really complicated enough and it

209
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,700
actually worked so what does it look

210
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,040
like at the moment it looks a little bit

211
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,970
like that part of the reason for me

212
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,290
having to do a lot of the work that I've

213
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,850
done is because I tried to go and update

214
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,920
the firmware pretty early on and I kind

215
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,209
of bricked it

216
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:33,470
I still don't entirely know why but the

217
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,170
USB has got no serial connection now so

218
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,370
what it was I just ripped out all the

219
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,079
original hardware I left it with the

220
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,940
skipper motors Clair didn't really wanna

221
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,070
have to have gone buy new ones and I

222
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,360
bought a second unit just so that when I

223
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,760
broke this further I had something to

224
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,709
keep fall back on so the current state

225
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,720
so as I see before it's pretty much the

226
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,410
original actual physical structure and

227
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,160
the motors I've then got an Arduino mega

228
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,440
2560 with um something called a ramps

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,029
port on top and that's like a really

230
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:09,810
common 3d printing 3d printing component

231
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,259
they're like a couple bucks from China

232
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:15,209
then plugs into a large little Raspberry

233
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:18,379
Pi and it's also got a webcam on it

234
00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:21,660
plugs into a wireless router and then I

235
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,430
have a song off like wireless relay that

236
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,069
goes and controls the hot plates that I

237
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:33,839
can turn that on and off wirelessly so

238
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,129
now rather than having to touch with SD

239
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:36,839
card I can navigate to like a web UI

240
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,019
upload some G code from the pancake I

241
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,939
can't get message between a prince and

242
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:46,110
their prophet so this is like the RAM

243
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,899
support that I was talking about there's

244
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,189
not too much to it once I kind of

245
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:54,209
figured out what the original hardware

246
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:55,589
actually did by I'm having a look at

247
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,769
those decode commands from before I

248
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,790
figured all they she needed to do was

249
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,029
throw some ins Dopson which is the box

250
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:07,079
on the top right plug some motor drivers

251
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,360
and the motor cables which is the X&Y in

252
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,550
the middle D nine on the top left is the

253
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,129
pump on and off and then there's just

254
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:19,170
12-volt end on the bottom left so it was

255
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,519
pretty simple all in all and you know I

256
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,139
had to go and throw some firmware on the

257
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,319
Arduino so I've gone and use the same

258
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:30,319
Marlin firmware that was in the original

259
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:32,430
except they were using quite an old

260
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,350
version version one which had been

261
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,240
around quite a few years so I've

262
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
upgraded it to the one point one it's

263
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,589
all written in C it's pretty well

264
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:42,839
abstracted so you've only got to really

265
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:43,889
play around with a couple of the files

266
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,559
there's like a config and a config

267
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,620
advanced and it's pretty much just a

268
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,930
case of going through a couple thousand

269
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,790
lines of code that's really well

270
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,370
commented though and just um changing

271
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,959
the handful of relevant bits

272
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,639
Marlon's yeah it's used for lots of 3d

273
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,529
printers that's used for some laser

274
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,800
cutters and like home CNC machines it's

275
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,230
got about 150 commands in it so it's

276
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,209
really fully featured and there's a mess

277
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,240
of support community around it which I

278
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,740
kind of found beneficial and then really

279
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,990
terrible as well like most open-source

280
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,759
software you've got people who know a

281
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,620
lot about it and are really passionate

282
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,490
on the forums and

283
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,630
stuff and then you've got lots of morons

284
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,790
that I'm trying to tell you things that

285
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,290
don't really actually help and just

286
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,130
break things further so now I've got a

287
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,930
Raspberry Pi workers by that web server

288
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,480
and to interface with it

289
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,850
so it's using something called octo pi I

290
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,230
was gonna do like at my own weave

291
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,500
fronting for it and then I realized octo

292
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,959
pyoko / n already existed so some sort

293
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,660
of dumb hard work and essentially all

294
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,890
that as this yes like a web fronting for

295
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:50,520
it

296
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,779
you can upload G code to it and from

297
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:59,130
there you can also control both X Y Z to

298
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,200
access on the printer

299
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,290
it's got we became support so you can

300
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,490
have a webcam on it and I could do like

301
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,080
time-lapse is your prints cuz that's

302
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,279
really necessary and you can do things

303
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,920
like send messages to select channels

304
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,050
it's got an API so if I actually ended

305
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,820
up throwing it on the internet not just

306
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,000
the LAN I could do some more cool stuff

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,140
with that as well well as debugging it

308
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,610
was just like a really lightweight but a

309
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,250
soft we called um pronterface or print

310
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,740
run and I used that a lot just for like

311
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,110
testing that things were working as I

312
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,360
kind of expected so I ripped most the

313
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,980
hardware out of the main unit and I had

314
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,079
it on my desk and um all plugged up and

315
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,040
then just using this was a lot easier

316
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,770
than having to battle with the issues of

317
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:47,190
like the web interface screwing up as

318
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,350
well to control the hot plate I've got a

319
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,510
Wi-Fi relay in there I'd bought these to

320
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,570
control some of the lights around a flat

321
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,800
and they're like super cheap from China

322
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,290
they like less than five bucks they can

323
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,240
switch ten amps which is pretty cool and

324
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,209
the they can be reflash with new and

325
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,490
firmware as well so you can use them for

326
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,860
like the things like open home whatever

327
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,899
the Apple standard is for um kind of

328
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,970
smart devices so the end this is the

329
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,529
mess of the desk trying to make this

330
00:14:19,529 --> 00:14:23,910
thing work so in the kind of top right

331
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,190
corner there's just like a little um

332
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,589
Wi-Fi access point the rents borden the

333
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:30,209
Arduino is the bottom right it's all

334
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,610
about the Raspberry Pi the power supply

335
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,430
and then a couple of those relays it was

336
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,180
good though because there's like a whole

337
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,279
kind of box section around the whole

338
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,130
thing that I could like hide stuff in

339
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:50,270
and now it looks kind of tidy so the

340
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,149
design process is kind of when I figured

341
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,899
out what all the original stuff did

342
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:58,730
broke it all apart tried to figure out

343
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,430
how I could replace that with our open

344
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,410
source components and open source stuff

345
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,190
that existed tracked back every wire

346
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,649
loom and drew lots of diagrams so

347
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:10,940
there's a couple of wiring looms that

348
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,320
aren't just one-to-one that go through

349
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,270
it so it just means sitting down there

350
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,399
with a multimeter for a couple hours

351
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,709
panning out every single cable ripped

352
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,380
out all the old stuff through some

353
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,279
firmware on the Arduino and keeps

354
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,899
testing and breaking things what are the

355
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,459
kind of cost all up like the pan cables

356
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,350
a couple hundred bucks raspberry PI's

357
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,870
are pretty cheap loose in 50 bucks

358
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,029
the Wi-Fi things maybe like 10 bucks so

359
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:39,680
all in all like the whole thing kind of

360
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,209
came in maybe for like 300 bucks which

361
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:48,320
is pretty cool for like a CNC robot sort

362
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,250
of may be interesting just to kind of

363
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,779
show like where I buy the stuff from so

364
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:51,680
Alex bristles Ruggie

365
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,150
pretty edgy everything from because it's

366
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,270
cheap airs it's pretty reliable and it

367
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,560
just takes as long as you're prepared

368
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,660
enough to wait a month it's all good

369
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,950
trade means at least kind of three or

370
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,900
four times the price and Alec tronic

371
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,550
shops are like five times the price but

372
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,730
you can't get it instantly so things I

373
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,140
want to do in the future with this is

374
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,880
kind of customized the web UI a bit

375
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,950
further I really like the idea of doing

376
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,630
some like cool kind of like spire graphs

377
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,160
and designs and stuff so doing like some

378
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,569
mathematical kind of designs

379
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,339
there's functionality in through the G

380
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:32,810
code to our temperature sensors as well

381
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,450
and to report that back so that would be

382
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,040
cool to kind of know what temperature

383
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,589
the hot plate was up to do pressure

384
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:41,779
sensors as well as you know how much

385
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:43,010
pressure is happening and you can change

386
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,570
that and like doing like a self filling

387
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,339
pancake better receptacle so then you

388
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,080
didn't have to keep filling it up

389
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,040
cool so I would love to do a

390
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,110
demonstration to you guys but the demo

391
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,570
gods were really bad to me and

392
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,150
everything kind of broke last night

393
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,290
which is kind of the general theme of

394
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,349
while I was working on this so

395
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,400
throughout the whole time like I just

396
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,900
keep blowing stuff up so I've been

397
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,190
through kind of two or three Arduino is

398
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,640
a bunch of ramps boards a whole bunch of

399
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,940
motor drivers I somehow couldn't you Ste

400
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,260
card I don't even didn't know that was

401
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,480
possible

402
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,560
and part of the reason for that so I

403
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,790
never quite got around to putting a fan

404
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,280
in it so the motor drivers kept over

405
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,020
heating when I keep driving them there's

406
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,210
like lots of variables making pancakes

407
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:34,220
apparently so kind of going away from

408
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,890
the more technology side like actually

409
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,150
trying to make a consistent pancake

410
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,310
better so that things are repeatable it

411
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,040
was really difficult also like the heat

412
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,930
of doing different types of mixtures

413
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,050
changes the pressures and the time for

414
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,000
cooking and stuff like you got to take a

415
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,920
few a few things into account to try and

416
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,450
do things without sitting right beside

417
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,610
it like hardware's hard reverse

418
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,950
engineering is hard you just keep I

419
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,170
think there's just an expectation that

420
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,390
you just gonna keep breaking stuff which

421
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,890
just happens and that's great and that's

422
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,240
the kind of fun of it I found it's a lot

423
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,080
of the components were quite

424
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,630
inconsistent

425
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,430
you could have three things come out of

426
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,350
the same packet and one of them might

427
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,480
work one of them might be way over

428
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,910
speaker and one might be under Specht

429
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:24,620
and i also don't really like pancakes my

430
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,060
girlfriend's had a hold on a pancakes in

431
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:31,820
the last couple months so some useful

432
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,990
applications things I think I might use

433
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,570
this for in the future like putting some

434
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,790
other things into it like chocolate

435
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,310
maybe like you print wax maybe and make

436
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:43,310
like candles or something I was

437
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,220
searching the net just for some ideas of

438
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,180
things that other people were done with

439
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,920
it and here's some doing geeks aren't

440
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,210
asking if you can print head gaskets

441
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:50,660
with it

442
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,800
which I don't think would be

443
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,690
particularly good but like you know it

444
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,130
might work

445
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,680
I found a sweet video of a guy laser

446
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,310
cutting

447
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,980
Vin Diesel bust out of our ham and

448
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,370
cheese so I were going to be quite fun

449
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,999
to follow that

450
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:08,239
like a pancake printed vin diesel and

451
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:10,249
they're probably more on the useful side

452
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,439
teaching kids about scene see I wrote a

453
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:13,489
couple nieces that I'm trying to get

454
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:15,199
into like electronics and hardware and

455
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,749
stuff so I'm that probably gonna end up

456
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:19,639
with uh one of my pancake makers at the

457
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,079
end of all this

458
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,569
it's just a cool it's much more fun

459
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:24,589
being able to like play with something

460
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:25,849
that you can then eat the outcome of

461
00:19:25,849 --> 00:19:27,709
rather than having just to like play

462
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,379
around with 3d printers and get little

463
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:34,609
knickknacks to leave on your desk and

464
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:36,049
one of the reasons actually started this

465
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,019
as well is that I wouldn't border my

466
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,219
whole love of cheap Chinese electronics

467
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,949
I bought a really cheap crappy laser

468
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:43,939
cutter

469
00:19:43,939 --> 00:19:47,089
I got a stick in hand from some dude who

470
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,589
had already blown up the controller in

471
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:53,389
it but yeah like the k4d lasers the

472
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:54,919
really cheap out of China but they are

473
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:57,409
terrible and they've got a terrible

474
00:19:57,409 --> 00:19:59,089
software on them but the actual like

475
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,409
physical components of them are pretty

476
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,759
good like the laser tubes are absolutely

477
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:04,519
fine and the actual housing is fine and

478
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,069
the power supplies are okay

479
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:09,019
so that's actually getting pretty much

480
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:10,999
the same conversion is what the pancake

481
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:15,249
bot got with a ramps board and Arduino

482
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:17,299
it's really cheap to do because it's

483
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,499
like less than 50 bucks to do the

484
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:21,019
conversion and it's probably safer than

485
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,759
the original hardware that was pretty

486
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:27,889
rubbish these images aren't very good

487
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:29,119
but that's like the original software

488
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:31,279
for the laser cutter and it's your only

489
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,299
bit of software that you can use to

490
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:35,319
drive it and it's the English version

491
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,519
there's about three words of English on

492
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,609
the entire page they're just pretty

493
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:44,059
pants so that's some of the conversion

494
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,399
that I've done already and I've got a

495
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:53,059
couple seconds so this is the octo print

496
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:55,879
software so I've got the pancake bought

497
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,139
at the back at the moment

498
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:05,019
and I will I know okay

499
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:15,720
if this works that will be cool

500
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,100
cool see if I can turn on the hot plate

501
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,270
that might be

502
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:43,570
not wanting to play ball yay um cool so

503
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,610
the hot plates are now and

504
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,380
wait so if I go spin on that should so I

505
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,140
kind of blow up the y-axis this morning

506
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,430
so only like the x-axis goes which is

507
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:11,350
unfortunate we'll see if this works very

508
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:16,140
well so I'm just looking the pump go ah

509
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,520
sorry so the pump currently is like

510
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,060
sucking up the mixture so when I do this

511
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:28,800
it should start spilling out and if I do

512
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,800
that

513
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:52,910
yay so yeah if I hadn't ever had a

514
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,770
y-axis working this would be like a lot

515
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,470
more impressive I should probably turn

516
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:08,860
that stop spilling stuff on there maybe

517
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,820
yeah so essentially you can just like

518
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:19,340
upload g-code onto here I can go down

519
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,020
the page further yes you can just drag

520
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,280
and drop bomb Jenko files in here and

521
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,870
then push the print and it just goes for

522
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:33,200
gold there's also like you can just go

523
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,570
and send it commands so

524
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,500
like we can go in one-one-nine which

525
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,400
should now tell me the status of all my

526
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:58,600
in stops or it might have decided to

527
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:06,220
stop responding which it has yeah and

528
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,990
yeah just the sort of module is pretty

529
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,630
basic it's just a toggle one-off kind of

530
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:13,390
thing I'm planning on kind of doing a

531
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,980
bit more on this and integrating it more

532
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,930
with the web UI so that I don't have to

533
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:26,190
go between two things and if I can

534
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,300
cool so I've got to throw a my code up

535
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,970
on github it's not quite the latest

536
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,460
version at the moment but yeah if you

537
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,480
want to know anything have a gaze at

538
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,700
that took me some Twitter or feel free

539
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,810
to pop out the back later and have a

540
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,420
look at what I've done it probably looks

541
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,740
more impressive in person than it does

542
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,340
on this that's kind of fun yeah any

543
00:24:51,340 --> 00:25:14,140
questions yep sorry Oh Jill extruding

544
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,060
pancake maker that sounds like it that

545
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,710
sounds like the next iteration of the

546
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,070
say that's awesome thanks for the idea

547
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:42,130
yeah it might be a bit just yeah yeah

548
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,690
but it's all of the desires I just like

549
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,620
drove it a hold of the tall

550
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:28,329
[Applause]
