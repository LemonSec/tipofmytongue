1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,630
[Applause]

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:13,049
votre monde je m'appelle soya a llama

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:18,270
as I cannot speak French I give a

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:24,119
presentation in English in fact I'd like

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:28,609
to use Japanese okay today's

6
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,349
presentation is an inconvenient truth

7
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:34,070
building the loss of ear protection in

8
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,070
Windows 10

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,020
very happy to give our presentation here

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,840
first let me introduce myself I'm

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,919
security researcher at judicial system

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,690
integration laboratories Limited and

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,690
organizer at besides Tokyo

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,650
I've been working for food it's more

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,840
than 20 years at Windows software

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:11,720
developer I wrote a nice driver Brutus

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,720
profile we soak application and more

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:22,539
security research about four years ago

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,390
my first presentation was at every Tokyo

20
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:30,340
it's one of the most famous security

21
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:33,570
conference in Japan and the motto it's

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,740
no drink no hug

23
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,169
so I gave a presentation while drinking

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:45,080
to be honest I'd like to do the same

25
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,080
today but I refrain from it

26
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:53,210
and this is my research history about

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:58,340
local hacking

28
00:01:53,210 --> 00:02:00,630
in 2016 I was researching about jabbsi

29
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,680
yet

30
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:09,690
at that time I found way to escalate

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:13,230
privilege to administrator so in 2017

32
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,680
I'll give a presentation at besides Las

33
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,679
Vegas

34
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:23,240
last year I found way to abating the

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:29,300
ransomware protection and give a

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:33,850
presentation at work on track on Derby

37
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,850
Kong and Hawk Miami

38
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:44,200
this year I found new issue summit CFP

39
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:49,050
and I am here

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:54,339
however I cannot talk about this issue

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:59,280
because it's not fixed I'm looking for

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,280
to meeting you next year

43
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:13,510
next I'd like to talk a little about way

44
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:13,510
to escalate privilege to administrator

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:23,360
it all started when I execute the coke

46
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:27,040
management launcher

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,040
it's learning with high integrity level

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,040
and

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:37,270
is loading through extension x64 dot da

50
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,500
unbelievably its salt party dear

51
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:54,859
management rancha does not display the

52
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,770
you se screen and execute with

53
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,770
administrator privileges

54
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:03,410
which means

55
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:07,990
it's us pipers

56
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:10,990
and Lord third-party da in Program Files

57
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,990
order

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,590
but prophecies can access program files

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,590
folder

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,970
about explora

61
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,889
so I such the explora

62
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,110
Rhoda is loading one drives the area

63
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,100
unbelievably it's in the users for them

64
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:51,919
explora Lord Guan drive the air in users

65
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:57,919
folder and can access it accesses

66
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,919
Program Files folder which means

67
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,830
I found a way to get administrator

68
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,830
privileges

69
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:15,240
my basic concept is that we press the

70
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:15,240
collect deal with Mises one

71
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,270
however if exe chords a function

72
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,779
as virile does not know it

73
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:33,849
so I thought that Magisterial should

74
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,330
pass through the function to the correct

75
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,330
da

76
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:46,189
the following in the implementation

77
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:51,889
necessary to rewrite the concept

78
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:55,460
load the correct DLL and get its handle

79
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:57,559
get address of each function using

80
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,979
handle

81
00:05:57,559 --> 00:06:03,589
when code from Exe called the

82
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:06,339
corresponding function with the correct

83
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:06,339
admins

84
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,130
but Punk's on the DL a half

85
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:20,688
it using the damping command

86
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:31,400
Pyrus inks a fix for dot d Earhart's for

87
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,400
export functions

88
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:44,690
dear can unload now DL get class object

89
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:49,780
DL register Sabah DL and register Sabah

90
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,780
and one text test function

91
00:06:51,420 --> 00:07:01,430
and said extension x64 DL has same for

92
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,430
export function

93
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,200
so only need to implement or export

94
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,210
functions

95
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,210
and it's very easy

96
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:22,539
because the export file

97
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:22,539
so API described or Microsoft website

98
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:33,970
oh this is the source code but Marsha

99
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,969
Scott has been removed

100
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:43,669
then I explained detail mechanism

101
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:53,810
when user executes mashes program

102
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:57,560
for example by targets email attack was

103
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,560
watering hole attack

104
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,919
my sass program dname product the air

105
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,450
and copies it self

106
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,340
you

107
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,260
when the system listed

108
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,210
Xtra de los mochis da

109
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,239
you

110
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:49,189
it's same process but this time need

111
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:53,628
administrator privileges

112
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:59,470
because it's Program Files folder for

113
00:08:53,629 --> 00:09:03,439
that however explora can access it

114
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:06,040
so my SAS program channle name correct

115
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:06,040
the air

116
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,910
and copies itself

117
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,199
you

118
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,580
further executes the management launcher

119
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:38,360
the management or entire had us eat

120
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,360
vipers

121
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:44,490
so execute by high integrity level

122
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,799
and Lord much as the air

123
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:59,410
Martha's program has get the

124
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,410
administrator privileges

125
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,259
I have a demonstration video please

126
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,259
watch it

127
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,819
you

128
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,949
you

129
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,779
there are new name and copy command

130
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,779
images patch file

131
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,860
execute Maurice batch file and we start

132
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,860
Windows 10

133
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,800
you

134
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,079
you

135
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:54,519
see a MIDI was started with

136
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,519
administrator privileges

137
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,399
you

138
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,239
you

139
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,650
you

140
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,370
then Microsoft had the bank bounty

141
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:19,370
program

142
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:26,740
I thought this issue is very dangerous

143
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:26,740
and I want a little pocket money so

144
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:35,899
I submitted Bhanumati report - MS RC mas

145
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:35,899
RC state

146
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:43,740
this does not meet the bar for security

147
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,740
services

148
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,089
so cannot pacer liveth

149
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,750
however

150
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:00,600
this issue has been fixed

151
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:04,200
Microsoft's critiques like management

152
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:09,570
Ananta execute with medium integrity

153
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:11,900
level Microsoft must not have paid are

154
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,900
you God

155
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:22,950
let's move on to the next topic

156
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:26,990
made 12 27 teen

157
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,990
happen do you remember

158
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:39,060
it's daily fiber attacks by one opera

159
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,390
it's caused tremendous damage all over

160
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,390
the world

161
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,569
Microsoft gave answer for it

162
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:58,000
it's ransomware protection

163
00:12:53,540 --> 00:13:03,040
that's for Microsoft implemented it on

164
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,040
Windows 10 for creators update

165
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:14,390
this is lots of a protection screen

166
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:17,150
laaame protection hearts contoured for

167
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:22,210
the axis

168
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,209
however it's off by default

169
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,700
stop if thou eat

170
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:35,830
protected for that and arrow an absolute

171
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:39,900
control for the axis are displayed

172
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,900
let's look each I think

173
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,329
first he is protected orders

174
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:59,029
administrator can add for da he want and

175
00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:05,040
the era for the rotated by default

176
00:13:59,029 --> 00:14:08,689
documents pictures video music desktop

177
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,689
and favorite

178
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,920
just a moment there is a strange freight

179
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:21,000
windows system for de are protected by

180
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,899
default

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,420
you jury system holder is C colon

182
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:36,680
backslash Windows backslash system 32

183
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:36,680
but there is not include in this list

184
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:44,998
what is the truth I show you in

185
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,999
demonstration club now

186
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,869
you

187
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,770
you

188
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,830
first the last of a protection is

189
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:05,270
disabled yet

190
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:07,550
now l'm powershell with system

191
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:11,260
privileged

192
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,260
and create a fire

193
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,640
you

194
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,329
USPS exact six three four

195
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:36,110
now Who am I so

196
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,290
a parcel running with system freebie

197
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,290
dates

198
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,859
you

199
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,209
you

200
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:13,350
so both system for DES and

201
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,350
for the well not rocked

202
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:20,620
next enable the lanthum ear protection

203
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,620
here

204
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,400
you

205
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,650
you

206
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,699
you

207
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:06,140
I used Aphrodite not rocks because Lance

208
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:11,559
Samia prosecution does not work for for

209
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,559
the process that the all day being run

210
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,329
you

211
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,470
and this time it was blocked

212
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,470
successfully

213
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:47,470
in this way last time a protection is

214
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:50,760
very powerful function to broke even

215
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,760
system free blades

216
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,149
and create fight the system folder

217
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,950
of course it's not about

218
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,450
you

219
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:13,600
you

220
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:30,240
the truth is we no system for that is

221
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,240
not propagated by the heart

222
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,389
next yes

223
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:45,339
for the access administrator can add

224
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:47,510
applications that can access protected

225
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:53,750
for that

226
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:56,140
however there is no default list just a

227
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,140
moment

228
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,029
strange place too

229
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,750
apps determined by Microsoft as friendly

230
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:11,250
are always allowed

231
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,250
what does friendly

232
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,900
I'll show you in the most Edition from

233
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,900
now

234
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,760
you

235
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,100
first is shimmery

236
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,970
you

237
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,290
it's blocked

238
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:12,810
next it's Microsoft what

239
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,840
you

240
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,300
you

241
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,000
you

242
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,360
it's not blocked

243
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,280
next is explora

244
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,440
it's not product

245
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:07,270
next is 70

246
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,270
you

247
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:13,209
you

248
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,480
it's not blocked

249
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:35,940
just a moment next is a different

250
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,939
version of 7-zip

251
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:44,720
you

252
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,370
it's broke

253
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,929
you

254
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,490
so Tracy's

255
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,030
Microsoft only know

256
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:19,289
and this is

257
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,289
protection mechanism

258
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,049
education can access or folder by

259
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:26,049
default

260
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,810
when administrator enable the last mail

261
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,810
protection

262
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,380
I wrote up scan

263
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:45,280
protected orders

264
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,280
but the other apps cannot access it

265
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:53,570
you ain't seen nothing yet now I found

266
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:57,379
up

267
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:59,799
I found a burner VD or a thermal

268
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,799
protection

269
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:09,560
my idea is very simple

270
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:13,330
if we can inject Maria

271
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,330
into our own apps

272
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:23,950
we can access protested for that and the

273
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,950
ice Explorer here

274
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:35,280
there was similarly such yahoo idea is

275
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,280
using Microsoft Office

276
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:47,559
this time I use a different method

277
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,559
I show you in demonstration from now

278
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,250
you

279
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,480
it's target fire

280
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,459
it written hello world

281
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,669
you

282
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,720
you

283
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,460
La Marche us watch fire

284
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:46,679
as you can see this patch file add value

285
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,680
to the registry and listed Explorer

286
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,810
you

287
00:24:53,930 --> 00:25:03,039
a target file is encrypted

288
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,039
my Mars program is not brought

289
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:11,080
chicks are stud are set as of f Explorer

290
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:29,200
explora is loading marshes dear

291
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:31,679
in addition this IDL the area is on the

292
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,679
network

293
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,879
you

294
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,039
so my method I explain now

295
00:25:53,300 --> 00:26:03,379
it all started I wondered why can

296
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:08,620
explore erode and onedrive DRL because

297
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,620
the further different every page

298
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,360
so I searched in the latest

299
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,740
it was fun in HK CR

300
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:35,360
h kc r is that much it's get em with its

301
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:39,760
Casey you

302
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:46,330
and it's KCU talks takes precedence from

303
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:53,740
hklm which means if the explora loads up

304
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:59,070
dear and it passes written to HCL mmm

305
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:59,070
we can make extruder loader nicest deal

306
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:10,270
which deal meet the requirements

307
00:27:08,509 --> 00:27:15,090
and it

308
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:15,090
it's self a TT dot the air air

309
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,519
then I explained detail of mechanism

310
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,520
when user executes my SAS program

311
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,429
you

312
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:52,130
usually it reflects the path of self

313
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:52,129
attitude the area in EDM am to at KCR

314
00:27:53,300 --> 00:28:04,659
however well my sass program light mices

315
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,660
pass in HK see you it reflect to HK CR

316
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,250
when the system restart

317
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:16,519
explora loads meshes dear

318
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,460
you

319
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:31,409
it's revenge payback time

320
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:35,050
I started the bonneville teleport to

321
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:38,370
make our nsrc again

322
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,370
nsrc said

323
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:48,700
this does not meet the bar for security

324
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:48,700
services so cannot there's a lot

325
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:58,389
I searched the buff of securities

326
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:58,389
servicing on Microsoft website

327
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:04,150
certainiy it's not meat

328
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:14,740
moreover user account control and

329
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:19,730
control for the axis are not covered by

330
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:22,570
active bug bounty programs I give up

331
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,570
getting live out

332
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:35,700
I understand that Microsoft thinking

333
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:38,700
then how about others aunt Maria

334
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,700
application

335
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:49,170
this is a market share of Windows and

336
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:54,630
Maria application vendors

337
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:57,620
gerrae a bust he said Maria bites mcafee

338
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,620
and more

339
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:00,820
I took these

340
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:14,030
first a bust internet security hat

341
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,030
the last time you are sealed

342
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:20,550
ever

343
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:26,420
my my sixth year was able to encrypt the

344
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:26,419
text file with that being blocked

345
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:37,650
next is its mass security heart the last

346
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,070
time is sealed

347
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,070
Arriba

348
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:43,350
the same result

349
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,070
next Maria bites

350
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:57,950
me about premium had the last year

351
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:57,950
protection however

352
00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:01,619
it's same lizard

353
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:11,760
next McAfee

354
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,710
McAfee had the last Amir interceptor

355
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,399
however

356
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,399
results

357
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:28,090
as far as I've ticked aunt Maria

358
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,090
application cannot broke my bar well

359
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:39,640
finally it's a conclusion Microsoft does

360
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,790
not admit variability and not pain leave

361
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,790
us

362
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,700
well then nobody research it

363
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,740
which means it's not secure

364
00:31:55,299 --> 00:32:03,179
it's time to start taking local hacking

365
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,179
