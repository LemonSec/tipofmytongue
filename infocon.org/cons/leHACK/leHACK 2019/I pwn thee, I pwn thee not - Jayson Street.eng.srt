1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,559
module bonsoir

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,139
hey how's it going so let's get this

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,329
started this is this is my legal

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,310
disclaimer whenever I give an offensive

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,920
talk it's like well most people think my

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,419
talks are offensive but uh but this is

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,910
my legal disclaimer it's like so when I

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,289
talk about in this talk and I will talk

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,240
about things where I've done bad things

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,670
where it's like I've broken in or I've

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,859
done something to violate the trust of

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,640
somebody always remember the kittens I'm

13
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,980
adorable

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,050
okay I will not try to steal from you

15
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,180
kill you or ruin you financially unless

16
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,669
you pay me first there's always a

17
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,649
contract so when you see here those

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,210
moments you know just just think about

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,440
the kittens and everything should be

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,260
fine so this talk is called i pwned the

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,730
I pony not and basically to break it

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,160
down what this talk is going to be about

23
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:03,569
is the top three things that I love for

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,709
my target a victim client to do the

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,990
three things I'd love for them to do

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:09,780
because it makes it easier for me to rob

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,490
them and then also I talk about the

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,280
three things that I hate for them to do

29
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,298
because it makes it harder for me to rob

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,740
them and you know robbing people is fun

31
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,900
within limits remember the kittens it's

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,280
like already so so that's what I'm going

33
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,009
to talk about it I'll talk about and but

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,080
then I'm gonna end it with maybe talking

35
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,790
a little bit more about some of the

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,280
defensive things that you can do to make

37
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,540
your company a little bit harder and to

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,619
piss off the people that are trying to

39
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,960
rob you so let's get right into that if

40
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,549
you don't know about me it's like don't

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,860
worry it's like it's not many people do

42
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,210
it's like that's fine but I've done a

43
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,790
little things I've done a show on that

44
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,079
Geo in the upper left-hand corner it's

45
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,240
like I've been on the news on the right

46
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,570
but most importantly on the lower left

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,298
is actual pictures of me robbing people

48
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,240
it's like actually getting an employee

49
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,549
to get out of his desk to get on his

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,250
computer and start operating it the

51
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,320
lower picture is actually from me on the

52
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,259
South of France at a very nice hotel and

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,000
their underground employee area at 3

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,600
o'clock in the morning barefoot and

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,450
teenager

56
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,640
eternal pajama bottoms as I was getting

57
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,679
into there their employees sensitive

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,480
areas and then that other picture is me

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,980
just holding up a computer I had just

60
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,049
stole him from behind the teller line of

61
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,280
a bank in Beirut it's like where I

62
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,850
literally just walked in behind the

63
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,230
teller line while the client was the

64
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,910
teller was working with a client and I

65
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,440
didn't even say hello is very rude on

66
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,320
that engagement it's like so I just

67
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,109
walked in unplugged the machine it's

68
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,359
mine and walked out so that was a

69
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,830
finding so so those are the things that

70
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,690
I do that's what I do for a living

71
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,400
mostly it's like I like creating those

72
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:50,010
teachable moments I like being that

73
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,030
teachable moment so and I tell people

74
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,370
I'm the bad guy

75
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,260
before the real bad guy comes in and

76
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,630
does something bad it's like so I do it

77
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,090
for a good reason

78
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:05,940
one of the foundations of what started

79
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:07,500
this talk is just this whole industry

80
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,900
where we keep getting and we talk about

81
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,580
you know red teamers it's like we keep

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,200
putting red teamers on this pedestal

83
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,940
like they're ninjas they're like they're

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,260
doing all these high-level attacks and

85
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,490
if you look at the upper left-hand

86
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,109
corner it's like that's what we always

87
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,400
see you know right it's like saying oh

88
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,200
they're going in and doing all these

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,670
leet skills and go through the skylight

90
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,290
or they're doing all these kind of ninja

91
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:30,390
but they're doing all these things that

92
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:33,179
are so advanced and I'm like nah I just

93
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:37,290
usually walk in it's like is that leap

94
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,610
no I don't want it to be lead if you get

95
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,100
to the point where you're telling your

96
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,020
clients that you did this advanced

97
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,030
technique or you dropped O'Day on them

98
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:48,090
or you went in and you did all these

99
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,850
convoluted steps all your exec all the

100
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:56,250
executives here all your client here is

101
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,290
oh we're good we're safe because you're

102
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,760
ninjas you're like so special and

103
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,769
wizards and you know you put on your

104
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,390
robe and wizard hat and you're like yeah

105
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,400
you're so more advanced I don't have to

106
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,100
worry about those kind of threats so we

107
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,770
could be it we're okay that's not how

108
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,320
you get things changed instead of

109
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,620
showing executives how complicated your

110
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:20,709
attacks were show them how simple it can

111
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,240
be that's terrifying

112
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,470
like if I could win I tell you I did all

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,000
these advanced techniques it's like

114
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,340
you're gonna okay that's fine it's like

115
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,900
you know because if I tell you that if I

116
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,810
walked into a building for the very

117
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,219
first time never been there before never

118
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,259
knew any of the names of the manager

119
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,870
ever was and within 2 minutes and 22

120
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:40,240
seconds I was behind the teller line and

121
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,710
had full access to the bank every

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,849
section of it except for the vault for

123
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:47,590
over 30 minutes that's terrifying

124
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:50,020
because that means anybody can walk in

125
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,210
and do something like that that is

126
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,919
something that has to be fixed that is

127
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,599
something that has to be changed because

128
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,549
the attacks are not always going to be

129
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:00,400
so advanced sometimes they're just going

130
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:03,009
to be that easy and trust me it's that

131
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,630
easy it's like if you ever went and

132
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,880
talked to someone said like I'm from the

133
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,669
helpdesk it's like oh you're here to

134
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,770
make the network run faster have you

135
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,060
noticed everybody when you ask them is

136
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,840
the network running slow what their

137
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,120
answer is yes it is running slow you

138
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,909
could be on a t1 fiber line to your

139
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,080
desktop and you ask an employee that and

140
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:24,400
ever be like yeah it is running a little

141
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,840
slow it's like well I'm here to make it

142
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,590
faster I don't like do whatever you need

143
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,150
it's like you have full access it's like

144
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,409
I said we'll have to make it faster it's

145
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,090
like I need oh I need to log in here

146
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:35,770
here just log back out saying I'm

147
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:37,388
already sitting down so let's just just

148
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,789
tell me what your password is again it's

149
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:42,219
like oh oh that's what this okay and and

150
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:44,349
news and I kid you not in any company

151
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:46,180
it's like you don't you don't need to

152
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:48,099
guess that much it's like usually it's

153
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:52,870
going to be the name of the company and

154
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:56,650
if it's winner then it's in this 2019

155
00:05:52,870 --> 00:06:00,280
guess what the passwords going to be

156
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,690
he named winter 2019 it's like sometimes

157
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,698
they don't even do the company name it's

158
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,770
just winter 2019 because you gotta

159
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,889
because what happens is the password

160
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:13,750
policy resets for a company is every 90

161
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:15,759
days every three months every season so

162
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,789
if I'm attacking you in January

163
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,120
I'm trying winter if I'm tacking you in

164
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:22,599
July

165
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,699
I'm trying summer and that will work and

166
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,530
mostly every company that you go to it's

167
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,389
like it's sort of sad and that's one of

168
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,210
the reasons why people drink I think but

169
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:33,370
but it's just a fact and so we'll get a

170
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,930
little bit more about to that later so

171
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,830
sometimes it's just as simple of just

172
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,620
asking nicely

173
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,740
and getting that password and another

174
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,990
problem that we face in our industry is

175
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,479
your executives their expectations right

176
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,099
because they see they want you on that

177
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,780
that's what they want their enterprise

178
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:51,909
on the left that picture on the left

179
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,270
that is what their enterprise needs to

180
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,550
be that's what you need to create that's

181
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,400
what you need to build you need to

182
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,919
secure that you need to make that happen

183
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,929
and then you go jumps I guess I want to

184
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,030
make that happen how much money do I

185
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,099
have what's our budget and I'm like for

186
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,888
that on the right it's like we'll give

187
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:13,449
you enough money for that it's like but

188
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,370
make it work we want what's on the left

189
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,520
but we're gonna pay for what's on the

190
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,560
right and that can be a problem right

191
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:25,570
it's like because you're looking they're

192
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,650
like no so but that's one of the things

193
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,080
we're always coming because we're always

194
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,400
trying to get more resources from upper

195
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,650
management we're always trying to get

196
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,349
them to actually give us the things that

197
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,239
they we need but they don't understand

198
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:39,669
that and one of the key things I think

199
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,050
that's problem is is because we're not

200
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:43,060
explaining to them in ways that they

201
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,430
understand we're not showing them what

202
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,370
that risk is because let's face it the

203
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:52,330
better at your job that you are the less

204
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,949
they see right it's like you go to you

205
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,289
every call every end of the year you

206
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,120
have to go to your company and if you've

207
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,169
been very successful you'll have to go

208
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,120
and tell us like well look

209
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:02,740
have you noticed nothing really happened

210
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,110
this year it's like we didn't have any

211
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,240
breeches or there was no major outages

212
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,940
and like yeah that was great well if you

213
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,470
give us two million more euros for

214
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,660
Shearer will make sure nothing happens

215
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,250
again

216
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,750
and how does that work that's why they

217
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,770
see us as a call center so you have to

218
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,170
create metrics you have to create

219
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:23,260
reasons for them to understand that and

220
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,610
to actually give you them what you're

221
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,710
never getting that on the left okay

222
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,240
let's just be honest okay but hopefully

223
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,620
you can get a little bit more than that

224
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,180
you know actually get a door or

225
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,039
something put on there that might help

226
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,039
right so at least it'll get a little bit

227
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,500
more so let's go straight into one of

228
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:43,270
the first things that I love for my

229
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:46,900
attacker for my clients to do I love how

230
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:51,010
they don't and just the basic necessity

231
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:53,650
of training your employees to just

232
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,389
question something that doesn't look

233
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:57,639
right

234
00:08:55,389 --> 00:08:59,649
one of the key things one of the key

235
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:03,100
factors that you have in your arsenal

236
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:05,949
and information security is your

237
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:09,369
employees but you're so busy seeing them

238
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:10,988
as a liability you see them you're so

239
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:13,629
busy seeing them as a problem in a

240
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:14,889
possible breach area that you're not

241
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:17,410
realizing they're one of your best

242
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:18,999
assets but you got to train them to

243
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,279
question you got to empower them to

244
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:24,970
question I was on an engagement in

245
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,040
January and I was this client was like

246
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,129
very secured it's like they had a very

247
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,629
secured environment in their upper

248
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,549
office area and you had to go through

249
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:35,259
the lobby had to go through security

250
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:38,379
layer there and then there was a

251
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:39,999
security layer up up in their suite and

252
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:43,420
they owned like two floors and it was

253
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:45,220
like so they felt very secure and I will

254
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,949
always and I've constantly said this

255
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,209
it's like the only thing worse than no

256
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:53,670
security is a false sense of security

257
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:57,149
that's what gets you every single time

258
00:09:53,670 --> 00:10:01,179
because those employees were secured

259
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:04,269
they felt safe so they didn't need to

260
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:07,269
question when this you know devilishly

261
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:10,179
handsome guy in a jacket it's like I'm

262
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:13,540
joking it was me shows up to their desk

263
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:15,699
and says hi I'm with the IT department

264
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,349
it's like I'm checking to make sure that

265
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,238
our GPL policies are right for our USB

266
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,499
readwrite access on a device charging

267
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:21,730
policies and it's like so you can't

268
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:23,019
charge your mobile device onto our

269
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,639
computers because it's actually

270
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:25,509
conflicts for the TCB sacks so it's like

271
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,119
we're gonna have to make sure that

272
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:30,790
that's tested so I have this cable here

273
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:33,669
was a USB ninja it's like it's a

274
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,998
lightning charger cable I did not have a

275
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:39,189
phone attached to it it was just the

276
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:41,139
cable but with the little Adreno that's

277
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:43,238
hidden inside and I was like I just need

278
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,889
to test it the policy make sure it works

279
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:47,169
let me plug it into your computer I

280
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:49,360
plugged it in the computer I pulled out

281
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:50,829
the detonator it's like it's not really

282
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,809
detonated but it sounds clear when I say

283
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:54,189
detonator it's like so it's like it's

284
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,868
this little box that's got a little

285
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,579
blinky light on it and it's got an aunt

286
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:59,799
Anna it's it's cool-looking looks like a

287
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:03,008
detonator and so it's like so I could

288
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,899
have activated it like outside I could

289
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,519
have like activated it away from that I

290
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,289
could have kept it in my pocket and done

291
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,130
it but it was so much cooler and way

292
00:11:08,289 --> 00:11:11,770
more intimidating

293
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,180
I pulled it out of my jacket and I was

294
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,710
like Boop

295
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,089
it doesn't really sound it doesn't

296
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,650
really say Boop but it sounds cooler

297
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,930
when I say Boop so it's like Boop and

298
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,840
it's like all of a sudden no pad pops up

299
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,270
on their screen it automatically types

300
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,890
out this test completed successfully

301
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,790
thank you for your cooperation

302
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:34,260
smiley face emoji

303
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:37,360
I plugged in a charging cable and no pad

304
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,310
popped up on their desk

305
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,620
something's odd right we can agree

306
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,000
that's a little odd that's not something

307
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,089
that's supposed to happen every single

308
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,899
time that you plug in the cable what was

309
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,180
their response

310
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,720
what was their reaction

311
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,510
hmm okay eight people in that area all

312
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,820
sitting side by side I compromised their

313
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,439
machines every single one of them not

314
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,380
one person challenged to me

315
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,300
not one person questioned me now I do

316
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,340
security awareness engagements I don't

317
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,420
do red teaming it's like I don't believe

318
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,410
in doing their whole red teaming thing

319
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,719
it's like what I do is security

320
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,640
awareness engagements so once I go and I

321
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,490
destroy you and I find all the stuff II

322
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:18,760
and III get in I wait for two minutes

323
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,310
and then I come back and I talk to every

324
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,780
single person that I compromised and I

325
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,829
train them right then and there it's

326
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,439
like did you notice something was odd

327
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,180
well I was being a bad guy it's like

328
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,740
that's what a bad guy will do it's like

329
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,030
you need to know that from that next

330
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,030
time that you see something like that'd

331
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,650
be way more suspicious and so I on this

332
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,449
engagement was no different I went up to

333
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,060
those people and I asked all of them I

334
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,430
said

335
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,949
serious did you think that was odd

336
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:48,729
it's like it was just a cable and

337
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:51,580
they're like yeah I did think it was

338
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,750
weird it's like after you left III told

339
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,210
one of the people it's like I thought

340
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,920
that was really weird but did you call

341
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,450
with anybody do you talk now I didn't

342
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,529
want to make a fuss about it it's like

343
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:05,800
he was just no make a fuss make a fuss

344
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,060
if you see something unusual you need to

345
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,640
let them know and let them become

346
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,770
conditioned and empowered to make that

347
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,360
change to make that notice one of the

348
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,910
key things that we have a problem with

349
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,700
is that our employees don't feel

350
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,779
empowered they don't feel comfortable

351
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,220
reporting something because they want to

352
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:23,439
think that everything's okay

353
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,779
that's the main reason why I'm

354
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,300
successful is because if I'm not the

355
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:31,540
adorable IT Help Desk guy then I'm

356
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:36,189
something bad and no one wants something

357
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:38,890
bad to happen December 7th 1941 Pearl

358
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:42,930
Harbor Hawaii it was one of the first

359
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:45,550
bases in the world with a radar station

360
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:49,180
so it had advanced warning on planes

361
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,459
coming in and the the person manning the

362
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,770
radar station there on that morning in

363
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,420
December 7th

364
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:58,660
noticed a whole bunch of planes coming

365
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,790
in and it wasn't coming in from a vector

366
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,850
that was supposed to be there was no log

367
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,430
or traffic for that area and so what did

368
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,230
he do he reported it he went to a

369
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,150
supervisor hey there's these planes

370
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,750
coming in from this unusual vector what

371
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,959
do we do

372
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:17,860
what are they what could it be the world

373
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:21,430
was at war what could it be it's like

374
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,500
the supervisor said oh well those are

375
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:25,439
probably our training planes

376
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,930
just disregard

377
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,300
just the training planes spoiler alert

378
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,388
you know it wasn't it's like but it was

379
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,969
either that or it was something bad and

380
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:38,959
we don't want bad things to happen to us

381
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,459
so if I can give you a reasonable lie

382
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,638
that sounds more comforting than the

383
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:45,649
truth you're going to go with the lie so

384
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,180
you have to make sure your employees

385
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:51,449
question everything and feel comfortable

386
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,989
enough to report it to say well this

387
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:56,459
could be this but better safe than sorry

388
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,860
give them that empowerment give them

389
00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:01,018
that that ability to communicate to you

390
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,970
in a way where they see you not as

391
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,410
someone that is always trying to find

392
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,560
out that they're doing something wrong

393
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:09,120
and have them see you as someone who is

394
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,209
like an ally and someone who's like

395
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,000
trying to help them stay secure and that

396
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:17,279
helps that relationship so do that make

397
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,629
sure you're using them as the proper

398
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,550
thing that they are because they're part

399
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:22,350
of your security team they just don't

400
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,209
realize it and if you're not utilizing

401
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,980
they never will

402
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,479
so make them understand that they're

403
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,269
part of your security team and they have

404
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,399
responsibilities for that one of the

405
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:34,800
things I hate it's like it's not

406
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,839
technically the CIA it's like but I do

407
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,189
tell people it's like it's lobbies and I

408
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,600
don't know if this is actually the CIA

409
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,519
Lobby it's like I tell people if I'm

410
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,899
ever going to the CIA agent headquarters

411
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,670
it's probably going to be going through

412
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,800
the back door with a bag over my head so

413
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:49,769
sorry I'm not sure I'll ever see the

414
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,649
front of the lobby but but but this is

415
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:55,949
one of the things that I hate open well

416
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,810
monitored areas those are horrible for

417
00:15:55,949 --> 00:16:00,569
someone who's trying to do something bad

418
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:03,719
you know why because where is the place

419
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:06,990
that I can sit down comfortably and like

420
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,089
wait it's like to monitor the traffic to

421
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,759
see where the security placements are to

422
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:14,449
see where the flow of traffic is it's

423
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,949
like there's not there it's like so

424
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:19,170
another good story we should probably

425
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:22,319
put me on a couple more lists you know

426
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:25,349
of interest was I was in Russia last

427
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:28,410
year and I had some friends that work

428
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,180
for Kaspersky and and actually I'm

429
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:31,740
friends with Eugene it's like he's a

430
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,258
great guy actually it's like he's really

431
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,730
cool and I happen to be a Moscow and

432
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,189
they're like hey come and check out the

433
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,270
headquarters and I was like get invited

434
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:40,890
to go to Kaspersky take

435
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,079
a Moscow it's like you don't turn that

436
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,029
down it's like you know I sure let's go

437
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,350
I'm up for it I got plenty of time I'm

438
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:48,689
just like you know hanging out touring

439
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,029
it's like so I go to because first his

440
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,709
headquarters and their office was like

441
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,000
their their Lobby was like really well

442
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:55,859
open it's I mean there was like a but

443
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,540
there was one side wall with this long

444
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:02,040
couch it was like looked really comfy

445
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:03,689
and I'm not technically a bad guy but

446
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,490
it's like I still can't turn off that

447
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,750
part where you think bad right you know

448
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,400
it's like whenever you go to a building

449
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,809
you go things like oh yeah that doors

450
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,040
not secured right there it's like I'd

451
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,689
probably get in there it's like oh I

452
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,379
could like you know I could come in I

453
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:14,880
mean it's just

454
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,920
I'm always casing the place I'm always

455
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,870
figuring out what the bad thing is it's

456
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,750
like or how I can circumvent something

457
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:24,030
it's just how I'm wired so I wasn't

458
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,010
gonna do anything bad but I look sketchy

459
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,869
AF let's be honest okay so it's like

460
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,559
even on turning mode it's like I looked

461
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:33,570
a little sketchy so I go in and I'm my

462
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,830
first I was like home cuz merchants like

463
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,149
their security company that's how good

464
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,580
their security is let's see where they

465
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:41,520
so I start to sit down I don't go and

466
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,659
register where I'm supposed to it's like

467
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,879
I just gotta try to sit down on the

468
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,520
couch to just like in case the place and

469
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,179

didn't even touch the leather okay for

471
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,700

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,650
over you know I mean he was he was being

473

487
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:29,850
right it's like so he was very polite

488
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,889
very nice but mother he was basically

489
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:35,669
said you are not staying here until

490
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:37,020
you're verified it's like so he kindly I

491
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,450
mean like he didn't like kindly assist

492
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,780
me physically but he kindly walked me

493
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:45,510
over to the registration and he stayed

494
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,850
there until they confirmed and

495
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,740
identified who I was and that I had

496
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,719
business there and I was supposed to be

497
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,580
there and I was given a visitor's badge

498
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,929
as soon as that was done he's cool I got

499
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,370
to sit on the couch I got to walk around

500
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,840
the artwork too got a really cool weird

501
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,370
elephant thing from Donna Lee that

502
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,990
looked really neat but they have a

503
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,850
little Muse they have a Museum of all

504
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,350
their old products and stuff no ever

505
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,600
seen the Jackie Chan and Eugene

506
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,129
Kaspersky mashup thing it's like it's

507
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,719
really cool you should google it it's

508
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:16,168
like they had a box of the app so it was

509
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,559
really cool and and I was done because I

510
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:21,120
was vetted I was verified I've been to

511
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,759
other offices where they have like a

512
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,129
Starbucks there which is great because

513
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,419
then I can like put my Wi-Fi pineapple

514
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:28,860
out and start attacking people that are

515
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:30,779
going in for their coffee before they go

516
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,639
to work or they're having their meetings

517
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:34,350
it's like and no one questions how long

518
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:36,418
you're gonna be there I mean yeah it

519
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,799
cost me a latte or a hot chocolate those

520
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,110
things are expensive at Starbucks but

521
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:41,908
still worth it because you know it's

522
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,209
like I'm getting a lot of Intel while

523
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:47,399
I'm staying in that Lobby so you've got

524
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,850
to have when you want a secured area

525
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:52,860
your areas only is secured as your whole

526
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,709
building as what people have access to

527
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,750
and if you're not controlling that then

528
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:59,070
you're having problems it's like because

529
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,980
people like me are going to be coming in

530
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,049
with RFID the coners either proxmark

531
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,220
three or actually I think I got four now

532
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:06,779
so I don't have the three because I'm

533
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,919
poor but it's like hey you also got the

534
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:09,509
boss cloner which is a really cool

535
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,029
gadget that does it from three feet away

536
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:13,620
it's like and you get those devices and

537
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:14,970
it's like and those are perfect in those

538
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,979
kind of areas where it's like where

539
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,259
there's a coffee shop and a line where

540
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,080
you can bump up to someone it's like and

541
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:24,539
clone their badge or you can like hang

542
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,230
out by and I was in one location where

543
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:30,870
literally right by the gate no security

544
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,659
nobody had a problem with this guy you

545
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,250
know in a I don't think I think I was

546
00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:37,820
wearing a leather jacket it's like just

547
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:41,129
hanging out right by the the card reader

548
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,720
and it's like that's not cool it's like

549
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:44,428
because I mean I I do not look like I

550
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,529
belong near your card readers at all

551
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:49,110
anyway it's like especially there for

552
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:51,690
like 10 to 15 minutes as your employees

553
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,090
are going through it so monitor those

554
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,490
areas keep an eye on what's graphic and

555
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:59,549
make sure you let the people know that

556
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,019
visit you let them know that they've

557
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,980
been recognized they've been

558
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,870
acknowledged that they that you've like

559
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,730
you

560
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,709
you know well actually not you probably

561
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,000
you right there just okay so yeah you

562
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,410
got to make sure that they know that

563
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,400
thing you got to make sure that they're

564
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:18,140
being acknowledged now you'll see

565
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,730
there's a common theme of me making fun

566
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,320
of the US government and their security

567
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,720
policies and it's not because I dislike

568
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,669
the government or America or anything

569
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,650
like that it's just when it comes to

570
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,330
really bad security policies they seem

571
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,000
to be really good at giving bad examples

572
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,590
to four so it's not my fault it's theirs

573
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,110
and I have no regrets

574
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,629
so and when we talk about really bad

575
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,520
security you can't really even start a

576
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,470
conversation without mentioning the TSA

577
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,410
and I don't to get too mad because I

578
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:48,170
still got to fly back but egress

579
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:52,370
filtering how many people have a

580
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:57,250
firewall rule in their company that says

581
00:21:52,370 --> 00:22:03,439
any internal can go to anywhere external

582
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:06,080
any protocol allow no logging do not

583
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:10,300
raise your hand you'll make me cry okay

584
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,010
because a lot of people have that rule

585
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,290
they're like why do we have to monitor

586
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:18,530
what's going outbound we're worried

587
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:22,480
about coming what's coming in yeah back

588
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:25,190
in 2000 that was a really big concern

589
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,860
but now all your employees now your

590
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,370
attacks are coming from endpoints now

591
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:34,189
I'm compromising Bob and accounting and

592
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:38,110
he's now my point of entry so what is he

593
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,760
doing he's creating a secured connection

594
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:44,330
outbound to my command and control

595
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:46,340
device and now I've got internal access

596
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,590
to your network because you didn't

597
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,149
monitor Bob going to one of the payloads

598
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,360
that I have on my bash bunny from hack

599
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:58,540
five is very simple it opens up a

600
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:02,299
command prompt and it telnet to Powell

601
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:04,519
blinky lights dot NL

602
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:05,989
it's a great payload because you know

603
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:08,629
what happens when you open up a command

604
00:23:05,989 --> 00:23:11,479
prompt and you telling that pal blinky

605
00:23:08,629 --> 00:23:14,809
lights died in an L you hit ASCII Star

606
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:16,219
Wars in the window it's awesome it's

607
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:18,459
like you know the little characters it's

608
00:23:16,219 --> 00:23:23,719
like these little animations it's great

609
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:28,309
the important thing is why does Bob in

610
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:32,239
accounting have telnet access to the

611
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:36,489
Netherlands with he's in like a doughnut

612
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:36,489
shop Factory in Phoenix

613
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:41,820
necessary if you look at one of the

614
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,678
biggest breaches on and the biggest

615
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,870
example of fail when it comes to egress

616
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,280
filtering Sony

617
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,889
I'm not gonna lie I'm not trying to kick

618
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,940
them when they're down it's like but how

619
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,900
do you lose one point eight three

620
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,800
terabytes of data

621
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:02,530
leaving your network and no one going

622
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,950
that's odd one point eight three

623
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,970
terabytes okay I mean a network I should

624
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,710
have said maybe we should increase the

625
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:10,300
bandwidth maybe we need to like make the

626
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,460
pipe but someone should have said

627
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,000
something

628
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:17,860
why is your data going to Paraguay

629
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,220
especially over a terabyte that's that's

630
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:23,439
data it's I mean it I mean it could've

631
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:26,410
been just one MSX access database but

632
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,840
it's still a lot of data it's one point

633
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,910
eight three terabytes and no one

634
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,360
questioned it no one questioned what

635
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:37,120
that was so you have to do that you have

636
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,360
to be able to show them that so another

637
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,360
thing is

638
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:46,190
one of things that hey is dual factor

639
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,529
authentication

640
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,750
gosh that sucks you go through all the

641
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:52,940
trouble to steal something from someone

642
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,879
and you realize you need another piece

643
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,460
to take to get in that is not fun that's

644
00:24:55,879 --> 00:25:00,379
very disappointing it's like I've hate

645
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,450
you know cloning an RFID badge going

646
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:06,649
like haha and then it's like I get to

647
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:08,419
the O keypad mother you know it's like

648
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:09,678
we're am I gonna do now it's like okay

649
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:11,899
I've got part of it I don't have the

650
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,399
second part one of the things I like

651
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:16,459
about that but it all depends on what

652
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:18,830
keypad because I love security in

653
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,779
certain buildings that like oh we need

654
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,299
to do a factor have to use a hid badge

655
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:23,960
oh and they gotta have a keypad what's

656
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:25,460
the code

657
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,750
oh those who just put a keypad on

658
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,519
there's fine it's like just everybody

659
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,470
can have the same code and if everybody

660
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:34,490
has the same code what happens to the

661
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:37,639
numbers that are used over and over day

662
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:41,210
after day you look at the keypad you go

663
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:45,649
like hmmm the number three the number

664
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,049
one the number two and the number four

665
00:25:45,649 --> 00:25:50,750
are all rubbed off and everything else

666
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:53,330
looks pristine and brand-new I wonder

667
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:56,299
what the code is and it doesn't even

668
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,710
have to be one two three four spoiler

669
00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,168
alert it usually is one two three four

670
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,659
it doesn't have to be that I still have

671
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:05,629
24 different keys that I have to try

672
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:08,690
only 24 were four digits I only have 24

673
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:10,219
tries to get the right one

674
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,309
it's like so you have to make sure that

675
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,049
you're using a keypad that that you you

676
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:17,090
change out that you don't wear the keys

677
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:19,039
down to as I especially when you're like

678
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,330
in a garage area I was in one place

679
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,759
actually in a warehouse area it was

680
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,449
hilarious because it was it wasn't worn

681
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,909
down

682
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,429
it was just brown it's like because

683
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:30,200
people's dirty hands were just like it

684
00:26:28,429 --> 00:26:32,799
was just okay there's the key

685
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,299
complication I know what to use now so

686
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,999
make sure that you're using dual factor

687
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:39,408
authentication one of the ways that I

688
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:41,029
see this is that banks

689
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,529
it's like banks have dual factor I

690
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:45,139
thought I was going into a bank and

691
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:47,509
doing a sweep and it wasn't implemented

692
00:26:45,139 --> 00:26:49,189
quite right because banks are very

693
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:51,289
serious about their money transfers

694
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,659
right you can't transfer just a million

695
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:56,389
dollars muli nilly it's like you've got

696
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:57,859
to like have controls and one of the

697
00:26:56,389 --> 00:27:00,949
controls for transferring a million

698
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:04,189
dollars is the person authorizing it has

699
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,020
to have a key fob their digital

700
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,260
signature

701
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:12,500
incident this key gives you the right to

702
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:16,580
transfer millions of dollars it's a very

703
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:19,520
prized possession 85 90 percent of the

704
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,280
time that I saw an executives desk the

705
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,980
key fob was tucked into the laptop

706
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,350
but I'm like that's not dual factor

707
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,850
authentication people it's like you know

708
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,610
that's not how that works that's not how

709
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:35,080
any of this works it's like don't worry

710
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:37,459
another 10% they were more secure

711
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,809
they've literally just had you just had

712
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,760
to pull up in the drawer and it was in

713
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:42,590
the front drawer it's like so they they

714
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,289
actually hit it from the laptop so good

715
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,870
on them right it took me an extra it did

716
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:49,970
take me an extra 14 seconds to get that

717
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,699
so that that created a little bit of a

718
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,900
delay but so that's something that's

719
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,789
important you gotta let them know it's

720
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,470
like dual factor authentication has to

721
00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:00,230
be taken seriously and has to actually

722
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:03,530
be dual factor one of the things that

723
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:05,720
also irritated me in when I was going I

724
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,030
told you about the what they did wrong

725
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:11,690
in January one of the things they did

726
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:13,879
right and I have not seen very often is

727
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,159
they owned the whole two floors of this

728
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,740
office building right so you're thinking

729
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,990
once you're inside behind the the

730
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:24,880
security everything should be free and

731
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:26,710
open do you know what the brothers did

732
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,840
they made it where you needed to badge

733
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:33,789
in every single section and Department

734
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,220
so I sneak up through the freight

735
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:37,809
elevator and I'm out and I'm like I'm

736
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:39,610
about to go to the first door and it's

737
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:43,480
like I'm like oh I'm free and easy it's

738
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:45,879
all clear now and I'm like oh I stuck in

739
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,039
this one section I hope it's a good one

740
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,210
you know it's like hope there's a lot of

741
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:51,070
data because I don't have anymore

742
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,110
accident it was a good it was a good

743
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,668
section because a lady left her badge on

744
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:56,379
the desk and I stole it and I didn't had

745
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:57,970
full access to the whole building but

746
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,440
it's like but first I was sweating

747
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,259
bullets because I was like I'm trapped

748
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,990
in this one area so you have so that

749
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:07,090
segmentation is also really good at in a

750
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,500
physical environment as well and people

751
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,389
should be conditioned that it's not that

752
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,950
big of a deal to just badge in to get

753
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:13,949
through from one area to the other

754
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:19,790
so continuing on one of the things I

755
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,129
love is people going through all the

756
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,480
trouble of creating procedures and then

757
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,700
no one needs to feel like they have to

758
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,320
follow it and another example from the

759
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:31,190
US government thank you very much for

760
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:33,439
for showing your fails is to civilians

761
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:37,790
somehow breached an Air Force Base and

762
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:41,500
were found only only when one of them

763
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:46,000
told the airman she had been kidnapped

764
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:48,639
some guy kidnapped a woman

765
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,220
somewhere in Nevada probably Vegas let's

766
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:54,559
be honest okay it's like kidnaps a woman

767
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,379
puts our in a car drives are out to

768
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,330
desert for who knows what gets turned

769
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:03,649
around drives onto an Air Force Base

770
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,658
realizes I think I've made a huge

771
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:07,070
mistake I instantly regret this decision

772
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:10,100
it's like freaks out doesn't know what

773
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:12,200
to do gives the lady enough time to get

774
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,389
out of the vehicle run up to the guard

775
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,970
Minh whose first words I'm pretty sure

776
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:18,969
like what are you doing here you know

777
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,950
I we have to assume I'm just saying we

778
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:25,720
have to assume some procedures were not

779
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,389
followed

780
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,200
okay the gardening made not have done

781
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:33,340
his job when he saw the civilian car

782
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,500
driving straight onto the base and he

783
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,879
lets him in it's like or reported or

784
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,259
didn't say anything it's like I'm not

785
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:40,449
saying he was sleeping or playing video

786
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:43,120
games he was doing something incompetent

787
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,460
let's just be honest okay and you know

788
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,008
that's not the only best example of not

789
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,840
following procedure one of the one of

790
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:51,190
the stories I think is really humorous

791
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,799
and you can google this later to get the

792
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:59,379
exact results is back in the Cold War

793
00:30:53,799 --> 00:31:01,240
error a Russian agent drove onto a Air

794
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:02,899
Force Base a US Air Force Base in

795
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,109
Germany

796
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:08,518
okay he drove it there walked to the

797
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:12,810
airstrip

798
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:16,170
took a missile off the plane

799
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,790
put it in a will barrel they did they

800
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,410
didn't make it clear if he brought the

801
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,580
wheelbarrow or he stole it I really hope

802
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,580
he stole it because that's just cooler

803
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,129
right it's like he took the missile put

804
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:28,020
it in a wheelbarrow willed it back to

805
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:29,400
his mercedes-benz I'm just assuming okay

806
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,170
I'm sorry I'm not trying to be you know

807
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:33,300
stereotypical but I'm pretty sure was a

808
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:37,440
mercedes-benz plus it into the back of

809
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:39,540
his car puts a red flag on the tip

810
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,160
because it's sticking out of the window

811
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,270
and let's face it German laws were

812
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,310
German laws you don't mess with those

813
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:48,530
right it's like so he put the red flag

814
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:48,530
on top of the missile and drove out

815
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:55,679
with the missile he went back to his

816
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,280
apartment he disassembled the missile

817
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,140
and shipped it piece by piece back to

818
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,399
Mother Russia and let's face it was a

819
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,750
German postal system it was very

820
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,700
efficient it's like that was a good call

821
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,970
on his part it's like and was able to

822
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:13,170
transport the complete missile back

823
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:15,500
we can all agree some procedures were

824
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,500
not followed

825
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,970
and that's your problem it doesn't

826
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:24,130
matter what you have on paper if your

827
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:25,780
employees are not being tested to make

828
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:29,500
sure they're following those procedures

829
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:31,090
you don't really have procedures you

830
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,190
have guidelines you have hopes and

831
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:34,510
dreams and those are so easily crushed

832
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,220
trust me it's like I've got plenty of

833
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:39,610
stories so it's like you don't follow

834
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:42,970
those you follow procedures that are

835
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:45,520
tested and verified and repercussions if

836
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:49,440
they're failing so that's what needs to

837
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:52,290
be done that's what needs to happen

838
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,880
so let's go to the next one we're going

839
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:55,170
to the point now so you I've given you

840
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,580
like three stories and I giving you

841
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,440
three stories of bad three series of

842
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,000
good and hopefully you chuckle a little

843
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,280
bit you're like okay Jason what's the

844
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,530
punchline what what does this do for us

845
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,930
what am I going to bring back because

846
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:09,540
one of the things that I really hate

847
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:10,950
about conferences it's like and some

848
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,480
people that are coming out here they'll

849
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,160
come out and they'll tell you all the

850
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,040
different ways that they've broken

851
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,560
something which is awesome because we're

852
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,909
all like breaking things right but as

853
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,409
soon as you finish you tell me how

854
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:24,780
something's broken or something's not

855
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,700
done right you better be telling me how

856
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,200
to fix it

857
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,360
he better giving me ways to make it

858
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,600
better because I don't need just to know

859
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,010
how it fails or how it's not working

860
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,580
it's like I need to know how to make it

861
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:38,280
better

862
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,300
so the next part of the talk is where

863
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,860
we're gonna talk about some of the

864
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:44,010
things that you can take back to your

865
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,449
company and ask them questions and and

866
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:47,129
these are some important questions that

867
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,440
you need to ask your company about and

868
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,360
see what they see what their answers are

869
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,470
you're not going to like all of them but

870
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,149
these are questions that you should

871
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,880
bring back to your company to help

872
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:59,220
better your security one of the things

873
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,690
that you need to ask yourself is insider

874
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:04,950
threats which one fits the bill which do

875
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,170
you when you look at these two pictures

876
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:09,150
which do you want to think is the

877
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,450
biggest threat it's like I'll let y'all

878
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,280
later

879
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:13,469
I just realized I got a little I got a

880
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,179
little laser pointer here no it doesn't

881
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:16,709
come as a laser pointer darn I was

882
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:19,410
reported so the first one right there on

883
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:20,940
the left is uh you can google that later

884
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:24,779
it's Richard Hanson or something Robert

885
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,270
Hanson he was a malicious actor and the

886
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,910
FBI it's like he was a malicious actor

887
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,610
in the FBI he did really bad things for

888
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:35,609
money and second he was like an insider

889
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,880
threat and that was malicious and that

890
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:41,669
was he was out to destroy and do damage

891
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:46,610
okay cool I agree but what about this

892
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:46,609
any this person here on the right

893
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:52,839
they didn't do anything malicious they

894
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:54,899
just did something incredibly stupid

895
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:57,549
and that's an insider threat as well

896
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,979
they weren't trying to do any damage to

897
00:34:57,549 --> 00:35:02,200
apartment of Homeland Security but they

898
00:34:59,979 --> 00:35:05,038
literally let them pose with the TSA

899
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,038
security keys

900
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:11,280
they let him pose in a national news

901
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:15,930
article a way that you can conveniently

902
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,599
now 3d print your own TSA keys and when

903
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,160
questioned about it the department

904
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,119
homeland security didn't go and fess up

905
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,538
well yeah you're right that was a

906
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,579
mistake

907
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:25,109
no no that's government we can't let

908
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,760
mitt you know actual fault we just give

909
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:29,220
you plenty of examples of it so it's

910
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,809
like so what they did was like well we

911
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,430
don't really care too much about the

912
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:34,079
concern about the security aspect of

913
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,788
those keys it's more of a convenience

914
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,619
thing it's like this is the same

915
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:39,960
government that wants keys to all your

916
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:41,520
mobile devices if they treat those keys

917
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,869
like that what do you think they're

918
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,538
gonna treat your encryption keys like

919
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:47,280
that's a problem that's something to

920
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:49,260
think about because this wasn't a

921
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,940
malicious actor this was just stupidity

922
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,730
this was just someone trying

923
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,069
I had one environment where one employee

924
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,380
who was the best employee he was doing

925
00:35:56,069 --> 00:36:01,980
really good and what he decided to do

926
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:04,349
was very simple I'm going to be more

927
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,260
effective at my job by bringing a

928
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:09,510
wireless router plugging the internet

929
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,640
section into the internal network and

930
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:14,520
putting that wireless router underneath

931
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,799
the conference table so now when I'm at

932
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:20,460
the conference table I can still get my

933
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:21,720
emails I can still do work I'm not just

934
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,340
wasting their time just being in this

935
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,509
meeting

936
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,340
it's like do you know how much fun that

937
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,600
was finding that in the parking lot it's

938
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:29,310
like in knowing that I had internal

939
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:32,700
access to their whole company before I

940
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:36,180
actually got on site that's a problem

941
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:37,950
that's an insider threat stop looking

942
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:40,049
for insider threats from just malicious

943
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,750
motivations just for someone trying to

944
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,460
actively do something bad look for the

945
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,470
people that are also trying to be

946
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,240
helpful the people that are trying to be

947
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,160
more efficient and are doing it wrong

948
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,410
the people were just making mistakes

949
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,810
because those are insider threats as

950
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:59,310
well and another thing that you need to

951
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:01,410
ask your employees is oh this is going

952
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:03,330
further on it's like on insider threats

953
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,279
this is a great example of one two

954
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,720
senior Trump administration official who

955
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,040
met on Wednesday discussed whether to

956
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,140
seek legislation prohibiting tech

957
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,750
companies from using forms of encryption

958
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,379
that law enforcement can't break

959
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:18,020
who's terrified

960
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,760
everybody's if you're not terrified i I

961
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:26,060
didn't translate that properly enough

962
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,750
bad little bad okay the horrible that's

963
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:30,049
terrible

964
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:31,760
it's the he blow there it is t blow the

965
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,870
acid that bad - I'm sorry I apologize

966
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,850
I'm not trying to murder your language

967
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,980
it's like but that's what they're trying

968
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,569
to do and that's one of the things that

969
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,690
you have to be worried about because

970
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:44,990
they don't do good with data this right

971
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:47,030
here was from border control one of

972
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:50,629
their employees didn't do their policy

973
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:53,540
right took sensitive data over 400 gigs

974
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,720
that we know of and transferred it from

975
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,940
the internal homeland security network

976
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,009
on to their personal they're not the

977
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:03,200
person with the company laptop on their

978
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,740
company's network

979
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:10,118
so they broke policy they broke

980
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,979
procedure and then they leaked it and

981
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:14,510
instead of the the border control owning

982
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,950
up to it going yeah that was a bad thing

983
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,140
we're doing they decide to issue a

984
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:21,169
statement going like oh we did a search

985
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,690
for the dark web your data is secure I'm

986
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,549
like really it's like who who came up

987
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,510
with that idea it's like when we lost on

988
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:29,150
this day - what're we gonna do it's like

989
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:30,770
we keep using a PT can we blame China on

990
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,270
this one it's like maybe I don't know

991
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,829
it's like hey but just say that we

992
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,099
scoured the dark web we didn't find that

993
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:39,859
that'll make everybody feel better

994
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:41,869
normally it would except for when Joseph

995
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,210
Cox did a search for like several

996
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:48,950
minutes and came up with 400 gigs of

997
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:51,200
that data on the dark web so once again

998
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:53,720
not filling the warming Feelies when it

999
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,848
comes to my data so you have to be

1000
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,970
washed out you have to okay because no

1001
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:01,970
one did anything malicious in this

1002
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:04,930
incident but a lot of malicious things

1003
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:07,359
are possible now because of it

1004
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:09,308
and one of the things you need to ask is

1005
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,490
a very simple thing who do you ask for

1006
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:14,770
identification in your facility do you

1007
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,419
let just anybody walk by without any

1008
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:20,079
proper badge or identification without

1009
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,609
being questioned who on this list would

1010
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,690
you ask who all these pictures would you

1011
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:27,509
ask

1012
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:31,230
everyone everyone should be asked if

1013
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:32,580
you're a CEO if you're an executive the

1014
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:34,140
janitor especially that Jim deters

1015
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,270
pacifically if you've seen the show it's

1016
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,060
like or security they should have proper

1017
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:42,480
identification you never know when your

1018
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:45,210
employee has been let go your coworker

1019
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,090
may been do a great one day then left

1020
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:50,640
off the next and still has access maybe

1021
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:52,470
he's not supposed to be there so you

1022
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,480
need to question and make sure it's like

1023
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,879
your delivery people it's like and I'm

1024
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,530
not telling people to go in and if you

1025
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,430
see a stranger you know go tackle them

1026
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,170
or something because that might be me

1027
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,120
and I'm fragile and I bruise easily okay

1028
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:05,550
it's like you don't have to directly

1029
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:08,040
confront the person but you have to

1030
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,810
report it you have to let someone know

1031
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,330
that there's someone that strange does

1032
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:14,310
an identification in the facility so

1033
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:16,529
they can be checked and verified it's

1034
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:19,670
just as simple they have to have proper

1035
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,670
identification at all times

1036
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:24,359
so the next thing is what does your

1037
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:26,490
social media profile really say about

1038
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,098
you

1039
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,419
how many people on a pen test in this

1040
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:32,160
day and age and I mean this is a legit

1041
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,030
question cuz I'm actually I've never

1042
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,250
said it this way but I'm actually

1043
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:38,520
curious how many people on a legit pen

1044
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:41,510
test run an nmap scan it's like on the

1045
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,509
external IP address

1046
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,970
there's a few okay that's legit that's

1047
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,140
not trying to make fun of anything

1048
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:49,109
that's just a little chick question

1049
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,359
because I don't use in map anymore I

1050
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,440
don't scan your network perimeter

1051
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,580
anymore

1052
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:58,890
it's like I scan your Facebook and I

1053
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,840
scan your Twitter and I scan your

1054
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:02,670
snapchat and your tic TOCs and your all

1055
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:05,010
your instagrams and all the little

1056
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:06,750
social medias it's like me and my 35

1057
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,840
accounts are very popular on some of

1058
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:11,790
those platforms it's like so you go over

1059
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,470
and that's what I'm scanning because

1060
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:17,370
that's the information I'm getting I'm

1061
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:21,779
no longer attacking the network layer we

1062
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:25,470
have become very very good at securing

1063
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:29,570
the OSI layer model from zero or one to

1064
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:32,669
seven very good but what about layer 8

1065
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:36,029
what about the human layer

1066
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:38,250
not so much so I'm not going to work on

1067
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:40,829
the stuff that I know is hardened I want

1068
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,869
to go where it's easier and so I always

1069
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:44,460
tell people I don't have to bypass your

1070
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:47,730
firewall if I can bypass the

1071
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:49,799
receptionist it's just that simple it's

1072
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:52,010
like I don't need to evade your IDs if I

1073
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:53,990
can invade your security

1074
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,550
so you need to do that you need to make

1075
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:58,368
sure your employees understand that the

1076
00:41:55,550 --> 00:42:00,290
information that they're giving out to

1077
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:03,020
the world

1078
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,430
is public usually some have private

1079
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,100
accounts with most of its public

1080
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,509
especially for the executives because

1081
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,430
I'm not usually attacking the person in

1082
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:13,970
the mailroom I'm attacking the

1083
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:16,879
executives my first starting point on an

1084
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:19,609
attack is the about Us page on a

1085
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,100
company's website because what are you

1086
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:23,840
providing the list of targets I mean

1087
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,000
your board of directors and your

1088
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,820
executives you're telling me who to go

1089
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,830
after and that's what I'm gathering

1090
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:33,020
information from that's where I'm doing

1091
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:35,810
my recon from it's like I'm going to

1092
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,759
your company's page on Facebook and I'm

1093
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,860
looking to see which employees shared an

1094
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,030
article from you or liked an article

1095
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,530
because that means they're very active

1096
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:45,560
and they're very good and they're very

1097
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:48,380
sociable and I love being sociable it's

1098
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,779
like I am an 85 year old retired Air

1099
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,640
Force lieutenant colonel Jack O'Neill on

1100
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,350
Twitter it's like that my granddaughter

1101
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,190
got me involved on Twitter and I tweet

1102
00:42:54,350 --> 00:43:00,529
mostly about mowing the lawn working in

1103
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:02,480
my garage and how social media is

1104
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:05,930
destroying the fabric of American

1105
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,860
society it's like I am also a 23 year

1106
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:14,330
old woman who just graduated with her

1107
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:17,030
CPA and getting into accounting and I

1108
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:19,490
literally had one of my victims clients

1109
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,830
actually endorsed me for my accounting

1110
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,600
skills and I thought that was awesome I

1111
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:25,610
mean it's like I had compromised you and

1112
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,790
you you endorsed me that was perfect it

1113
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:30,230
was a win-win situation for me so I am

1114
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,820
all these different kinds of things

1115
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,130
because that's where the information is

1116
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,890
I had an executive higher me wants to go

1117
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:39,730
after in Spearfish his company I went

1118
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:42,170
all I did was found his Twitter account

1119
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,840
found that he went to a conference three

1120
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,810
months before went to the conference's

1121
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:50,180
website saw their speaker list found one

1122
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:53,299
that was like in the same business in

1123
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,490
the same region as my target and then I

1124
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:58,130
stole his identity and then I sent an

1125
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:01,100
email to the executive who hired me to

1126
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:04,550
Spearfish his company 24 hours before

1127
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,110
and since him an email from that speaker

1128
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,430
saying it was great meeting you three

1129
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,690
months ago at the conference like we

1130
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:10,940

1131
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:12,500
board of directors for our site here's

1132
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,880
the website please look it over and list

1133
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,550
know if you're interested it would be

1134
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,350
great to have you on

1135
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:18,300
it was great meeting you and having a

1136
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:19,500
conversation with you and who here is

1137
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,090
gonna remember three months what

1138
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,210
conversations you had here at this

1139
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:26,310
conference some of them probably it's

1140
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:29,430
like after around midnight maybe not so

1141
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:32,490
much but it's like hit this guy clicked

1142
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:34,480
on the link within 12 hours knowing that

1143
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:37,000
he was being Spearfish

1144
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,760
it's like social media was the only

1145
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,630
thing that I used so you've got to make

1146
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,099
sure that you're protecting your

1147
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:43,750
employees and your employees know that

1148
00:44:42,099 --> 00:44:45,609
you're not trying to stifle their

1149
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,190
freedoms you're not trying to stifle

1150
00:44:45,609 --> 00:44:49,598
their expressions but you've got to let

1151
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,950
them know that they're being targeted

1152
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:54,609
that way that those are the things that

1153
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:57,129
they're being targeted with it's like so

1154
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:58,810
the next thing is phishing is one of the

1155
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,420
leading causes of compromise with your

1156
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:05,200
employees really take it seriously how

1157
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:08,020
many people understand that clicking on

1158
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,578
a link with a company computer on an

1159
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,570
email that they're not familiar with is

1160
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:15,020
a bad thing

1161
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:17,330
understand it not me we still get this

1162
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,610
it's still being done and one of the

1163
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:21,049
biggest examples of that it's like it's

1164
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:22,940
always I think it's always going to be

1165
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:24,470
target right it's like it's always I

1166
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,400
mean no offense to target but it's its

1167
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:32,540
target they were not even the original

1168
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:35,690
cause of the compromise their third

1169
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:38,120
party communique vendor their HVAC

1170
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:40,430
company was hit with a phishing attack

1171
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,880
I'm sorry the CEO of the company said

1172
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:46,520
they were hit with a PT I'd say we got

1173
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,720
hit by a PT you know say cuz that's what

1174
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,790
you got to tell your shareholders and

1175
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,500
stockholders as I know as a PT it was

1176
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:53,600
like oh my gosh was like the abt got us

1177
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:58,340
it's like and and everybody wants you to

1178
00:45:53,600 --> 00:46:00,350
think that a PT stands for what advanced

1179
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,600
persistent threats

1180
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,640
it sounds very threatening okay it's

1181
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:08,210
like in persistent it's like no that's

1182
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:13,060
not what it stands for 99% of the time

1183
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:16,280
it stands for adequate fishing technique

1184
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:18,710
period okay don't let anybody tell you

1185
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,330
something different it's like someone in

1186
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:22,130
that company clicked on a link got

1187
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:24,140
compromised and use that trust

1188
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:27,830
relationship to take over their networks

1189
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:30,109
and they lost over 300 million dollars I

1190
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,069
mean even in euros that's gotta add up

1191
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:32,480
to something when you get into the

1192
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:34,340
hundreds of millions and mostly all

1193
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,500
currencies it starts from eating big

1194
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,530
money right it's like that was a lot of

1195
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,850
money so that was probably like 20

1196
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,220
million euros but still whatever it

1197
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:45,020
doesn't matter it was a lot of money so

1198
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,640
that's an issue that you have to make

1199
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,490
sure your employees are understanding do

1200
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,640
you let your delivery drivers wreck

1201
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:55,779
their van

1202
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:58,299
every month or every quarter and still

1203
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,910
be okay with that

1204
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,970
because they're jeopardizing the cost of

1205
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,529
a van that cost maybe a hundred thousand

1206
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:07,470
euros since I have one especially fancy

1207
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:10,380
ones right

1208
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,299
so why if you don't tolerate that from

1209
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,800
your employees to your drivers that's

1210
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,930
who that's part of their job is to use

1211
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,360
that equipment properly safely and

1212
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,399
effectively then why are you letting

1213
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,720
your users get away from constantly

1214
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,850
clicking links that are jeopardizing

1215
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,830
your company that you can lose millions

1216
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:27,720
off of

1217
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,610
you need to make sure in your

1218
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,310
environment they understand that

1219
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,320
clicking links have repercussions that

1220
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:36,150
there are consequences for that kind of

1221
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,240
behavior it's like I'm not saying you

1222
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:41,580
fire all of them at first it's like you

1223
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:43,500
have to educate them you have to show

1224
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,120
them what they can do to protect

1225
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,590
themselves how to start thinking

1226
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,770
critically when they get suspicious

1227
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:51,120
emails that's on you

1228
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:52,590
but if Bob and accounting and no offense

1229
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,690
to Bob's four people in accounting but

1230
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:58,110
if the a bob an accounting keeps

1231
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:01,200
clicking on those emails every quarter

1232
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:03,450
or every month then bob needs a serious

1233
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,799
talking to it's like he's not helping

1234
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,210
your company he may be one of those

1235
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,020
insider threats that you just didn't

1236
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:12,960
realize so you need to educate them it's

1237
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:15,150
like another thing and once again it's

1238
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,560
like I'm I literally I'm not

1239
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:18,270
deliberately picking on the US but they

1240
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,390
have so many good examples of how to be

1241
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:24,060
stupid or bad it's security but here's

1242
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:26,100
this this just was from last week the

1243
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:27,810
NSA improperly over collected call

1244
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,170
detail records for a second time last

1245
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,420
year

1246
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:32,010
documents show renewing privacy concerns

1247
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,350
about their surveillance program due to

1248
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:37,350
expire in December and have you ever

1249
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:38,549
noticed like with the CIA or NSA or

1250
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:40,790
Facebook or any of these other

1251
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,930
collective agencies they never

1252
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:45,390
accidentally make a mistake where they

1253
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:47,220
take less data it's like have you ever

1254
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,859
gotten an email from Facebook saying oh

1255
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,509
I'm sorry due to our recent upgrades we

1256
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,400
actually made all your things more

1257
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:55,380
private and harder to be seen by

1258
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,480
everybody sorry about that no it's

1259
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,580
always oh sorry we changed your privacy

1260
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,380
settings everybody including your ex

1261
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:03,529
from 12th grade gets to see your profile

1262
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,000
now you may want to fix that eventually

1263
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:08,100
it's like so I've never worked but this

1264
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,920
is a key thing though this is a key

1265
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:14,100
concern and what it is is are you

1266
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:16,470
vetting your security systems how many

1267
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:19,049
people send from the security chaos

1268
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:22,640
security team do you send someone in

1269
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:22,640
your company a virus

1270
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,868
are you doing that you should be doing

1271
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:32,500
that at least once a quarter

1272
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:34,960
send a malicious program to an internal

1273
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,460
machine that is you know can be

1274
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,230
segmented off of network it's like chase

1275
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,059
I just I just I just I'm gonna check my

1276
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:42,519
Twitter laters like Jason said to infect

1277
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:43,359
our network and stuff and no that's not

1278
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,839
what I'm saying

1279
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:49,690
I'm saying test your security products

1280
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:52,410
in a real-world environment don't just

1281
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:56,710
assume because the sales engineer said

1282
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:58,149
you're done that you're done it's like

1283
00:49:56,710 --> 00:50:00,430
you know many times I've gone and I've

1284
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:02,430
seen an IDs installation because

1285
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:05,368
idealized IDS's are awesome right

1286
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:07,480
intrusion detection systems are amazing

1287
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,510
until you start getting all the hits

1288
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,100
from the signatures

1289
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:14,010
because how many people I've seen

1290
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:17,040
companies put a inside install an IDs

1291
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:21,270
system put a default signature based in

1292
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:22,200
there and they're like you know it's

1293
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,930
like I don't know what to do with all

1294
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:28,140
this and so what do they do they just

1295
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:31,440
accept accept accept accept exceed

1296
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:33,029
anymore you should be fine-tuning those

1297
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,190
machines and you should be testing them

1298
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,470
you should be able to make sure they've

1299
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,600
you sent a malicious email but with a

1300
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,368
package from the external area and it

1301
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,470
goes into an email into your company

1302
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:45,240
that it's been vetted that some kind of

1303
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:47,939
alert goes off or that it gets stopped

1304
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,529
altogether you need to be able to verify

1305
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,780
those things you don't just go by what

1306
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:54,000
the cells engineer says you need to test

1307
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:56,010
those machines you need to test those

1308
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,390
security procedures you need to make

1309
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:59,340
sure that they're working you don't put

1310
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:01,470
an anti-virus in and hope for the best

1311
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,359
you know is like well we keep our

1312
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:06,540
updated our sutures updated we're good

1313
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:07,440
no they have to be tested and make sure

1314
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:11,259
that they're working the way they're

1315
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:13,420
supposed to it's like

1316
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,670
and then the last last time I'm almost

1317
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,900
done it's like so so I went real early

1318
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,160
for the keynote and I'm going really

1319
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,190
long for the other one so I'm trying to

1320
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,770
balance it all out it's like so once

1321
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,510
again and I'm gonna beat this horse till

1322
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,920
it's like it comes back to life okay

1323
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:28,000
it's like snot I'm not even kidding a

1324
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,960
dead horse now I feel like I'm

1325
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,870
resuscitating it okay it's like always

1326
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,880
educate and empower your users they're

1327
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:39,759
your best line of defense and we're

1328
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,740
hardly using them it's like we keep

1329
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,710
trying to buy the really cool blinky

1330
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:45,910
boxes to protect our users you know and

1331
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,020
I mean the blinky boxes have gotten

1332
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,089
cooler I mean they've got blue lights

1333
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:52,420
now instead of red lights I mean they're

1334
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:55,240
way nicer but stop trying to get

1335
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,890
technology to protect your users start

1336
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:59,560
understanding that you need your users

1337
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:01,180
to protect your technology and if you

1338
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,640
don't have that you don't really have a

1339
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,410
good security plan it's like so make

1340
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,569
sure that you're utilizing them and that

1341
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:08,830
they know they need to be utilized make

1342
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:11,140
sure they're they understand they're

1343
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:13,720
part of the team not part of the threat

1344
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:17,009
and treat them that way and you'll have

1345
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:17,009
a better program

1346
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:30,260
y'all think I'm joking

1347
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,259
I am done

1348
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:41,930
are there any questions

1349
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:44,960
oh I love you too

1350
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,190
hugs later and I will be here for a long

1351
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,350
time so think you want to come up

1352
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:50,450
afterwards and get a hug or talk I mean

1353
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:52,430
I'm always approachable please do so

1354
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,569
that's that's the reason why I come to

1355
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:55,609
these conferences I think I said that

1356
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:58,040
earlier it's like it's the meet and

1357
00:52:55,610 --> 00:53:00,910
greet it's like a network is there

1358
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,910
anybody have any questions

1359
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:08,630
all right oh wait here we go

1360
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:10,910
very much where do you put boundaries or

1361
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:13,339
borders between hacking in social and

1362
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,710
private social life of people and try to

1363
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:18,288
hack into the companies I mean like I'm

1364
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:20,390
not going to lockpick someone a house

1365
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:22,970
just because I want to have maybe

1366
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:24,859
probably that's company files in there I

1367
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:26,419
mean just to know whether you put the

1368
00:53:24,859 --> 00:53:28,730
button where's the line yeah and that's

1369
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:30,380
a good question you people talk about

1370
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:31,730
that they're saying it's like we well

1371
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,559
you're going after the users on their

1372
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:38,450
private moments and their price it's not

1373
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:41,239
private its public it's like I I am a

1374
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:43,368
bad guy I'm they're trying to rob you

1375
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:45,529
we've already established my moral

1376
00:53:43,369 --> 00:53:47,359
boundaries right I'm trying to I have

1377
00:53:45,529 --> 00:53:49,339
never been mugged anywhere where it's

1378
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,630
like I'm really sorry to do this you

1379
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:51,920
know it's like I mean ignore the gun I

1380
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,390
mean it's overkill I mean no pun

1381
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,680
intended but I need your wallet and your

1382
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:56,450
credit cards and everything else I mean

1383
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,460
I hate this has to happen you know this

1384
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:59,868
way it's it's very awkward for both of

1385
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,130
us is that can you just keep you don't

1386
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:04,420
get mugged like that unless you're in

1387
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:07,279
Canada right it's like no one does that

1388
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:09,289
I'm there I've broken into a building

1389
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:11,210
before in a wheelchair I've already

1390
00:54:09,289 --> 00:54:13,789
established I'm a horrible person

1391
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:15,999
trying to steal from you it's like judge

1392
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:19,099
me all you want I'm there to get paid

1393
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:21,200
it's like so I am going to go over like

1394
00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:23,839
a bad guy and I'm gonna look at your

1395
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,538
social media things to find ways to get

1396
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,999
in to find ways to make it sound more

1397
00:54:26,539 --> 00:54:30,559
convincing that I'm one of your friends

1398
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:33,078
to assume the identity of your friends

1399
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,880
say hey it was great going to that party

1400
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:37,220
that we went to last Saturday night it's

1401
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,099
like I hope you had fun too by the way I

1402
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:41,689
found this story click on this link here

1403
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:43,489
it's like that's how that works because

1404
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:45,349
they do remember going to that place

1405
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:46,999
with that party they don't remember the

1406
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:49,400
fact that they posted it publicly on

1407
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:51,769
Facebook and that person also checked in

1408
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,239
to the same location it's like I was I

1409
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:55,939
literally showed him one of my examples

1410
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:59,599
of a person who worked for a bank in the

1411
00:54:55,940 --> 00:55:01,400
US and on her public profile we were not

1412
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,440
friends and trust me after this talk we

1413
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,109
were never going to be friends it's like

1414
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:09,140
on her public profile that anybody could

1415
00:55:06,109 --> 00:55:10,920
see was her phone number and physical

1416
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:13,950
address

1417
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:16,920
the very next slide in that presentation

1418
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:18,060
was a picture of her house now don't

1419
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,530
think I'm creepy I didn't go to her

1420
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:22,350
house and take a picture that that's I

1421
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,450
have limits okay it was from Google

1422
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:27,420
Streetview but it was still a picture of

1423
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:30,660
her house people in America are still

1424
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:33,660
being kidnapped after they closed up the

1425
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,430
bank and held overnight so they can open

1426
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,149
it up because of the times it is a thing

1427
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:38,669
of the vols

1428
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:40,080
and they're being held overnight to open

1429
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:43,740
up and rob the bank the next morning

1430
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:45,240
that still occurs in the US and that's

1431
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,189
what she was opening herself up to but

1432
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:50,100
she didn't see that because she didn't

1433
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:52,350
understand that online activity and

1434
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,210
things that you say online can't

1435
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:56,819
translate to real world threats and

1436
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:59,910
that's what we're there for we're not

1437
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:01,290
there for just tonight beyond we're just

1438
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:02,850
gonna scan this I'm gonna do this range

1439
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:04,610
we don't want to go to you know too hard

1440
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:07,529
because that might hurt their feelings

1441
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,750
I've established I'm trying to rob you

1442
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,070
it's like anything that I can do to rob

1443
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:13,200
you that's not going to get me in more

1444
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:15,480
trouble and a criminal doesn't have that

1445
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,649
kind of leeway it's like I have some

1446
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,060
boundaries and we're like yeah that's a

1447
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,860
little bit too much for me even okay

1448
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:22,440
it's like a criminal doesn't have that

1449
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:24,240
so the employees need to know it's not

1450
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,860
about their freedoms it's what

1451
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,959
information they're giving that can be

1452
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,150
used against them from someone who's

1453
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:32,760
trying to steal from not just them but

1454
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:34,630
from their company is there any other

1455
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:38,920
questions

1456
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:41,680
yes make it short please soon we are

1457
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:45,130
technical team will eat what a turnover

1458
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:48,578
just a little question about what's what

1459
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:50,700
ow what are your thoughts about the

1460
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:53,829
staff expects when doing a physical

1461
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:57,578
intrusion in in in buildings or in

1462
00:56:53,829 --> 00:57:00,489
company to avoid the cameras or to avoid

1463
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:03,900
too many witnesses from the company oh I

1464
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:08,079
do not try to avoid anything it's like

1465
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:09,940
my whole one of the best things that you

1466
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,259
can do when you're doing something

1467
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:16,269
really evil is to not act really evil

1468
00:57:13,259 --> 00:57:18,309
it's like when I go into a location it's

1469
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:20,200
like I walk mother I'm like I own this

1470
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:22,180
place what's up you know it's like I'm

1471
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,788
going straight it and every location I

1472
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:26,680
do that I immediately walk in the door

1473
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:28,809
and I just start walking like I know

1474
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,788
exactly where I'm going and it trust me

1475
00:57:28,809 --> 00:57:32,019
I'm not cool it's led to some

1476
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:33,999
embarrassing places there was one time

1477
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:36,669
in Cyprus where I walked in this branch

1478
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:39,399
and I'm like walked in turned around the

1479
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:40,420
corner and there wasn't a stairwell that

1480
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:41,799
I thought there would be there because

1481
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,769
the way the building was out it was

1482
00:57:41,799 --> 00:57:45,660
actually a blank wall and I'm like this

1483
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:48,008
is awkward

1484
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,598
cuz now I gotta walk back to everybody

1485
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:51,279
in the lobby and they're like what was

1486
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,440
he doing over there by the wall it's

1487
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:55,390
like I don't know it's like and I got

1488
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,729
caught one time in a company because I

1489
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:00,609
did that I walked purposely to the back

1490
00:57:57,729 --> 00:58:03,038
of the the all these glass offices so

1491
00:58:00,609 --> 00:58:05,680
everybody saw me walking to these empty

1492
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:08,440
offices where nobody was and I'm like oh

1493
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,558
I should have stopped at that guy

1494
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,920
so you don't try to avoid eye contact

1495
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:16,509
you don't try to avoid cameras because

1496
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,420
once again you go into the assumption

1497
00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:21,390
that you're you're robbers don't if

1498
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:23,829
Robert actually thought about the odds

1499
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:25,390
they wouldn't be robbers we ought to

1500
00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:27,489
understand criminals aren't the best

1501
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:29,680
critical thinking process people right

1502
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:31,660
because they all think they're going to

1503
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,859
get away with it they all have like I

1504
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,729
mean how many times he's like oh we're

1505
00:58:32,859 --> 00:58:36,160
gonna do this really

1506
00:58:33,729 --> 00:58:37,359
and it was like acne hour right it's

1507
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,279
like it's like but they all think

1508
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:41,229
they're gonna get away with it so that's

1509
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:43,809
what you try to do it's like I smile I

1510
00:58:41,229 --> 00:58:45,549
laugh I joke I can't be a good bad guy

1511
00:58:43,809 --> 00:58:47,440
look how adorable I am it's like I'm not

1512
00:58:45,549 --> 00:58:48,049
trying to steal from you it's like and

1513
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,910
those are the

1514
00:58:48,049 --> 00:58:51,890
threats it's like people acting

1515
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,839
suspicious or shifty it's like people

1516
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:54,319
are afraid of that people know about

1517
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,900
that

1518
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:58,249
if it feels nervous if I go right up to

1519
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,509

countermeasures that I have in my bag of

1527
00:59:12,529 --> 00:59:16,880
tricks is when I'm walking by someone

1528
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:19,130
and they look a little bit suspicious my

1529
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:23,150
very first reaction hey what's up and
