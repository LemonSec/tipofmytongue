c-3po you the video show is fake news

58
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:53,970
right but it shows how the CIA created a

59
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,100
technology called Facebook

60
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:03,310

2004 everyone knows Mark Zuckerberg

64
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:22,270
launched Facebook in January 2004 the

65
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:26,630
United States Defense Department closed

66
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:29,930
a project called life log

67
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:34,430
what is life log life log is a program

68
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,590

69
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,290
all the pictures about you tells

70
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:43,510
everyone where you went where you're

71
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:49,000
going where you'll meet up what you like

72
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:53,820

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,840

like

77
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,570
the life log program closed

78
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,450
two days before Facebook was launched

79
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:19,049
does Facebook collect all the same

80
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,390
information as this program that the

81
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:25,669
Defense Department had been working on

82
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:28,849
for many years yes

83
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,628
is it reasonable to say that Facebook

84
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:36,349
which was created in the same town that

85
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:39,490
the program life log was worked on and

86
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,490
created in

87
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:47,790
is it the same did the u.s.

88
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,580
just hand the information to Mark

89
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,639
Zuckerberg

90
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,560
let him create the program called life

91
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,070
log

92
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,620
we're going

93
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,840
look at some of the things that have

94
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,370
happened and this is so everyone

95
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,130
understands this is only the US

96
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,470

97
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,420

it's 100% effort zero execution okay

102
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,249
I'm sorry so these are the places that I

103
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,830
worked for and if you look there's a

104
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:56,529
picture here people see the movie the

105
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,409
men that stare at goats you've seen that

106
00:06:56,529 --> 00:07:03,490
movie where they used their the power of

107
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:06,729
the brain to affect the goat this was a

108
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:10,029
CIA program part of a program called MK

109
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:12,389
ULTRA it was turned over to the US

110
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:15,210
Department of Defense

111
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:18,689
the unit that is represented there is

112
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:22,258
the first Earth battalion military unit

113
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:25,969
that used psychology to affect other

114
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,969
people and animals

115
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,200
I'm too old I didn't work in that unit

116
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:37,380
but I worked in a unit that did similar

117
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:40,500
things because I said US NSA I have to

118
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:44,610
say that I have a fish Elaine that

119
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,420
everything I say is not NSA and not US

120
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,420
government opinion

121
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:56,500
well that way I don't go to jail so Bob

122
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,390
Dylan made a very interesting concept

123
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,670
about the brain and what we can do with

124
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:07,010
the brain and we've learned over many

125
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:12,910
years that the brain is the key and is

126
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,909
most vulnerable to external influence

127
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,020
young

128
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:22,110
I learned that the Soviet Union was very

129
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,349
bad and you can see the things that are

130
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,990
said here

131
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,600
these are terrible things if you don't

132
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:34,039
agree we can surgically mutilate your

133
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:36,200
brain individuals the

134
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:39,500
most important

135
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,700
that's not true we can control our

136
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:46,480
generals and we can control our armies

137
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:52,670
with electronic stimulation in the brain

138
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:54,440
this is very bad I think but it wasn't

139
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:58,040
necessarily the Soviets that said that

140
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,520
it was a u.s. doctor and he was working

141
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,969
on the CIA program and the comments that

142
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,669
this doctor made

143
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:11,979
were in testimony to the US Congress the

144
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:16,020
program had just been discovered nobody

145
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:18,490
knew about it outside of the CIA

146
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,250
they knew the CIA was doing interesting

147
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,650
things and strange things you go to the

148
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,060
movies right you go to the movies you're

149
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,930
watching a movie and all of a sudden

150
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,880
everybody wants to purchase Coca Cola

151
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,699
because they put the message in the

152
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,089
movie and it made your brain think and

153
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,950
you would go get the soda and for many

154
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,210
years we said no no that's not happening

155
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,330
that didn't happen

156
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:44,819
well it did happen they were doing that

157
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,809
testing

158
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:53,368
and they did affect people that way here

159
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:57,029
dr. Delgado believed that it was very

160
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:59,009
important to control the brain of all

161
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,350
soldiers and all armies traveling around

162
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:03,779
the world and he believed that it was

163
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,420
also important to control the brains of

164
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:10,070
all the citizens

165
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,069
there would be no problems

166
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:17,460
and who was this guy well he had come

167
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,830
from Spain and he started practicing in

168
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:23,850
the United States he became the senior

169
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:26,340
psychiatrist of Yale University and he

170
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,760
implanted the first brain chips into a

171
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:33,780
monkey on the left you can see the

172
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,780
monkey before the external affecting of

173
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,120
the brain on the right if you look at

174
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,980
the face of the monkey the monkey is

175
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,830
very agitated

176
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:50,310
he sent ultra-low frequency at two Hertz

177
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,310
the monkey

178
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,690
he also did the same with a bowl

179
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,970
he had a bowl charge at him with a brain

180
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,970
implant

181
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:08,990
can get the video off of the YouTube

182
00:11:06,269 --> 00:11:13,400
when the bull got within 5 feet of him

183
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:16,460
he pushed the button the jamming button

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,250
and the Bulls stopped and ran away he

185
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,939
did this three times

186
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,100
to prove that you can affect and

187
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:28,540
manipulate behavior through brain

188
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:32,769
control this was a direct brain control

189
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,769
not remote access to the brain

190
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:40,680
where did he get the idea from that well

191
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:44,329
back in 1934 there was some research

192
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,258
completed by doctors Chaffee and Lake

193
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:49,050
where they attempted to manipulate

194
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:51,800
people's brains

195
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,800
is one of the victims

196
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,740
have her whole head shaved

197
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,260
cut into her skull

198
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:04,010
implanted a device in the skull that

199
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,990
reacted to the ultra-low frequency radio

200
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,330
waves that they were using

201
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,600
do certain things and she reacted

202
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:16,110
accordingly she did everything that they

203
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,000
programmed her to do she did everything

204
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,000
they programmed her to say

205
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,570
as I mentioned these tests were

206
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:31,540
conducted under a program called MKULTRA

207
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:34,040
there were almost 200 sub tests that

208
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,870
were included

209
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,870
of the records were destroyed

210
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,610
seventy-three

211
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,730
of the MKULTRA program were ordered

212
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,730
destroyed by the director of the CIA

213
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,190
activity was illegal

214
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,829
they said that they couldn't have the

215
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,939
records found out

216
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:00,789
but there were

217
00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:04,689
thousand pages of records just a few

218
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:06,848
boxes that were found where some of the

219
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:10,689
information from the program was put

220
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:14,069
back together the information from this

221
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:19,709
program only covers a very little bit

222
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:22,889
but it covers some of the tests

223
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:25,679
experiments that were done

224
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:27,790
and the research findings that were

225
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,980
completed

226
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,530
other programs will only only know by

227
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:36,930
name and we'll never know exactly what

228
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,930
they were or what they included

229
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,139
one of the programs was called operation

230
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,139
midnight climax

231
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:53,230
this is an attempt to influence the

232
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:56,070
brain by giving LSD to businessmen

233
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,530
only in a brothel

234
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,510
and they videotaped all the businessmen

235
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,780
after

236
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:06,060
they had taken the LSD

237
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,240
so when you take LSD you don't know what

238
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,739
happens after right

239
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,980
so they blackmailed all these people

240
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:17,550
they raised funds

241
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:21,360
and they found that this program was so

242
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:23,270
successful that the CIA used it on their

243
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,590
bosses

244
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,590
and the military

245
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,560
LSD to their bosses they gave LSD to the

246
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,520
military and they showed them the video

247
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,520
of what happened after

248
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,759
the brothel

249
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:44,638
and guess what the CIA's funding went up

250
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,100
very high because they didn't want the

251
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,839
videos to get out they offered the CIA

252
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,839
war money for this program

253
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,360
needless to say it's not even close to

254
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,720
being ethical

255
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:05,490
some of the victims were children that

256
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:08,640
were routinely sexually abused

257
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:12,440
to create a mindset

258
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,439
that could be manipulated by the CIA

259
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,430
how many people here would offer their

260
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,430
children

261
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,630
program where their children were

262
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,320
continually raped or abused so that you

263
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,320
could test something

264
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,920
they did this with no parent consent

265
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,240
they

266
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,240
without any parent knowledge

267
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,860
the program this program ran for ten

268
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,750
years

269
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,850
where they did this to these children

270
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,680
and we don't know how many children were

271
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,540
involved but we do know that

272
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,519
consistent sexual abuse

273
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:56,670
as a psychological effect on people we

274
00:15:53,519 --> 00:16:01,430
see that from just clinical records now

275
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,430
but back then it was an experiment

276
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:09,180
you can see the Unabomber back in the

277
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:13,380
States there was a man Ted Kaczynski he

278
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,550
worked at MIT and Harvard and he was a

279
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,330
student at Harvard

280
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,010
he eventually ended up sending bombs in

281
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,320
the mail too many people around the

282
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,709
states they called him the Unabomber and

283
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:30,880
the FBI could not find him and he had

284
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:35,459
been the subject of some of these tests

285
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:39,040
that the CIA calls tests he had been

286
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:43,209
consistently left with the brainwaves

287
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,250
being manipulated the whole time he

288
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:48,579
ended up putting it the idea of the tin

289
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:51,040
hat the tinfoil hat came from him he put

290
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,000
a garbage can over his head so they

291
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,930
couldn't affect his brain

292
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,389
one of the doctors Fred Olsen Frank

293
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,900
Olson excuse me he went and he killed

294
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:04,809
himself

295
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,849
no he didn't kill himself it was

296
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:09,430
murdered by the CIA so he wouldn't talk

297
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:11,919
he was going to talk and he was thrown

298
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,949
out of a window up at Fort Dietrich in

299
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,870
Maryland so he wouldn't expose the rest

300
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:23,290
of the MKULTRA programs that were being

301
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:24,899
conducted at the time here's a list I

302
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:27,938
know it's very small it's hard to read

303
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,440
but it covers some of the MKULTRA

304
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,130
programs that we don't have any

305
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,130
information on

306
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:39,260
material which caused the victim to age

307
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:43,280
faster or slower materials which promote

308
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,280
intoxicating effects of alcohol

309
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,750
did you ever wonder where the rape drugs

310
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,750
came from

311
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,720
temporary or permanent brain damage and

312
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,720
loss of memory

313
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:03,240
a side note some of the programs in

314
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:05,530
MKULTRA used magnetism and

315
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,870
neutralization of magnetic fields

316
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,309
there's a program that the US

317
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:14,320
government's working on right now and

318
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:15,970
the UK also that do the same thing so I

319
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,389
don't know that they ever ended the

320
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,390
program

321
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:28,870
one of the programs in MKULTRA

322
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:30,850
attached words to radio waves the word

323
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:34,570
was embedded in the radio wave and the

324
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:36,699
person was able without hearing it or

325
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:40,320
knowing that they heard it to repeat the

326
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,320
phrase back to the tester

327
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,650
hello how are you

328
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:49,179
hello how are you I don't know how that

329
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,350
happened but I just felt like I had to

330
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,350
tell you hello how are you

331
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,480
it was called the perfect weapon they

332
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,790
could make people's minds evaporate make

333
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,390
their brain evaporate all their memories

334
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,389
all their thoughts

335
00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:11,309
and it was all approved back in 1956

336
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:19,350
I know everybody's a little unhappy

337
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,350
right now

338
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,230
slide

339
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,160
come on is there a mathematician here at

340
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,160
all

341
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:32,740
nobody okay

342
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:35,080
negative one is an imaginary number okay

343
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,179
there you go so are there mind control

344
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,178
things available now yes you can get

345
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:42,730
them commercially right you can sit at

346
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,990
your computer

347
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,490
you can control your mouse you can

348
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,650
control your keyboard and you don't have

349
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:52,679
to touch anything just put the headset

350
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,679
on where did this technology come from

351
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,520
also you can use brain implants it helps

352
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:05,620
people that have paralysis

353
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,620
or other issues to move

354
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,249
where did this technology come from

355
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:18,120
dr. Delgado actually ever stop

356
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:20,870
the experiments he was doing

357
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,870
I don't think so

358
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:27,559
I don't think so because now the u.s.

359
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:30,549
Pentagon is planning on putting implants

360
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,549
in soldiers brains

361
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:38,169
did the program ever end like they said

362
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,170
it did in 1975 or did it continue on

363
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,260
how are you able to defeat how are you

364
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,350
able to control an army that has brain

365
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,649
implants

366
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:52,759
100% controlled external to their own

367
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,758
personal feelings

368
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,310
what are the effects of hacking

369
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,310
something like this

370
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,070
imagine

371
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,870
the kingdom of Liechtenstein hacked the

372
00:21:04,049 --> 00:21:09,500
US Army today and took control of all

373
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,500
their soldiers

374
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,899
this is what you get

375
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:20,020
when you have somebody

376
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,760
it's the same soldier this is what you

377
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,810
get when you have every citizen that is

378
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,810
controlled in the same way

379
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,059
our cloned

380
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:36,640
is the same people are the same as the

381
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:36,639
soldiers and this is what the CIA found

382
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:43,419
called silent sound that was used in the

383
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:48,159
Iraq war in 1991 against the Iraqis that

384
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:50,860
made them complicit

385
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:53,230
not want to fight which is how the US

386
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,129
military rolled through the Republican

387
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,130
Guard so quickly

388
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,830
the radio waves that were used with the

389
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:05,540
messages that were used in this program

390
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,540
neutralized the Iraqi Defense Forces

391
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,870
this comes out

392
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,870
the CIA

393
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,729
that was done this is an expansion from

394
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,020
that

395
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,790
this happened in 1991 tell me tell me

396
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,160
that they stopped doing the train the

397
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:25,159
testing they couldn't

398
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:31,789
they stopped but now the DARPA the

399
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:36,169
Defense Advanced Research Program

400
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:38,330
activity has taken over all of these

401
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:40,749
programs that the CIA said they stopped

402
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,749
doing

403
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:47,140
it includes brain initiative which is a

404
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,020
complete mapping and understanding to

405
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,230
technically manipulate and support the

406
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,230
brain

407
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,760
as in everything else there are dual use

408
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,070
technologies you can use it for good and

409
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,670
you can use it for bad if I can use

410
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,500
something for good I can use it for bad

411
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:07,550
another presentation I give I show how

412
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,140
we use nanotechnology to deliver a

413
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,340
neurotransmitter to help people move

414
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,080
their hands

415
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,370
so if you

416
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:21,039
say you have Parkinson's and you can't

417
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:23,350
move this technology will allow you to

418
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,990
move your hand

419
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,918
on the other hand if we load something

420
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,200
else in there

421
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,200
I can paralyze your nervous system

422
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:39,930
so can this be bad

423
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,178
very bad because they haven't stopped

424
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:47,530
yet there's a program that addresses

425
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:52,240
neuropsychological illnesses

426
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:54,420
psychiatric disorders bipolar psychotic

427
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,420
behavior

428
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,950
to stop those behaviors with this

429
00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,789
training with this testing

430
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:05,650
however

431
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:08,470
I can stop it in someone who has it

432
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:11,400
can I not create it in someone who

433
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,400
doesn't have it

434
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:18,399
restoring active memory this goes back

435
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,890
to the previous research that the CIA

436
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,570
conducted where they wiped out the

437
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,130
memory

438
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:26,770
they're saying that they can now restore

439
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:31,210
memory in people that have lost their

440
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:34,360
memory Alzheimer's patients but why is a

441
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:36,370
defense organization why is the US

442
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:40,679
intelligence community creating a

443
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,679
medical answer

444
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:47,470
surely in my opinion it cannot be for

445
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,470
medical research

446
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,370
there's others here micro physiological

447
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,820
systems where they use different types

448
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:59,178
of technologies to manipulate your body

449
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,070
internally

450
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:03,589
control through the brain controlled

451
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:05,749
through the neurological system but

452
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:09,129
again it all stems off of those original

453
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:09,129
tests that were done

454
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,160
as a hacker

455
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,950
most of us don't even

456
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,010
consider

457
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:22,460
the body is so easily hacked how you can

458
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:25,250
manipulate the body we can consider a

459
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:27,179
prosthetic because it's a mechanical

460
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:30,059
piece

461
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:32,309
but the human machine interface the

462
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:37,399
point where that prosthetic crosses over

463
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:37,399
and uses the neurological system

464
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:45,270
a gateway into the rest of the body and

465
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:48,020
allows you to manipulate digitally the

466
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,020
brain itself

467
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:57,379
recent research shows that there are

468
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:58,640
ways to collect information from someone

469
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,840
who has a brain that's messed up

470
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,530
something the CIA found out 45 years ago

471
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,530
but didn't share with us

472
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,929
and there's dozens others

473
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,250
we don't want to be

474
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,539
the answers we want to be able to

475
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,269
provide the solution

476
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:22,429
and in order to provide the solution we

477
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:25,509
have to understand the full spectrum of

478
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:25,509
what's happened

479
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:32,350
the CIA ran these programs for almost 30

480
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,350
years nobody knew about it

481
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,900
there's many many many others

482
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,390
they tested biological weapons they

483
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,740
tested fungicides they tested parasites

484
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:46,470
and it was all too

485
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:49,710
helped interrogation procedures or have

486
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:52,760
their people be able to resist soviet

487
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,760
interrogation procedures

488
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:58,409
but this technology has gone and gotten

489
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,100
way out of control we look at computers

490
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,960
now

491
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,139
we look at the networks involved with

492
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,139
them

493
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,370
and we're sure that there's a solution

494
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:12,970
there somewhere there's a way to help

495
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:17,070
fix it can we fix it 100% no can we fix

496
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,070
it 80% 90% probably

497
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,000
you considered that the computer is not

498
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,000
important at all

499
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:33,010
we take and hit somebody or create

500
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,529
a magnetic field that forces your brain

501
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:38,210
to do what we want you are legitimately

502
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:41,900
doing exactly

503
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:45,550
what the adversary wants you to do

504
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,550
everything you do on that computer

505
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:54,520
network administrator's you have heard

506
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,520
access to everything come on

507
00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,060
there's no way to stop this unless you

508
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,830
understand and you're where

509
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:05,870
that there are problems out there that

510
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,870
are outside of our field of expertise

511
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,760
Aref realm for a long time before I got

512
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:15,080
into the digital stuff my boss likes to

513
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,879
call it digital stuff

514
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,689
because it contains many different

515
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:19,689
aspects

516
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,210
we are the people

517
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,210
make a difference

518
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,139
but please remember

519
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:34,140
please remember because by the time I

520
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,429
leave here and by the time

521
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,650
Jason leaves here later on and all the

522
00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:40,210
other speakers that come up here you're

523
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,520
gonna forget almost everything you saw

524
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,789
here within the first month

525
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:48,809
and you're not going to remember it

526
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:48,809
that is normal

527
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,600
the important thing is that you can cram

528
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,950
for a college exam and at the time you

529
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,449
cram for it you'll remember almost

530
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:02,360
everything but when it comes to this

531
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,179
it'll be forgotten

532
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,820
so please

533
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:08,379
telling you don't forget remember that

534
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,330
these technologies are out there and

535
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:12,668
when you hear about something that

536
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,189
happens in the RF realm or something

537
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:17,980
that happens in the digital realm that

538
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:21,580
looks almost impossible just remember

539
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:25,059
it's not impossible odds are it's

540
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:27,720
already been done somewhere and we just

541
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:27,720
don't know about it

542
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,200
thank you

543
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,158
any questions at all

544
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,710
I'd be afraid to ask questions too

545
00:29:49,660 --> 00:30:02,309
No okay no problem are you sure okay

546
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:02,309
okay thank you thank you
