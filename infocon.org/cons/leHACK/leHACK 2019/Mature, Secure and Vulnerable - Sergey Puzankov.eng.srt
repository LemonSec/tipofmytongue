1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:09,660
dear friend IAP who great lineup of

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,349
Spiker is keeping you all engaged and

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,120
curious continuing juice we have to the

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,330
honor to welcome an all-star

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,288
telecommunications security expert I bet

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:25,369
all of you have already heard of 2fa and

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,920
of course I love you know all of you

8
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:31,349
know why using SMS as a second factor is

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,760
rubbish but do you know why

10
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,430
who next picture Sergei know all about

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,079
the vulnerability of mobile network and

12
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,079
will be sharing them with earth

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,620
hello Le Coq nice to meet you

14
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:30,890
let me introduce myself my name is

15
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,110
Sergey Poussin cough I work at positive

16
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:39,290
technologies as a telecom security

17
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:41,930
expert later I worked at telecom

18
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:46,210
equipment vendor as a support engineer I

19
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:49,850
worked as quality engineer in a big

20
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:53,809
mobile multinational mobile operator and

21
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,119
at my current position I research

22
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,420
signaling protocols from a security

23
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:01,899
point of view sequel 'nor abilities

24
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:05,030
contribute all my findings to

25
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:09,770
non-commercial organizations like jsm a

26
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:15,190
and ITU and also I share my knowledge is

27
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:19,160
at different security conferences so

28
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:23,209
object of my talk is SSL and what the

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,160
seven is as seven is set of telephony

30
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:28,489
protocols this is not one protocol to us

31
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,950
a number of them that primarily intended

32
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:34,720
to set up and release telephony calls

33
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:40,880
but later when mobile telephony appeared

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:44,420
as a seven is used to process SMS

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,700
messages to provide subscriber mobility

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,589
roaming capabilities and some other

37
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:54,070
services related to mobile networks and

38
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:57,320
Elementor elementary portion in ss7

39
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:59,780
signaling is a message or a signaling

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:05,769
message I will use this term throughout

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:09,680
all the presentation when I will say

42
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:12,079
message that means not SSL SMS message

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:17,360
it means signaling message or as a seven

44
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:20,900
message as a seven messages or SSN

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,260
traffic goes only within

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:28,370
operate premises between equipment

47
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,310
between bit between network elements not

48
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:34,790
on the user side and the same traffic

49
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:39,439
goes between mobile or other

50
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:43,780
operators nowadays SSL is used in fixed

51
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:48,530
telephony in mobile telephony of two and

52
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:51,409
3G sects second the social generations

53
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:56,780
like GSM and UMTS and foreign

54
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:59,569
interconnection with LTE networks so

55
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:05,030
there is an opinion that SSL is an

56
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:07,970
obsolete technology tomorrow or the day

57
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,840
after tomorrow all we will use for and

58
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,150
5g mobile devices but if we look at the

59
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,298
official jessimae statistics we are

60
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,000
somewhere here as display at this point

61
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:25,370
we looked at about five billion

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,229
subscribers I still use to and 3G

63
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:33,860
networks two and three 3G devices so

64
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:42,669
each of five billion subscribers could

65
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:45,889
be attacked by a SSN hacker once hacker

66
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:48,880
appears in the ss7 in any mobile

67
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:51,590
operator they are able to attack

68
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,810
subscribers around the world any

69
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,799
subscribers of any mobile operator and

70
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:59,810
what they can do they can intercept SMS

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,680
messages they can intercept voice calls

72
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:06,289
they can define location of any mobile

73
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,520
subscribers they can perform those

74
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:13,520
attacks on subscribers and on the whole

75
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,729
networks they can steal money from

76
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:22,490
subscribers accounts and also they can

77
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:26,000
get access to the digital identity of

78
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:29,690
any subscriber like email messengers

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,480
social networks and so on

80
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:38,750
why the ss7 is not secure

81
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:45,300
when ss7 was developed it supposed to be

82
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:50,550
absolutely isolated Network and there

83
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:54,290
was no thoughts to to implement any

84
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,960
security mechanisms on the ss7 protocols

85
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:01,290
but later sigtran specification was

86
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,609
introduced that allowed to send signal

87
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:08,210
in or SSA on traffic via IP IP networks

88
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:12,720
so as a seven stop being isolated and

89
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:18,750
moreover in 19th mobile operators go to

90
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:22,140
I spread so the traffic in signal

91
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:26,430
networks rapidly increased and the

92
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:29,669
number of players in market who was

93
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:32,940
connected to the ss7 also increased and

94
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:34,860
nowadays we can see a lot of telephony

95
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,469
providers mobile operators virtual

96
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,600
mobile operators whether it's a

97
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:44,040
value-added service providers and other

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:48,510
companies who connected to ss7 so the

99
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:50,699
trust era in ss7 in signal networks is

100
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:54,219
over

101
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:57,009
mobile apparatus fortunately aware of

102
00:06:54,219 --> 00:07:00,219
this problem and they do a lot to

103
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,860
protect the networks they install SSL

104
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:04,509
firewalls install SMS home routing

105
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,879
solutions they introduce signaling

106
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:09,699
intrusion detection systems they

107
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,129
configure network equipment in

108
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:15,369
compliance with security and also they

109
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:20,529
perform independent security assessment

110
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:25,389
from the external connections so I will

111
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:29,259
use some terms some identities some

112
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:33,610
abbreviations throughout the

113
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:34,240
presentation and I need to describe all

114
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:39,520
of them

115
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,770
MSS then this is identified with a loan

116
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,938
abbreviation is just a telephony number

117
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:50,558
the second identifier is GT or global

118
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:54,789
title Global title is address of network

119
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:56,639
element in mobile networks MC

120
00:07:54,789 --> 00:08:01,080
international mobile subscriber identity

121
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:05,849
this is identity of a SIM card and nodes

122
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:12,878
STP signaling transfer point this node

123
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:15,230
this node is intended to route or switch

124
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:20,930
signaling traffic

125
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:24,140
h lr h alar is a database it stands for

126
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,910
home location register HL r contains

127
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,930
information about all subscribers

128
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:32,390
including identities like MC and MSS

129
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,240
then number of prohibited and allowed

130
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:39,620
services of particular subscriber and

131
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:43,789
some technical information next network

132
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:47,960
element is MSC and we allow this element

133
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:50,900
performs two functions first is MSC

134
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:55,370
mobile switching center this node

135
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:57,920
processes voice calls and SMS and viola

136
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,410
widget location register this is also

137
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,939
database that contains an information

138
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:09,560
about all subscribers who are active at

139
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:14,390
the moment in the coverage area of the

140
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:18,650
respective MSC and SMS see SMS center

141
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:21,689
this node is responsible for SMS

142
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:26,300
delivering and sending

143
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:30,060
and since the object is SSL I need to

144
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:33,689
explain some of protocol some of layers

145
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,579
i omit low layer protocols because they

146
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,170
are responsible for physical connections

147
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:42,510
and neighboring communications between

148
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:45,089
network elements and the lowest layer

149
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:47,610
that is used on the international

150
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,910
communications is a ccp signal

151
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,070
connection control part this layer of

152
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,920
this protocol is responsible for the

153
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:59,940
Rhoden of signal messages using global

154
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,910
titles as identities the next protocol

155
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,500
is teacup transactional capabilities

156
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:08,579
application part this protocol is

157
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:12,300
responsible to try single request and

158
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:18,860
response into one whole dialogue and

159
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:22,589
also teacup defines own application of

160
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:26,120
the upper layer upper layer usually is

161
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,890
map or mobile application part this is a

162
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,700
payload of a signaling message that

163
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:34,790
contains operation code and some other

164
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,950
parameters that are related to each

165
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:43,610
operation for example MC identity MSS

166
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,610
then identity profile data and and so on

167
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:54,350
signal Network have their own unique

168
00:10:50,359 --> 00:11:01,019
security tools the signal transfer point

169
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:05,519
this node is able to block some signal

170
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:08,850
traffic while simple rules SMS home

171
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,389
Roton this is not note but this is the

172
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,730
whole solution that intended to

173
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:18,119
primarily to prevent SMS spam and fraud

174
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:21,419
and to hide inside entities for the

175
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:24,809
axonal connections and SSL firewalls and

176
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:27,869
so a sound firewall is a mass sufficient

177
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:32,029
sophisticated security tool that is able

178
00:11:27,869 --> 00:11:38,239
to correlate data between different

179
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:47,600
layers of signal messages and find

180
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:47,600
illegitimate traffic at all ss7 messages

181
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:56,029
some details about each of these

182
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:00,000
security tools signal transfer point

183
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:03,240
this the as I previously said this is a

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,189
router of signaling traffic and usually

185
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,620
this node is used as a border point of a

186
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:12,719
mobile operator so it is reasonable to

187
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:18,480
bring in some security mechanisms into

188
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:24,089
the border device but usually STP is

189
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:29,180
able to block some traffic only using

190
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:31,430
only simple rules for example block

191
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,000
source

192
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:37,339
by the global title or block some number

193
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,580
of signal messages by operation code and

194
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:43,279
so on

195
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,410
SMS home Roton before I describe how

196
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:49,610
some s home routing works I would like

197
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:54,790
to describe SMS delivery process when

198
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:57,320
some SMS Center has SMS for subscriber

199
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:59,240
SMS Center does not know where this

200
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,690
subscriber is located because all

201
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:08,450
subscribers in mobile networks also my

202
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:12,200
balance is raking can quick it can be at

203
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:15,110
any location around the world

204
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:18,050
so SMS center first of all should

205
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,240
receive some signal in some routine

206
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:24,050
information for SMS delivery

207
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,720
it sends send routine info for SM signal

208
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:29,510
message that comes to the HLR database

209
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,890
HL are always knows where subscriber is

210
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:37,189
located at least it knows current MHz

211
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:40,010
address and it replies with two

212
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:43,439
parameters with subscribers MC and the

213
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:47,849
address of the current MSC

214
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:52,259
now SMS Center knows where to send the

215
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:53,599
SMS and it delivers this SMS to the MSC

216
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:59,519
and after that I Massey delivers this

217
00:13:53,599 --> 00:14:02,789
semester to subscriber when intruder

218
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,720
appears in cell network because they can

219
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:10,829
use this dialog send routine info for

220
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,619
4sm request and receive response to get

221
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:15,520
MC identity and address of current a

222
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:19,980
machine

223
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:23,050
SMS corrosion introduces one more

224
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:29,020
Network element that close SMS router

225
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:30,520
and now STP when STP receives send

226
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,790
routine for for a same signal message

227
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:35,860
from external connection it should

228
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:38,560
deliver this message not to the edge

229
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,250
lock but to the SMS rotor SMS rotor

230
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,369
generates some fake MCA array with a

231
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:48,490
random digits and uses its own address

232
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:52,870
instead of MSC's one SMS Center delivers

233
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,240
this message SMS message to the SMS

234
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,610
rotor and after that SMS router performs

235
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,770
the second in actual our interrogation

236
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,500
process it sends and route info for same

237
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:04,600
actual replies with real identities with

238
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:11,529
really MC and the real MC address and

239
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:14,320
after that SMS router correlates fake

240
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:18,670
generated MC with real MSS then and

241
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:24,399
delivers SMS message to the MC and after

242
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:26,500
that to the subscriber we have two SMS

243
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,779
delivery processes first of them is

244
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,829
external and second one is fully

245
00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:35,350
internal and now even through their eye

246
00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:39,750
piercing the ss7

247
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:42,279
and want to retrieve MC st-pierre sends

248
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:45,190
some Lewton for for some request to the

249
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:49,899
SMS router SMS rotor replies with fake

250
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:53,260
data so the network is protected and the

251
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:56,770
third security tool in mobile networks

252
00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:02,200
is a same firewall usually a sound

253
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:06,160
firewall is installed in loop mode when

254
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:09,490
STP receives some signal message STP

255
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,860
sends it to the SM firewall in SM

256
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:15,579
Farrell inspect this message early layer

257
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:19,589
by layer correlating data from different

258
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:24,550
layers may be having its own database

259
00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:27,610
with some information if s and we're all

260
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,930
defined the message is illegitimate it

261
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,230
just blocks it

262
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,719
otherwise SFI will send this message

263
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:38,730
back to the STP and STP delivers to the

264
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:46,889
destination not all the SSL firewalls

265
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:50,019
are based on GSM a categories just may

266
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:55,980
inspected all the potentially hostile as

267
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:55,980
seven messages and splitted them into

268
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:08,319
into three categories category one

269
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:13,720
consists can contains information can

270
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:19,510
contains the list of operations that are

271
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:24,429
available only for internal exchange not

272
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:28,620
for external category two contains lists

273
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:31,659
of messages that are available on the

274
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,658
external connections but they are

275
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:39,429
related to inbound roamers and category

276
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:43,630
three is also available on the

277
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:48,149
interconnections and these signal

278
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,149
messages of these categories are

279
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:59,110
legal only for outbound rumors so now I

280
00:17:56,049 --> 00:18:01,740
will describe several attacks and to

281
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:05,879
make this story more interesting our

282
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:11,860
intruder will use different

283
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:15,730
vulnerabilities to exploit or to do some

284
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:19,449
of attacks frost attack aims disclosure

285
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:25,029
what the MC and why intruder needs this

286
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:30,010
information MC itself is not valuable

287
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:32,110
for a intruder but when to denote these

288
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,690
informations are able to perform more

289
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,539
sophisticated attack like location

290
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:41,919
tracking SMS interception voice call

291
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:45,730
interception and etc let's look at the

292
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:49,120
cup protocol this protocol consists of

293
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:52,269
several fields first one is to cup

294
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,090
message type this is mandatory field the

295
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:59,019
second one is transaction ID this is

296
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:03,220
also mandatory field the third this is

297
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:06,549
not field but a block of fields and this

298
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:09,880
block is optional it contains one of

299
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:12,029
parameters application context name this

300
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:19,470
application context name defines the

301
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:23,019
operation that that is in the next block

302
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:27,800
component portion and this is map

303
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:31,500
operation operation of map protocol

304
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:35,720
more details about SMS delivery for each

305
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:39,090
SMS we need originating party and

306
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,570
terminating party Argentine party sends

307
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:46,010
SMS in a more mobile originating forward

308
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:49,530
sm signal and message when SMS center

309
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:52,410
receives this message it performs well

310
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:55,340
known actual interrogation procedure

311
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:59,970
receives information about termination

312
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:03,030
subscriber and sends the next signal

313
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,850
message MT forward sm about terminating

314
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,260
forward sm to deliver some s to

315
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,189
subscribe

316
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:12,570
when semester is delivered MSC

317
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,390
terminating me she sends returned

318
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:18,960
without last the same signal message

319
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,390
comes to the originated enemy c and SMS

320
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:29,790
delivery is over

321
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:33,120
so intruders use this signal exchange to

322
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,310
send a lot of spam through SSM they

323
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,090
might send a more forward to some second

324
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:43,290
message spoofing source address after

325
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:48,480
that all the signal exchange goes by the

326
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:50,040
scenario and the last component last

327
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,010
signal message comes to the originating

328
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:56,100
a me see why to the originated a messy

329
00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:04,080
because intruders proved this address as

330
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:07,260
a source to protect SMS spam hiccup can

331
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,889
shake was introduced as a standard and

332
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:14,090
now when I'm AC want to send SMS it

333
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:17,040
sends tikka begin message with

334
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:21,750
application context only that is related

335
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,879
to a genetic MSC SMS center should send

336
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,820
the cap continue that means please

337
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,310
perceive this transaction after that MSC

338
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,679
sends and more forward the same signal

339
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:35,070
message with the SMS itself within the

340
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,720
same same transaction after that SMS

341
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,330
center performs each other our

342
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,980
interrogation procedure and the performs

343
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:45,370
second

344
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,920
SMS delivery but terminating but it

345
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:51,159
could also send to cap begin message

346
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:56,620
also with application context parameter

347
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:59,170
that is related to terminate SMS MSC

348
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:02,020
since teacup continue that means please

349
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:06,720
proceed and after that SMS Center sends

350
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:09,940
empty forward the same or SMS itself

351
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:15,690
teacup config is available only between

352
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:18,790
MSC note and SMS centers no other

353
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:23,110
elements network elements could not

354
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:26,800
process this feature but if intruder

355
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:30,219
knows signaling protocols very well they

356
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,080
are able to send the cap begin signal

357
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,660
message with application context that is

358
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,639
related to the send routing info for the

359
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:42,910
same procedure operation STP when STP

360
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:46,210
processes this signal message it finds

361
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:49,420
first of all destination note this is a

362
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:51,610
char it is on the CCP layer it finds

363
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:55,030
application context name on the teacup

364
00:22:51,610 --> 00:23:00,310
layer but there is no map operation here

365
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:03,280
but map this is a trigger to send signal

366
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:06,040
message to the SMS rotor and involve SMS

367
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,280
home wrote and procedure so it is no

368
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,770
operation code no SMS home wrote and

369
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:16,660
procedure STP sends a signal message to

370
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:19,120
the HLR directly and big suprise HLR

371
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:22,660
sends continue that means please proceed

372
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,750
this operation after that intruder is

373
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:29,230
able to send send root and info for SM

374
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:32,920
request within the installed transaction

375
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:36,370
and since the transaction has been

376
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,680
installed STP does not send this signal

377
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:42,429
message to the SMS router it sends it

378
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:45,640
again to the HLR and HL are replies with

379
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,610
correct data with MC and MSC identities

380
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,460
with real identities

381
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:53,760
now intruder knows some confidential

382
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:58,110
information like UC and MSE and intruder

383
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:04,940
needs to define location of our target

384
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:09,260
subscriber now I'd like to describe

385
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:12,000
identities in signal networks I

386
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,750
mentioned MSS then and global titles

387
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,360
they have the same structure identity

388
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:23,460
this identity consists of three groups

389
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:27,570
of digits first one is a country code in

390
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:30,300
this example France second one is

391
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:34,639
Network this nation code and the third

392
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:38,669
group of digits undefined subscriber if

393
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:43,170
it is a message then or defines not if

394
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:46,980
this is a global title and the second

395
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:49,200
identity MC MC is also consists of three

396
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,300
group of digits first of them is mobile

397
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,840
country code the second one is mobile

398
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:57,540
network operator within this country and

399
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,330
the third group of digits defines a

400
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:04,409
particular subscriber and now when we

401
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:09,929
speak about comparison of global title

402
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:12,990
and MC we do not compare these

403
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:15,000
identities digits by digits because

404
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:18,450
they're from different standards and

405
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,780
they have different codes even for

406
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:25,350
countries first of all we should find

407
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:29,120
operator for each of identity and after

408
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:33,209
that compare these two operators

409
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,540
how it works for example mobile operator

410
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,730
receives

411
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,700
signal message we scored provide

412
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,380
subscriber info this is well-known

413
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:47,110
signal message that could be used by

414
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:50,840
intruders to define subscriber location

415
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:53,810
this is category 2 signal message as per

416
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:57,820
jsm a classification that means that

417
00:25:53,810 --> 00:26:04,370
operator should compare source with

418
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:07,340
subscriber identity source is defined by

419
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:10,489
global title this signal message comes

420
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:15,230
from Switzerland and this signal message

421
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:17,990
is related to a French subscriber this

422
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:21,730
is two different a great operator that's

423
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,730
why this message should be blocked

424
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:32,700
look at itu-t recommendation q77 three

425
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:39,110
it defines two teacup formats and this

426
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:45,080
table shows that all operations could be

427
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:45,080
defined as local and global codes

428
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:49,919
they have different well is 2 & 6

429
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:54,170
respectively

430
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:57,750
and all the signal messages uses this

431
00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:01,320
operation code tech it looks like this

432
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:05,480
in traffic damn Oh - means local

433
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,480
operation code then oh 1 means

434
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:18,790
length of operation self and four six

435
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:23,650
this is a hexadecimal code of provide

436
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:28,030
subscriber info operation and now if our

437
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:31,300
intruder sends signal message spoofing

438
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:33,100
or changing operation code from local to

439
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,520
a global one

440
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:39,939
even Wireshark cannot decode this

441
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:43,570
message but we see oh six means this is

442
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:45,430
a global operation code or one land and

443
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,760
for six this is provide subscriber

444
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:53,290
information STP sends this message to

445
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:56,770
the SSA own firewall as a seven firewall

446
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:59,290
start it starts inspection but it is

447
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:02,230
looking for only for local operation

448
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:05,590
codes because this is a standard and it

449
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,480
ignores all the other stuff that's why a

450
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,909
sane firewall send this message back to

451
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:14,470
the STP and STP deliver this message to

452
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:17,770
the MSE and one more interesting thing

453
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:22,120
what is surprised MSE replies with

454
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:27,930
normal response and this normal response

455
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,929
is with local operation code value

456
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:34,899
also this response contains information

457
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:39,650
about cellulite entity so intruder

458
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:44,920
receives information about subscribers

459
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:48,980
location during our testing we research

460
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:51,740
we researched equipment of four

461
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:55,630
different silicon vendors and all they

462
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:59,600
works in this manner all they responded

463
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:04,960
local value when request with what was

464
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:07,639
with a global one now how intruder knows

465
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,060
subscriber location but we see this is

466
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:14,210
not enough for him of a home and they

467
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:17,389
want to intercept voice calls of our

468
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:21,700
target subscriber and our intruder will

469
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:27,580
do this exploiting a new double map

470
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:30,590
vulnerability how classical voice

471
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:34,129
contraception attack works in mobile

472
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,949
networks into the first of all should

473
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:42,440
send insert subscriber data signal and

474
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:46,070
message this message is used to change

475
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,900
profile of a subscriber in this

476
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:53,139
particular attack intruder should spoof

477
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:56,390
billion platform of the subscriber

478
00:29:53,140 --> 00:30:00,140
changing a real address of the real

479
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:04,580
billion platform to its own address

480
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:08,029
this one STP deliver this message to the

481
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:10,340
MSC and MSC replies with some positive

482
00:30:08,029 --> 00:30:12,350
response that means the profile is

483
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,100
updated after that intruder just

484
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:17,090
finalized

485
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:19,850
finalizes transaction and they're

486
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:22,220
waiting for subscriber to call when

487
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:25,879
target subscriber calls information

488
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:30,649
comes to them a scene and MSC therefore

489
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,750
performs chargin process MSC sends

490
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:35,239
initial the P signal message to the

491
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,590
building platform but billing platform

492
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:40,789
is not real being platform is spooky and

493
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:45,580
this signal message comes to the

494
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:48,470
intruder intruder of course into the

495
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:51,949
should not perform billing of this

496
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:55,279
subscriber into the sense connect signal

497
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:59,799
message as a response to this to

498
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:02,960
previous request and the intruder uses

499
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:06,559
PBX address PBX is a private branch

500
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:10,539
exchange or small telephony switch to

501
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,340
redirect call to their own equipment

502
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:17,600
call is redirected after that intruder

503
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:21,769
is able to initiate one more new call to

504
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:24,949
the target operator intruder

505
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:27,019
uses real identity of these two

506
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,090
subscribers because because intruder

507
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:33,529
knows all this information from the

508
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:37,549
first signaling message and when signal

509
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:39,860
message comes to the operator Paul has

510
00:31:37,549 --> 00:31:42,500
been established subscribers are able to

511
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:46,490
communicate each other but voice traffic

512
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:54,120
goes through the intruders equipment

513
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:57,000
intruder is able to record this talk

514
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:02,159
mobile operators are aware of this

515
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:05,670
problem they if mobile traitor has

516
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,010
installed signal and firewall seeking

517
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:12,390
for wall works very well against this

518
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:14,820
kind of attack when STP sends hostile

519
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:17,790
and surf subscriber data signal message

520
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:22,830
to signal firewall signaling firewall

521
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:25,770
inspects source and subscriber identity

522
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:27,270
and we know that swish operate and

523
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:30,000
French operator are two different

524
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:33,290
operators so a central role should block

525
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,290
this signal message

526
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:40,280
attack is impossible one more

527
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:43,159
information one more interesting detail

528
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:46,550
about the cut protocol I have already

529
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:52,460
showed this picture with the cap

530
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:55,428
structure but company and portion could

531
00:32:52,460 --> 00:33:00,800
contain more than one component actually

532
00:32:55,429 --> 00:33:04,700
and each component should contain its

533
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:08,750
own operation code and could use even

534
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:12,410
different identities when its own

535
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:15,370
firewall faces with this kind of

536
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:19,460
messages and this is not typical message

537
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:23,270
in signal networks usually ascend

538
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:26,090
firewall inspects only first component

539
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:29,059
and it considers that the second one is

540
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,340
just a long tail of the first component

541
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:33,300
and ignore this all all these

542
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:38,129
information

543
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:41,879
and now how intruder could use this

544
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:45,330
feature of the cup protocol intruder

545
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:49,470
sense double map double-double company

546
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:52,290
signal message to the operator first

547
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:54,900
component is insert subscriber data

548
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:57,780
operation the second one is delete

549
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,910
subscriber data operation insert

550
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,430
subscriber data operation does not

551
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:05,790
contain identity of subscribe of a

552
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:08,270
subscriber this is a care is pure

553
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,270
standard

554
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:15,470
as soon fire will inspect this signal

555
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:17,569
message it looks only at the first

556
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:21,348
component it finds this component is

557
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:23,300
okay and it sends message to the STP as

558
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:27,859
the P deliver this message to the MSC

559
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:30,589
and MSC sends a return error as a reply

560
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:33,109
that's okay yes this is very strange

561
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:35,960
situation when somebody wants to insert

562
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:39,619
and delete some data simultaneously this

563
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,679
is where is - youstupid request but what

564
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:47,960
we see this error goes in teacup

565
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:49,429
continue message that means I don't

566
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,168
understand you please repeat your

567
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:55,329
request

568
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:58,430
and intruder repeats into their sense

569
00:34:55,329 --> 00:35:00,559
double company's message again first

570
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:04,190
component is insert subscriber data

571
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:06,829
without subscriber identities and the

572
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:09,410
second component is again insert

573
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:13,119
subscriber data with subscriber identity

574
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:15,890
it was and with spoofed billing platform

575
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,069
this message comes to the SSN firewall

576
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:22,549
ascend ferrule again inspects only first

577
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:23,930
component and sends this message to the

578
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:26,630
network

579
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:30,410
and this message comes to the MSC and

580
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:32,810
now MSC reply Swiss okay for the first

581
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,259
component okay for the second company

582
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:39,529
and that means profile is updated after

583
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:44,020
that intruder finalizes this transaction

584
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:49,100
and he's waiting for subscriber to call

585
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:50,509
subscriber calls MSC sends again initial

586
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,600
DP signal message that contains

587
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:56,150
information about a subscriber be

588
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,450
subscriber and some other technical

589
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:03,850
details about this call intruder is able

590
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:07,669
to redirect this voice call to the PBX

591
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:11,930
voice call goes to the intruders PBX

592
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:14,180
after that it is redirected back to the

593
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:18,609
operator subscribers are able to

594
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:25,509
communicate but traffic goes through the

595
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:30,110
intruders equipment all these findings

596
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:35,680
were contributed to GSM a just my the

597
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:40,490
cessation of all mobile operators and

598
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:44,029
all this information is in a new version

599
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:48,379
of document in the new guidelines that

600
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:52,400
is effective from May of this year so my

601
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:55,040
message to mobile operators please check

602
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,770
your security tools efficiency of your

603
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:04,009
security tools as soon as new

604
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:06,259
vulnerability is reported then please

605
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,990
use intrusion detection system along

606
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:13,340
with SSL firewalls because SSL firewalls

607
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:16,399
could not withstand all the scope of

608
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:20,450
attacks and sometimes included intrusion

609
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,250
detection system is very useful also do

610
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:25,310
not forget about new learner abilities

611
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,650
when you configure your equipment do not

612
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:31,100
forget about checkup handshakes and

613
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:34,340
about global operation codes and please

614
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:37,299
block double company and signal messages

615
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:42,099
and we see on

616
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:46,930
several exceptions of double map

617
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:50,440
messages mean problems of SSN of course

618
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:54,790
first of them is flaws of SSN

619
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:58,840
architecture operators are able to

620
00:37:54,790 --> 00:38:01,119
withstand this problem but configuration

621
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:05,490
mistakes and so software bugs are still

622
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:11,650
present and what we see when we research

623
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:15,509
4G signaling diameter protocol that is

624
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:19,599
used for 4G networks 4G networks has

625
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:26,230
absolutely the same problems what we

626
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:31,470
could see in GSM and UMTS so 6 security

627
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:33,599
is a big issue for apparatus

628
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,049
thank you for your attention please your

629
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:43,409
question

630
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:43,409
[Applause]

631
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,450
any question

632
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:59,009
hi has security researchers how can we

633
00:38:55,979 --> 00:39:02,970
access the ss7 network which hardware do

634
00:38:59,009 --> 00:39:07,500
we need and which software should we use

635
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:10,020
we have a partner who allows connection

636
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:15,260
to this assailant and this partner knows

637
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:19,770
about what we are doing in SSM and

638
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:23,789
moreover when we inspect one of any

639
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:26,819
operator in any time we have signature

640
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:30,089
or paper signed by a operator that

641
00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:32,880
operator allowed to do these actions so

642
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:35,359
this is the part partner successor to

643
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,359
this as soon

644
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:46,310
and as a question on the left hello here

645
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:51,979
just following the previous question so

646
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:55,189
this is 7 Network is not easily

647
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:57,078
accessible for for anybody is that what

648
00:39:55,189 --> 00:39:59,509
you say excuse me

649
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:01,640
it's a certain for my question is

650
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:03,229
following the previous question you what

651
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,348
you mean is that to perform these

652
00:40:03,229 --> 00:40:08,779
attacks you need an access to these 7

653
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:10,880
network that I suppose is not easy

654
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:14,479
accessible for for anyone

655
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,349
yes can reduce that that's right

656
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:22,808
fortunately it's a 7 is not available

657
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:25,910
from internet or from public IP networks

658
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:30,350
this is a big problem for intruders

659
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:32,410
but we see intruder in SS 7 exists

660
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:32,410
you

661
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,110
thank you for the presentation now my

662
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:40,690
question is regarding the firewall why

663
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:42,340
is why is the policy to accept

664
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,830
everything and to reject some few things

665
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:47,530
why isn't the opposite I mean reject

666
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:50,190
everything except only things we want to

667
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,190
go through

668
00:40:53,530 --> 00:41:02,089
uhh

669
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:06,900
what I showed right now there are some

670
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:12,558
features that some time was not covered

671
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:17,400
by six security guidelines and they're

672
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:19,859
intruders are able to perform them using

673
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,690
some software bugs configuration

674
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:25,288
mistakes mistakes in so on

675
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:28,349
