11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,119
like a lot of people in this community

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,560
don't have really

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
they don't want to question people they

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,200
don't want to get out there they don't

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,399
want to put themselves out because

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,360
they're thinking well i don't want

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,440
anybody to like slam me but i've got

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,879
questions about this community i got

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,320
questions about this industry i got

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,120
questions about life so what i do is and

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
i'm not a famous hacker i'm not like a

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,079
very great hacker it's like i do what i

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,879
do

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,440
but i've got a lot of experience it's

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,280
like a lot of it's bad

26

it's like but it teaches you lessons so

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,199
i very firmly believe in uh the the

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,280
saying a smart man learns from his

29
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,520
mistakes a wiser one learns from someone

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,400
else

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,199

32
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,439
i'm not always smart but i want to help

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,040
so be careful

35
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,560
i've had people try to trip me up and

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,600
ask me a question they didn't think i

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,159
was going to answer they were surprised

38
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,280
uh and not always the great way so

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,840
i don't i literally don't care it's like

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,920

also if no one still comes up with a

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
question that's okay

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,079
because i will randomly select people

57
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,680
from the audience to come up with a

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
question for me

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,560
so it's a win-win either way and and

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,038
people think i'm joking about that i

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,800
never joke about that it's like they

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,239
always think so but then they always

63
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,080
find out you know oops

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,879
so

65
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,840
let's have a question

66
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,239
well

68
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,280
a little bit louder so it's like

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,720
everybody can hear it it's like because

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,000
it's like this is for everybody

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,080

72
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,239
uh yeah i've screwed up a lot um

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,840
what was my most expensive one

77
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200

78
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,319

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879

88
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,280
um

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,959
trying to think it's like my most exp i

90
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
think one of my biggest screw-ups was

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,959
when i was first starting

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,760
uh and i was trying to do uh pin testing

93
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,680
network vulnerability stuff i wasn't red

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
teaming i wasn't doing anything like

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
really cool i was scanning networks i

96
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,959
was doing uh using some tools and

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,560
doing vulnerability assessments for

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
people which are totally different than

99
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
a lot of other things there's a there's

100
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
levels

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,239
and

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,440
i ran nmap on a network because you know

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,840
that's what we do we do what we do and

104
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
so you run in map

105
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,560
and

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,599
uh

107
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,959
about

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,799
an hour later

109
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
the client was coming to me like uh

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,799
what were y'all doing are y'all doing

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,720
anything like no no we're all over on

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,799
this part now we're fine he's like are

113
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,959
you sure cause it's like we

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,640
our one of our cisco routers are dead

115
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,080
and i'm like

116
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,519
well cisco

117
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
but but that wasn't a good enough

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,120
so it turns out that i totally destroyed

119
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
their uh one of their pieces of

120
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,079
equipment uh like oops my bad

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,000
but um

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,840
so i didn't get anything else after that

123
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,160
i didn't get them as a client again but

124
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
uh but yeah this was like over

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,600
15 years ago yeah it was one of my first

126
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
ones it was not good uh and

127
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
now i'm very more selective when i'm

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,280
doing scanning and when i'm going into

129
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,160
things like that

130
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,000
other questions yes there's one in the

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,360
very back

134
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,639
that's also the stall for time because

135
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,400
you know i i got to fill up the whole

136
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,240
object permanent sucks

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,639
what is the most uh underrated uh things

150
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,840
hacker thinks

151
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
like the title what was the other thing

152
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
what is the most underrated

153
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,120
act or the hacker thing the most

154
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,280
underrated hacker thing

155
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,479
i think

156
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,840
is

157
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,159
um

158
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,440
that's a good question

159
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,240
because there's quite a few it's like

160
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,520
i think the

161
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,479
under

162
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,120
rated uh hacker thing is sharing

163
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,479
one of the innate

164
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,560
things that drive us is like curiosity

165
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,080
it's learning

166
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
it's finding out why this doesn't do

167
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,840
this

168
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,479
that is what a hacker is it's like it is

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,680
basically

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
taking a three-year-old

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,039
and having the educational system

172
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
the parental units and everything not

173
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,600
destroy that curiosity

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
and then that's how they say hackers

175
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,240
because we were all born hackers when

176
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,000
you were three years old

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,080
remember well i don't but you know

178
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,759
remember hey

179
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,360
why is that that way

180
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,639
why why

181
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,680
who's that

182
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
what what does that do why

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,160
why why is it you remember it's like

184
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,160
yeah you've been around three-year-olds

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,039
it's like or me it's like you understand

186
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,080
it's that innate curiosity that we have

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
that makes us hackers

188
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,000
but the underrated thing in hacking

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,800
is sharing

190
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,280
sharing is caring

191
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,599
too many people in this industry it's

192
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,599
like want to get up and give a talk and

193
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,440
so it becomes like this narrow like

194
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
field of like all these different people

195
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,160
that speak at conferences

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,520
right

197
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
when there's so many other people in the

198
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,680
audience

199
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,800
that have information to share

200
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,240
that have

201
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,240
natural inclinations and have learned

202
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
things and gone through a path and could

203
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,960
share that to the community

204
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,840
and to the world but

205
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,960
don't because no one wants to hear it

206
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,080
or no one uh would be interested or it's

207
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,199
been talked about before

208
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,560
so we talk ourselves out of sharing

209
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,639
and this community more needs more

210
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,479
sharing from the

211
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,599
more

212
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,080
diverse voices

213
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,639
it's like we need diversity is what

214
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
makes everything in our our community

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,800
work

216
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,400
because you can't and we've learned that

217
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,080
in hacking you can't just say this is

218
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,319
the same subset of rules i'm sure that's

219
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,919
enough

220
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,319
you need more information you need more

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,360
data

222
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,160
we need more people to contribute so i

223
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
think that is the most underrated thing

224
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,759
in hacking right now is sharing

225
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,240
yes

226
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,960
okay i have um two questions sort of

227
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,479
long questions

228
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,120
the first one is that there's a famous

229
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
video of a guy going inside a bank and

230
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
stealing a cpu from the bank in a

231
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,679
physical engagement is that you

232
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
like do you do physical

233
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,519
social engineering engagements

234
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,360
about robbing a bank yes i've taken

235
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
laptops out of banks and stuff but okay

236
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,080
so it's you the second question is uh

237
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
i think i'm

238
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,760
decent behind the keyboard but

239
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,839
like doing physical stuff social

240
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,399
engineering stuff is really hard for me

241
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,040
and it scares me to to be honest what

242
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,720
what is happening in your mind when you

243
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,360
are about to enter a bank with the idea

244
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,519
that you are going to steal from them

245
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,440
like

246
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,920
what what is going on there how how are

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
you able to do that oh um well first off

248
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,640
uh right uh the question was like you

249
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,800
know what do i do right before i start a

250
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
physical uh pen test it's like uh i

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
freaked out

252
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
i mean if i have horrible imposter

253
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,560
syndrome and low self-esteem it's like

254
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,320
what if this is the time where i get

255
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
caught right off the bat the test fails

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,519
and everybody's gonna be like yeah i

257
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,040
knew he was a fraud

258
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,080
duh

259
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,240
it's like you know it's like or i didn't

260
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,399
do enough for my client i'm like now

261
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,320
they're not gonna want me to work for

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
them ever again they're gonna talk about

263
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
how bad i was at doing the job they're

264
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
not they're gonna lose what i was trying

265
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,000
to do it's like so that's the first

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
thing i do i freak out

267
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
and it's like and i have like nervous i

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,839
was like nervous right before stage it's

269
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,519
like you know because it's like

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,959
yeah i'm gonna have i know people are

271
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,160
gonna be walking out it's like because

272
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,240
this is not an exciting talk it's like

273
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,279
but

274
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,760
yes and that's cool because then i have

275
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
that moment afterwards

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,760
and i realized it's not about me

277
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
it's not about me

278
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,959
trying to break into the client or

279
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,640
trying to show them how i could pone

280
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
them

281
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
it's about the client being able to be

282
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,200
better secured because of what i'm doing

283
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,160
we have this myth that red teamers are

284
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,040
rock stars or some kind of like special

285
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,640
little subgroup of people that are like

286
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,000
so awesome and break things up the only

287
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,560
reason why the red team exists

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,880
is to make the blue team better

289
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,519
and if you're not doing that in your job

290
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,360
and thinking about being an advocate

291
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,440
instead of an adversary to the people

292
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,560
who hired you you failed

293
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
so that's what i start thinking about

294
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,880
it's like look it's not about me it's

295
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
like whatever i do they're going to

296
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,399
learn from it

297
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,040
and every engagement that i go in now i

298
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
make sure i get caught

299
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,640
i deliberately make sure i get caught

300
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
and sometimes i don't have to try

301
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,320
it's like so and that's the beauty of it

302
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
because then when you're doing a

303
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,600
physical you need to understand

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,399
something a server doesn't get upset

305
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,440
when you pop them with ms0867

306
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,560
still

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,079
right

308
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,000
it's like they don't get it's a computer

309
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,519
it doesn't matter

310
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,519
when you tell someone and you have to go

311
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,920
back to someone and tell them that they

312
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,160
shouldn't have let you in they shouldn't

313
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
have let you plug in that device to

314
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,680
their computer

315
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
that's emotions

316
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
those are people

317
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,880
they get upset

318
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,720
will they lose their job are they going

319
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
through a divorce at home

320
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
are they going through bankruptcy are

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,639
they afraid what's you don't know what

322
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,959
day they're kind of having which is also

323
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,200
the same for internet people please it's

324
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
like and so you don't know

325
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,279
what they're going through

326
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,279
but you know what you're doing is to

327
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,360
help them and that is what you have to

328
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
convey

329
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,920
it's like they shouldn't read that in a

330
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,079
report three months from now a memo

331
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,200
saying they got people let them in and

332
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,720
they have to work on the vulnerabilities

333
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,959
i always make sure i speak to every

334
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,839
single person after the engagement it's

335
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,680
like after i have escaped

336
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,519
i talk to every single person and i

337
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,519
personally tell them what happened why

338
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:26,079
it was bad and then i explained to them

339
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,240
this was not a test

340
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,120
okay

341
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,040
this was uh teaching

342
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
this was a teachable moment is what i

343
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,680
call it

344
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,760
it's like you weren't there's no loss it

345
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
was just a lesson your company wanted to

346
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,000
make sure that you understood what these

347
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,839
kind of attacks look like so they sent

348
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,959
me in

349
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,719
now you know now you'll do better

350
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,160
i have a second question if yes

351
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,600
okay so the other question is i'm

352
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,839
relatively young and new to the industry

353
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
and the hacking stuff and i've seen that

354
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,800
there's a lot a lot of people that maybe

355
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,360
had internet access from the early days

356
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,320
and they

357
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,880
think of themselves like the ogs of

358
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,279
hacking and i've seen a lot of people in

359
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,160
on the internet and forums like

360
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
shaming the new people because uh before

361
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,000
the times were harder and better and

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,920
honestly i think that's [ __ ] and a

363
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,120
lot of

364
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
all people in the industry and the in

365
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,839
the scene has these attitudes so what is

366
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,880
your take on on that because even us

367
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
beginners we are trying like

368
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,200
things are different now but we are

369
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,040
doing this with passion right yeah my uh

370
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,360
my take on that is you know he's talking

371
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,639
about gatekeepers he's talking about

372
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,880
like what do we do about the gatekeepers

373
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,519
it's like we're effing hackers screw the

374
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,839
gate jump the

375
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,160
fence go under it circumvent it we don't

376
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,720
have to be stopped what you get is a

377
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,560
whole bunch of

378
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,160
awkward people who don't know how to

379
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,199
deal with things but they've got this

380
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,800
one little skill

381
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
and they think they're the i'm the best

382
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,519
at this so it's up to me to be the

383
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,839
horrible person other people were to me

384
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,680
when i was starting up because that's

385
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,839
the way it is

386
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,240
and like i'm like no

387
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,199
there's i am literally

388
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,360
not the only one in this

389
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,560
conference

390
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,600
that can give a couple of talks

391
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,680
and that what i mean by that i mean all

392
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
of you

393
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,240
there is no

394
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,720
people going and saying oh how deep i

395
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,279
don't know how to program

396
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,519
i can't program myself out of a plastic

397
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,279
bag

398
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,279
it's like i try to keep my teach my

399
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,440
youngest child how to code with python

400
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,199
with the no starts book you know hacking

401
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,760
with minecraft and python

402
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,279
yeah

403
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,240
i got

404
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
chapter two almost

405
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
and i was like yeah you're on your own

406
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,079
kid you work with that it's like i'm

407
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,839
sure that'll work

408
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,959
it's like so i mean it's not my skill

409
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,199
that doesn't make me stupid

410
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,880
that means i'm just ignorant of those

411
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,680
things and ignorance is not a bad word

412
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,199
willful ignorance is bad

413
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,639
but being ignorant of something and

414
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,399
wanting to learn something is not a bad

415
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,199
thing

416
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
it's like we constantly have so many

417
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,880
people telling us what we can't do

418
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,800
but the loudest voice that we hear in

419
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,920
our heads is ourselves

420
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,519
agreeing with them trying to find out

421
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,000
all the reasons why we can't talk

422
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,759
why we shouldn't share

423
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,240
why we can't do something

424
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,120
screw that voice too

425
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,000
it's like so don't let people say oh and

426
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,600
most of them are like afraid it's like

427
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,279
you start challenging those it's just

428
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,360
like any bully that you see in school

429
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,920
it's like it's just cowardness

430
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,560
they're afraid of losing their status

431
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,440
they're afraid of losing their

432
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
credentials they're afraid of losing

433
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,959
they're standing where we're like i'm

434
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,959
the big guy i'm afraid that someone else

435
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,880
is going to come in and be better than

436
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,560
me

437
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,639
too bad

438
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,079
and what i was saying before about

439
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,920
diversity it's like

440
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,240
it's horrible

441
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,199
it's like because they want to limit

442
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,800
people who they don't think belong

443
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,240
who they don't think should be somewhere

444
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,639
and i'm sorry but that never works out

445
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,120
for anybody

446
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,160
it's like everybody is welcome here

447
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,720
and i gave a rant uh a long time ago at

448
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,480
uh i think it was like

449
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,160
two decades ago or so it was it was 2019

450
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,000
at la hack where i talked more about

451
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,959
that

452
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,680
so don't let them say you can't be

453
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,800
somewhere

454
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,320
trust me i never let that stop me when

455
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,800
i'm going into a bank but it's like but

456
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,839
do that it's like understand you can do

457
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,000
what you want to do but don't let

458
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,759
reality get in the way of you trying to

459
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,759
accomplish it

460
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,759
okay i'm a high school dropout who used

461
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,360
to live behind a dumpster

462
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
it's like and i'm on stage and for some

463
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
reason people want to hear what i'm

464
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,839
saying that's not realistically

465
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,959
something that's supposed to happen

466
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,760
i just don't care

467
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,839
so there you go thank you

468

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,959
to make the guys with the mics walk

471
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,319
around you have to raise your hand

472

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,320
uh i have been a mess

502
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960

503
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,799

504
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,200

505
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360

in uh in the lin into january of this

507
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,360
year

508
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,200
giving a talk and i've been like really

509
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,720
depressed with you know my whole work

510
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,799
situation and what's been going on and

511
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,720
some other situations that are gone and

512
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,679
i was and i love berlin it's like it's a

513
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
beautiful city it's like it's full of

514
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,880
history it's got like a lot of great

515
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,679
architecture and the urban art

516
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,840
that's what i love i love the graffiti i

517
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,360
love going to cities and seeing it's

518
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,440
like france i mean paris knows about

519
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
that y'all have some amazing uh street

520
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,679
art here and

521
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,520
and i could have done some more walking

522
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
there were some places i wanted to go i

523
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,360
spent two days

524
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
just in my room i could barely get out

525
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,200
of out of bed

526
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
it's like i just wasn't motive i just

527
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,799
couldn't do it

528
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,880
it's like and so

529
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,720
depression sucks but it's like we we

530
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,559
have problems in our i mean a lot of

531
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,240
people are neurodivergent in this

532
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
industry and in this community it's like

533
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,880
it makes us better it's like it makes us

534
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,840
different

535
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,360
it's like that's all it just makes us

536
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,039
different and so

537
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,039
i've been more open about mine so other

538
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,160
people will realize it's not a bad thing

539
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,520
but

540
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,159
when it hits it's like you just

541
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,000
try to remind yourself i have

542
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,679
notifications

543
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,080
and i have notes that come up

544
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
that tell me it's like this needs to get

545
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,880
done

546
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,799
it's like when i have that certain time

547
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,200
frame it's like it helps my executive

548
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,679
dysfunction disorder say

549
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
you know oh this has to be done now

550
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,840
so

551
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,360
when you're you're losing that

552
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,039
motivation

553
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,200
it's like it's hard to convince yourself

554
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,799
to keep going

555
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,400
and that's why you need that external

556
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,559
source you need something else to like

557
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,159
show you like okay no you need to do

558
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,120
this and i'm a hypocrite if i say that

559
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,880
it it always works

560
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,320
because it doesn't

561
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
it's like but that's the best thing but

562
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,760
that's the best thing i can offer it's

563
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,000
like so when you lose that motivation

564
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,159
when you're working on a project and the

565
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,159
the exploit keeps failing

566
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,039
it's like it doesn't matter

567
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,880
it's like you're trying it and you're

568
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
trying to do something

569
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
and the effort is what counts

570
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,039
not the result

571
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,200
because there's a lot of people who say

572
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,280
oh i'm going to do this and i'm going to

573
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
do that and don't

574
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,960
so even if you failed you still are more

575
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,600
successful than half the people that

576
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,640
want to do it but don't

577
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,720
okay thank you

578
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,159
yes

579
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,600
oh there's someone right down here

580
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,000
i guess one sec uh they're wondering

581
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
about red team engagements

582
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
a code of ethics oh that's a very good

583
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,480
point because there are some people that

584
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
have ethic problems in this community

585
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
that are social engineers

586
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,880
but i would say yes i do have a code of

587
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,039
ethics it's like and one of the key

588
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,720
things uh for any and this goes to any

589
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
uh engagement it's like in life it's

590
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,000
like it's very simple it's like

591
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
i do not harm people

592
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
i tried to do no harm and what that

593
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,080
means is i do not send phishing emails

594
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,880
out

595
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
in the middle of an apocalypse telling

596
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
people they're going to get a bonus

597
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
it's like as a company email

598
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,200
i don't send an email out to my

599
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
employees to tell them that there's a

600
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,840
free vaccine in february of 2021 and

601
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,439
they need to register and sign up

602
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,799
that

603
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,280
is and i don't cuss very often but

604
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,919
please understand that is [ __ ]

605
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,640
disgusting

606
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,559
because you know what you may not have

607
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,520
had

608
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,360
a lot of insider threats in your

609
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,600
institution or your company

610
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,158
but after that email i guarantee you do

611
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,600
when you want to give an employee

612
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,320
a

613
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
teachable moment

614
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
you can do a demo

615
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,320
and show them how bad those phishing

616
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,640
emails can get

617
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,200
never sending to the employees

618
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,159
but using it in a company-wide talk i've

619
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,960
done a talk on phishing emails and what

620
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,840
i do

621
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,960
and how i use those and every example i

622
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,640
use is horrible

623
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,960
i use the murder of two young girls

624
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,000
as a fishing pretext

625
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
i never sent it i showed them and you're

626
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
thinking like that is horrible mother

627
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
i'm trying to rob you what part of

628
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,320
criminal do you not understand

629
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,600
because that's what criminals do

630
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,520
if you don't think that there are a

631
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,200
dozen or more

632
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,400
red crescent sites set up right now to

633
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,559
aid the earthquake in afghanistan you'd

634
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,600
be sorely mistaken

635
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,919
it's like after every single major

636
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,240
disaster before the help gets there

637
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,080
there's someone setting up a website to

638
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,799
get money off of it

639
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,360
you do not stoop down to the criminal's

640
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,919
level to teach that lesson to the

641
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,760
employee

642
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,799
you do no harm

643
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,240
so you have to make choices

644
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,640
how bad am i going to lie

645
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,960
how way am i going to circumvent

646
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,120
what am i going to take

647
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,799
and it's like and i've literally i've

648
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,520
felt horrible sometimes on these

649
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,000
engagements i told

650
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
the mother teresa of jamaica who was the

651
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,799
head of a charity organization in

652
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,840
jamaica i told her i was putting them on

653
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,919
television i was a tv producer and i

654
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,600
wanted to show them the uh one of the

655
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,679
episodes we'd already filmed on my usb

656
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:38,720
stick

657
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,400
i didn't directly show it to her because

658
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,279
that way i'm not too evil uh but i

659
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,720
showed it to uh the uh the main guy

660
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,600
of the organization that is effing

661
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,039
horrible

662
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,120
remember i told you that i always go

663
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,640
back after two minutes and go and talk

664
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,240
to each person

665
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,600
the only time that did not occur was on

666
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,039
that engagement

667
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,679
i literally was like legit like i called

668
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,679
the guy up and i was like um

669
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,640
um

670
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
yeah you can't make me go back in

671
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
uh i'm not going in i'm not doing it

672
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,960
it's like i'm sorry it's like i've never

673
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
said i was professional i can't go back

674
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,799
and tell those people what i did so you

675
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,039
need to let them know uh thank you

676
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,679
bye-bye uh so yeah it was it was a

677
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,039
little awkward it's like and i still

678
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,200
feel bad about that

679
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,000
but it helped the company learn

680
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,640
i did not harm them in doing this

681
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,279
so that's the main thing it's like do no

682
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,600
harm

683
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,520
uh oh yes one more and then and then

684
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
i'll start looking at that way but yes

685
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,159
um hi um my first question is uh i think

686
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,240
very important but

687
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,679
um it's how are you you talk about

688
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,400
two

689
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,279
hard years because of covered and

690
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,080
all other stuff my first question is how

691
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,440
are you and the second is

692
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,120
link to your

693
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
professional activity

694
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,080
uh what is the fail that caused you the

695
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,679
biggest shame

696
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,720
uh

697
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,440
fortunately uh i mean

698
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,400
okay the first question was how am i

699
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
oh i'm doing better now

700
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,640
i was a train wreck uh it's like

701
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,360
whatever i share on on social media is

702
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,960
like one-tenth of what is actually going

703
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
on uh but it's like i try to make

704
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,559
statements i try to be honest with

705
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,679
myself

706
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,600
and people don't realize i don't use

707
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
twitter as social media that's my mother

708
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,480
can live journal that is what i use to

709
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,520
remind myself because i am constantly my

710
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,600
whole room thing everybody sees my lab

711
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,279
they see how chaotic it is and it's cool

712
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,559
all these things

713
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,880
those are memories because i have a

714
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,640
soundtrack in the back of my head

715
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,360
constantly telling me how worthless i am

716
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,760
and how little i've done and that i

717
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,080
can't do anything so i use those things

718
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,960
as visual reminders and cues to like go

719
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,440
no i've done that that is cool it's like

720
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,039
so it's like i use that as a visual

721
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,360
reminder so

722
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,440
uh i'm doing better though now so i am

723
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,880
doing better it's like it's been rough

724
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,080
it's like i'm starting to find some

725
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,919
positivity and it's like and that's the

726
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,360
reason why i'm starting to tweet more

727
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,399
it's like you're seeing more of the

728
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,159
pictures of the hacker adventures i had

729
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,320
a backlog of two months of hacker

730
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,840
adventure pictures because quite

731
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,080
honestly i was just

732
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,679
i was not feeling it it's like that's a

733
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,240
lie because i was being happy on the

734
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,039
picture for social media for the a-roll

735
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,720
when actuality i was doing it because

736
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,080
well i need to do it people want to see

737
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,919
it it's like and i wasn't doing it for

738
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,240
me so i didn't feel really at the moment

739
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,399
to feel like tweeting it out

740
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,919
but i'm now getting back to a better

741
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,120
place where i'm like okay i want to

742
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,559
tweet i want to share this i want people

743
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,440
to see

744
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,960
the places i go could i go to some weird

745
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,520
places and do some weird things so

746
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,760
that's what i'm doing now and the second

747
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,480
question was

748
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,000
oh how do i do the uh how do i stay

749
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,799
productive how do i work functionally in

750
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,840
the work

751
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,000
uh no my second question is about uh

752
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,640
your biggest fail uh what is the biggest

753
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,279
fail that caused you

754
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,679
the shame sentiment oh the biggest fail

755
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,520
that calls me the biggest shame

756
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,480
oh yes oh my gosh yes i i know i got

757
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,760
that one down

758
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,640
um

759
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,480
some people in here might have heard

760
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,360
about

761
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,000
darknet diaries episode six

762
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,360
right

763
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,240
you do realize that is my biggest

764
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,799
biggest fail

765
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,480
do you know how bad you have to suck

766
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,720
to like not only just go out of scope a

767
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,399
little bit

768
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,960
but effing go into the wrong bank don't

769
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,640
even pay attention to where you're at

770
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,799
just because you got to pee and you rob

771
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,919
people that weren't asking for it

772
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,320
that was a mistake

773
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,120
that was wrong

774
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,000
that was and the the best part about it

775
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
is that everybody thinks it's so cool so

776
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,320
everybody brings it up

777
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,600
yeah i heard your dozer yeah uh-huh it

778
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,799
was a good one

779
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,720
yeah i screwed up on that one didn't i

780
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,039
just because i got away with it

781
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,559
makes it cool

782
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,080
just because it looks like you know i

783
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,039
got to rob a bank it's like that sounds

784
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,320
cool

785
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,159
but when you look at the underlying

786
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,360
stuff

787
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,960
and you start to think about it which it

788
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,039
took me a while to start actually

789
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,559
thinking about it

790
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,520
i realized how badly i failed

791
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,760
and it's like and how badly i need to do

792
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,880
better

793
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,399
so now i always make sure i go to the

794
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,960
restroom before i start trying to rob a

795
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
place and i also make sure i pay

796
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,159
attention to make sure it's the right

797
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,799
place i i know of another person who uh

798
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,480
did tone loc yes i'm old uh to a whole

799
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,399
region in another country

800
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,840
that was bad

801
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,000
that was an f up that wasn't like haha i

802
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,440
got the war drive you know half of

803
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,880
brazil

804
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,200
that was a screw-up those things sound

805
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,279
cool except when you realize the person

806
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,520
who did it shouldn't have done it didn't

807
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,240
want to do it and feel bad about it

808
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
i actually met up with the

809
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,320
the guy who was the head of security for

810
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,120
the accidental bank uh in dubai and we

811
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,840
just we had a laugh it's like because

812
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,320
his responses were amazing

813
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,159
they had a great blue team that like

814
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,840
responded once they realized what was

815
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,559
going on and they didn't arrest me it's

816
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,840
like i mean it took me about three or

817
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,279
four hours to

818
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,200
get to that point but they were willing

819
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,399
to listen they were listening to take

820
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,919
the data and they're willing to make

821
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,279
that decision not just because their

822
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,600
feelings were hurt or they felt bad that

823
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,559
i'd gone in there and did these things

824
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,520
so

825
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,840
uh that is uh probably uh my biggest

826
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,080
fail

827
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,520
another question oh there's a question

828
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,840
right there sorry

829
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,039
now raise your hand again it's a race

830
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,399
okay

831
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,879
she went

832
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,320

contracted us to do the job

849
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,120
literally

850
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,279
uh he goes to his desk to find me

851
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,039
sitting in it

852
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,039

853
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,360
badge that i stole off their desk after

854
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,080
i found a way to get into the suite that

855
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,840
i was told had never been breached

856
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,960
before

857
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,600
no one usually gets out of the lobby and

858
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,200
that's why i always say never go through

859
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
the lobby i love freight elevators it's

860
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
like and so and so i show them that and

861
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,519
i freaked them out but you know what

862
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,720
they did

863
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,360
they didn't make excuses

864
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,200
they didn't like feel bad they didn't

865
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,080
argue they learned

866
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,399
they learned from those mistakes

867
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,799
the ceo of the company during his

868
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,640
company-wide meeting

869
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,640
where he pays for everybody to come to

870
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,919
this meeting

871
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,519
literally said

872
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,039
we need to do better about security

873
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,559
awareness

874
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,720

875
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,240
is important for that year so 2019 they

876
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,080

877
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,720

879

two that doesn't matter

929
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,760
that's just human nature but at every

930
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,800
single department

931
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,399

935
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,879

of this can you show me the email

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,119
it was amazing

939
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,480
that was the most successful

940
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,960
job i've ever done in my life

941
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,599
that was the most amazing thing

942
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,399
was i kept getting caught

943
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,239
they were paying attention they learned

944
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,560
from what happened in the before and

945
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
they started getting better and it

946
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,599
doesn't matter that i was successful in

947
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,520
other sections you know why

948
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,480
because

949
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,320
screw this hole we're never getting

950
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,000
breached thing

951
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
okay i don't know what that is

952
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,560
it's not we're never getting breached

953
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,040
what keeps a company solvent is how

954
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,599
quickly can you detect the breach

955
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,400
how quickly do you react to it

956
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,640
that is the deciding factor of a company

957
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,160
nowadays

958
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,960
it's not preventing it you know i think

959
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,520
we've learned you can't build walls make

960
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,440
the apt pay for it and think you're

961
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,040
going to be secure

962
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,440
that just doesn't work

963
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,359
how quickly can you detect when

964
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,760
something happens in response so with

965
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,520
all those other people that caught me

966
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,160
even though i was successful

967
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,359
they still were able to manage the

968
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,400
breach

969
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,560
they learned in five minutes that

970
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,079
something had been plugged in something

971
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,400
bad was on the network

972
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,640
then five months later

973
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,160
or a year later

974
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,560
when they read it on on the website it's

975
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,280
like a new site and their ceos are

976
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,119
telling them that it's like you know apt

977
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,119
yes

978
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,200

979
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,520

it's like

1002
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,200
learn and share how you failed

1003
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,599

1004
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,760

1009
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,160
it's like so

1010
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,720
just don't try to listen to the stuff

1011
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,640
that you're saying and the roadblocks

1012
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,359
you put up just keep learning and

1013
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,480
understand

1014
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,560
you are not alone

1015
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,240
everybody wants to be that special

1016
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,000
snowflake in the special snowflake

1017
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,800
blizzard people i'm sorry

1018
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,839
okay

1019
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,720
that's not that's not going to work

1020
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,440
no matter how many black hoodies you see

1021
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,119
you know it's like and how many people

1022
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,200
you see with all the cool stickers

1023
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,440
we're all the same

1024
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,160
we're all trying to do better we're all

1025
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,599
trying to learn

1026
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,359
and we're all needing to share

1027
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,960
information to others to help them out

1028
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,000
yes

1029
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,160
oh wait no i'm sorry it was this person

1030
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,480
next and then that person over there but

1031
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,640
yes just one second

1032
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,799
yes

1033
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,520
okay i have a question i would just want

1034
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,000
to go back what you said about don't

1035
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,839
limit yourself

1036
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,680
but sometimes

1037
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,800
you face of giant bias

1038
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,200
or race bias so

1039
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,079
you can have some voice in your head or

1040
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,200
limit yourself but it depends of the

1041
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,240
environment that's where you work

1042
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,320
i have a question how

1043
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,160
you you did for your own bias because i

1044
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,640
know that buyers can

1045
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,079
often make me take the bad decision in

1046
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,280
work how to deal with that for your own

1047
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,320
bias

1048
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,040
yeah um bias sucks uh it doesn't suck uh

1049
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,480
as much for me because i'm a white guy

1050
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,480
it's like let's be honest

1051
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,440
it's like expectations for me are lower

1052
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,440
it's like in this thing

1053
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,520
being a woman

1054
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,359
being female presenting in in this

1055
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,359
environment sucks

1056
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,760
majorly

1057
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,040
each person in here each woman in here

1058
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,560
has had to do 10 times more

1059
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,800
than their counterpart

1060
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,760
to make it here

1061
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,960
because they had to face that bias every

1062
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,200
day

1063
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,760
it's like people of color

1064
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,320
especially in america have to it's not

1065
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
something that they can take the black

1066
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,640
hoodie off and not be seen as a hacker

1067
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,480
that is something they are born with and

1068
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,880
have to deal with every single day that

1069
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,520
they shouldn't

1070
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,880
our community like what i was talking

1071
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,400
about was diversity

1072
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,240
that's exactly what's going to save this

1073
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,320
industry and i think a lot of other

1074
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,640
things we need to understand

1075
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,599
that we are just meat robots

1076
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,320
i am nothing but a meat robot

1077
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,560
i am a consciousness

1078
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
that is going around and i use these

1079
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,680
things and i use my external uh meat

1080
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,079
robotic organic robotic body to take me

1081
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,400
to the places and and say what i want to

1082
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,280
do

1083
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,440
that's my consciousness

1084
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,960
my meat robot has nothing to do

1085
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,920
with what knowledge i share

1086
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,319
it doesn't have anything to do

1087
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,200
with what i'm trying to do

1088
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,440
it's like i don't care

1089
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,400
what

1090
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,359
your paint job is on your meat robot

1091
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,760
i don't care if you decide later to

1092
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,319
change the equipment on your meat robot

1093
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,240
i don't care who you decide to couple

1094
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,119
with it's like with your meat robot

1095
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,599
that doesn't matter

1096
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,760
what do you know and what can you share

1097
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,640
so

1098
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
you are going and i can't tell you i'm

1099
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,680

1100
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,760
sorry can't lie i can't say oh it's

1101
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,599
going to get better

1102
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,160
it's like not just yet

1103
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,240
until we get more

1104
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,440
people

1105
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,200
who are already facing that burden

1106
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,280
speak out more

1107
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,079
and start motivating there are a lot of

1108
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,520
great people on twitter there's a lot of

1109
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,480
great people in this society and in our

1110
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,599
community

1111
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,839
that are being louder

1112
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,240
they're not knowing their place

1113
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,400
they're speaking up

1114
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,400
and a lot of people hate it

1115
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,960
and i'm here for it with popcorn

1116
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,359
it's like one of the best advice that i

1117
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,200
give people when they're trying to do

1118

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,160
you need to channel your inner mediocre

1127
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,280
white dude

1128
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,480

that's what you need to do because i'm a

1130
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
mediocre white dude

1131
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,720
anytime i go to a job interview and

1132

1136
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,079

1137
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,520

they're like well do you know uh this

thing it's like give me a second

1140
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,599
it's like oh but it says that you're not

1141
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,359
familiar with this protocol you know

1142
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,240
what

1143
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,880
your company is and you hire me i get to

1144
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,560
learn it the way that you do it

1145
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,720
so many people call her so many women

1146
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,000
look at a job resume a a job posting and

1147
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,400
they go oh i don't know that very well

1148
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,640
or i don't know that group

1149
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,839
girl you don't even have to wait for the

1150
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,520
gatekeeper you're doing it for yourself

1151
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,200
it's like what's the harm in asking

1152
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,839
what's the harm in trying

1153
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:42,240
because there's a lot of harm about not

1154
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,680
doing nothing

1155
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,800
and we also need in this community

1156
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,200
a lot of mediocre white dudes to stand

1157
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,560
up and lend and amplify their voices

1158
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,240
to those people

1159
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,960
we need a lot more of those people who

1160
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,040
are comfortable

1161
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,119
speaking up

1162
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,599
it's like

1163
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,079
i don't want to go it gets i'm very it's

1164
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,160
a very touchy subject with me

1165
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,680
it's like because you know we don't need

1166
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,640
allies that just talk

1167
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,160
and share something like and try to be

1168
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,400
like you know positive on the internet

1169
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,640
mother we need them now

1170
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,599
standing up when it's unpopular

1171
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,680
standing up when it's got they got

1172
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,440
something to risk because you know what

1173
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,880
every single person they're trying to

1174
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,040
help always has had to risk that

1175
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,839
and that is what we need to start doing

1176
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:35,680
it's like if you don't think you if you

1177
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,440
want to know what living on the edge is

1178
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,800
like

1179
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,240
living with risk being dangerous

1180
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,400
try to think of a person of color

1181
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,040
walking down a street in houston texas

1182
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
it takes more courage than i've

1183
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,920
got i don't have to fear

1184
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,240
when i get pulled over by the police

1185
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,599
usually sometimes i get scared because

1186
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,760
i'm pretty sketchy but i don't have to

1187
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,839
do that

1188
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,000
and because it's outside of my realm of

1189
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,240
possibility

1190
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,079
i forget

1191
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,079
how hard it is

1192
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,240
because everything's great for me

1193
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,280
i can go to a party

1194
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,920
at a hacker conference

1195
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,680
and i don't have to worry about my

1196
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,400
drinks getting roofied

1197
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,200
i don't have to uh worry if someone's

1198
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,879
following me to my hotel room

1199
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,119
i don't have to make sure that i have

1200
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,079
contingencies

1201
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,119
and people that will check up on me

1202
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,200
through the night or the night after or

1203
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,839
the morning after to make sure i'm still

1204
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,599
alive

1205
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,800
i don't deal with that

1206
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,640
that's out of my realm of possibility

1207
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,359
and it is an everyday occurrence

1208
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,319
to those people it applies to

1209
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,079
and we don't like thinking about those

1210
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,640
things because those things are not cool

1211
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,400
those things are not happy go lucky

1212
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,359
stuff

1213
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,520
and that is the reason why they're still

1214
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,560
having to deal with that in silence and

1215
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,240
we're trying to turn a blind eye to it

1216
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,560
wow that really brought the room down

1217
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,920
yes

1218
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,280
yes

1219
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,119
is it working no

1220
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,040
yes okay

1221
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,720
it's not as a big question as the

1222
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,240
previous one so sorry for that

1223
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,920
how did you deal with your family uh

1224
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,800
all this we all think about all the sta

1225
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,160
the time spent on computers trying to

1226
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,599
learn to to read books or did you deal

1227
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,520
with your family time

1228
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,800
how do you how did you manage that

1229
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,160
not very well

1230
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,440
um

1231
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,280
i tell people people are like say i'm so

1232
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,720
good at something i'm saying yeah cause

1233
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,400
i'm a horrible husband and a lousy

1234
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,520
father it's like it helps uh it's like

1235
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,960
the the key thing is

1236
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,880
uh and my thing is different it's like

1237
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,240
because i come from a lot of childhood

1238
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,079
trauma and i've come in through a lot i

1239
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,000
literally thought for like the first

1240
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,680
five ten years that i tried i was

1241
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,839
traveling and doing i thought the more

1242
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,960
time i was away from my family

1243
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
the better would be because i was such a

1244
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,040
horrible father and i was such a

1245
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,440
horrible influence that they didn't need

1246
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,400
me

1247
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,839
to be there

1248
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,040
uh i started in 2021 i started taking

1249
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,680
medication for my adhd i started

1250
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,119
realizing it's like you know and

1251
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:32,400
embracing the part that i'm on the

1252
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,240
spectrum and i don't need the mass so

1253
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,040
much

1254
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,200
and i started realizing i could be good

1255
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,640
enough

1256
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,040
and so i've started carving out family

1257
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,400
time

1258
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,400
it's like so that's a good thing it's

1259
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,880
like my also my uh relationship and my

1260
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,400
uh

1261
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,640
uh personal stuff is way more diverse

1262
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,200
and and different than most

1263
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,760
cookie-cutter normal families are

1264
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,440
so it's like and i'm okay with that too

1265
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,119
and everybody's okay with that but

1266
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,119
that's just the way it is but i'm still

1267
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,760
trying to be better as a human

1268
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,440
which means being better at someone

1269
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,960
that's interacting with those people

1270
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,440
because children are not your property

1271
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,359
children are not what you own

1272
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,079
they're ones that you've been bestowed

1273
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,880
responsibility for for the first 18

1274
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,079
years 20 years of their life

1275
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,920
so they can make changes that you don't

1276
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,559
like they can do things that they don't

1277
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,800
like my youngest child has decided to

1278
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,720
change their name

1279
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,800
and i was like i'm all here for it would

1280
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,160
you like me to start calling you that or

1281
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,839
would you like to just wait said no no

1282
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,440
you can keep calling me this but i want

1283
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,359
to get it legally changed that's exactly

1284
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,200
what you should do

1285
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,720
because you know why

1286
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,800
i didn't know you

1287
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,680
when you were born

1288
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,319
why do you get to be stuck with the name

1289
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,400
that i gave you without even knowing you

1290
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,119
sight unseen

1291
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,200
it's like so you choose the name that

1292
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,640
represents you

1293
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,640
because you should know you and that

1294
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,800
should be your name

1295
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,040
and that is exactly the way it is

1296
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
it is not my job to keep them in this

1297
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,280
little mold that i have of what it was

1298
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,680
and i've gone and i've struggled with it

1299
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,880
i have struggles like some of the things

1300
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,640
like oh oh they're thinking about doing

1301
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,400
that or

1302
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,720
it's not about me

1303
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,200
i should be there for them

1304
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,040
i should be helping them

1305
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,599
as they go along and down this path i

1306
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,200
shouldn't be another roadblock they have

1307
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,520
to overcome

1308
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,319
all right next question

1309
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:39,359
i don't know how much longer i don't

1310
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,200
even have a watch i don't know i'm just

1311
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,480
running till they kick me off

1312
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,839

1314
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,000
not know what time it was so i apologize

1315
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,520

is not being honest

1328
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,119
with myself

1329
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,599
i've been i've been um when i was very

1330
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,079
young it's like uh

1331
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,920
i'm old okay

1332
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,240
so when i was young and people were on

1333
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,960
the spectrum they were just rambunctious

1334
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,319
they were wild they were like not

1335
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,040
controllable they were bad things

1336
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,160
and i had a very abusive uh childhood

1337
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,720
with a a mother that was like you know

1338
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,400
the worst um and

1339
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,079
i learned a mask back then i learned how

1340
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,040
to read body language i learned how to

1341
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,000
uh show and try to be what people were

1342
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,079
expecting of me

1343
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,000
so i would not you know

1344
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,680
so i could still live

1345
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,800
it's like and suffered less damage

1346
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,079
it's like so i did that and i then got

1347
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:16,960
so

1348
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,200
caught up in that

1349
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,720
that i just started masking all the time

1350
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,280
and i trying to be what i thought

1351
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,640
everybody wanted jason to be

1352
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,680
so

1353
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,559
in uh and i mean and trust me you ain't

1354
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,440
seeing jason right now

1355
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,440
that's a train wreck you're seeing jason

1356
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,040
e street whenever you see me with all

1357
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,000
this jewelry on this is my costume that

1358
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,680
gives me enough confidence to get on

1359
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,640
this stage and say these things

1360
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,200
i would not be here i literally am

1361
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,760
masking right now just so i can perform

1362
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,000
it's like and when and trust me i think

1363
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,240
this is a performance you know but it's

1364
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,599
like but also hopefully something

1365
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,680
educational i like to be entertaining as

1366
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,800
you learn

1367
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,440
but my biggest regret is not doing it

1368
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,960
sir it wasn't until 2021 that i allowed

1369
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,520
myself to stop masking

1370
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,920
i allowed myself to be normal and the

1371
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,920
way that i should be

1372
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,920
when i'm not on stage when i'm not at a

1373
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,040
conference

1374
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,200
and it freaks people out it freaks me

1375
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,359
out sometimes

1376
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,160
it's like i have certain tics that i do

1377
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,079
it's like i'll repeat words or they'll

1378
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,160
be like a big pause long awkward science

1379
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,920
because i'm trying to process

1380
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,160
it's like uh i'm still halfway in

1381
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,599
character uh halfway in character but

1382
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,280
it's like i do this hand thing that's

1383
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,599
very annoying sometimes and i talk out

1384
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,319
loud more than i used to i verbalize

1385
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,119
more

1386
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:45,599
it's like so uh it is definitely

1387
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,200
different but that is my biggest regret

1388
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,480
because i did not allow myself to be me

1389
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,040
because i had to please the expectations

1390
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,559
of other people

1391
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,319
and uh that's the same thing that with

1392
00:51:56,319 --> 00:51:58,160
my work life too that's what makes me so

1393
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,359
good at social engineering i've never

1394
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,559
trained professionally for social

1395
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,680
engineering

1396
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,079
it's like i was that's all based off of

1397
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,000
some really great childhood trauma that

1398
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,480
gave me some great lessons

1399
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,880
so my biggest regret was not being me

1400
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,880
sooner

1401
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:23,519
[Applause]
