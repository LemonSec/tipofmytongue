00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,280
[Applause]

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,600
hello everybody

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
thank you for your time i appreciate it

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,800
so

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,679
yeah

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,440
i'm ellie uh

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,639
first of all i want to say thanks

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,080
for giving us these nice t-shirts

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,760
because uh

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,400
yeah indeed i lost my luggage during my

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,760
travel

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
so yeah that's a fun fact

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,119
and i jumped here from another

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,880
conference so

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
jet lag but yeah

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,719
i'm really happy to be here and

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,440
yeah welcome you guys

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,719
yeah today i'm gonna talking about

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,800
cyber security reduction by taking

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,920
advantage of uh machine learning based

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,280
algorithms

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,039
uh especially

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,120
a case study an intrusion detection

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,039
system which i did before during a

25
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,840
technical have academic work

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,559
so if you're already

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,680
we can starting the session

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,320
a little about me uh yeah i'm a security

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,520
enthusiast and working around 10 years

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
and right now i'm a security engineer at

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,759
picnic technologies

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,360
and

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,000
i really love research etc these kind of

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,159
things and also

35
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,640
i'm a reviewer springer journal cluster

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,079
computing and uh as well as was a

37
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,320
reviewer as well with os global appstick

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,560
us and also hack nine magazines and i'm

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,600
a

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,720
frequent speakers internet trainer at

41
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,630
some industry conferences like def con

42
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,360
[Music]

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
i don't know confidence no name khan and

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,439
too many besides

45
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,280
and yeah but i'm really happy today to

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
be here at

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,119
lehec which is a very very great and

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,799
interesting conference

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,000
and yeah that's that was a

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,079
little about

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,600
myself so we can uh

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,758
go over the presentation

53
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,160
by starting to talk about the intrusion

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,200
detection tools and systems some basics

55
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,760
and principles that i know that so most

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
of you knows about the

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,200
these kind of principles so basically

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,480
uh we had a different type of

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
intrusion detection or prevention

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
systems before

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
like in last

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
10 years 20 years in the past several

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
years we used

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
different type of

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
intrusion detection systems

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,280
and also once we wanted to uh have some

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,480
kind of prevention and blocking and

68
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,400
enforcing some kind of policies after

69
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,319
detection we use the ips and in some

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,280
cases

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,599
we use the idps solution which is a

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,120
combination solution with the its and

73
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,000
intrusion prevention system together

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,360
and also use uh different type of ideas

75
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
and ips like on our

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
machines and endpoint by deploying uh

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,879
host-based ideas hospice ips and also

78
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,159
uh this is the same story for uh

79
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,560
intrusion prevention system as well

80
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
and in some cases we use the

81
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,640
host based ideas ips or within the other

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,480
solutions like internet security

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,959
anti-viruses anti-malwares together

84
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,959
within a within a

85
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,760
total security solution

86
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
and in most cases also we use the

87
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,080
ids and ips once we want to

88
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,799
deploy then have a better vision and

89
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,120
understanding about the traffics and

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,599
malicious attempts within our network

91
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,239
prematures and internal communication as

92
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,040
well

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,720
so and the next one will be farval

94
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,519
so we had uh different challenges with

95
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,159
the stateless firewalls before

96
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,760
and after that

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,799
we had uh state full firewalls

98
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,000
and

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,760
nowadays uh oh sorry i i forgot to talk

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,239
about the utm or unified threat

101
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,639
management which actually uh

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,279
we don't use those kind of solutions

103
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,240
anymore

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
but yeah it was uh some kind of total

105
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
solution including

106
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,479
anti-viruses

107
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,600
ids ips everything together in a unified

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,360
box even virtual or hardware

109
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,080
and nowadays we are hearing about the

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,720
next generation follows

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,400
so we are hearing that

112
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
too many vendors and companies all

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
around the world are trying to

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,199
tackle the vulnerabilities and

115
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
malicious attempts and some kind of

116
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,400
suspicious or behave

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,880
malicious behaviors by deploying

118
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,759
different type of ngfw

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,560
but what what would be the next option

120
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,440
and uh in some rare case uh ngfw's uh

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,560
they're pretending to use some kind of

122
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,520
you know ai things within the solution

123
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,199
so right now the the topic will be this

124
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,479
uh issue ai in intrusion detection

125
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,440
system

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,560
yeah

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,759
we have uh two main

128
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,000
intrusion detection system varieties

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
traditional ideas which were based on

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,240
the

131
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
some predefined rules and signatures as

132
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
you know so

133
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,240
uh you had some rules and you have to

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,840
update the rules every day every week

135
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,800
you know it was a must because if you

136
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,560
wanted to have an up-to-date solution to

137
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,880
keep your perimeters

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,840
safe

139
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,479
uh you had to update your uh

140
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
intrusion detection system

141
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,440
uh

142
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,880
within uh some time plans actually and

143
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,639
uh also the next generation will be

144
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,120
some kind of anomaly based intrusion

145
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,720
detection system

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,479
or even uh

147
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,759
ai so what about ai actually

148
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,919
how we can taking advantage of

149
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,759
artificial intelligence or machine

150
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,520
learnings

151
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,080
by deploying this kind of stuff within

152
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,160
our own ideas or even we how we can

153
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,759
deploy and set up or own ideas based on

154
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,520
different machine learning patterns

155
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,600
so i mentioned about the traditional

156
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,000
intrusion detection system so let's talk

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,199
about the traditional one so basically

158
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,880
as i said before

159
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,039
you had to

160
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,919
update because you were using

161
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
some predefined parameters some

162
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,400
predefined signatures rules and

163
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,680
it was a

164
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
it was a

165
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,919
some kind of uh predefined procedure

166
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,800
that

167
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
the solution was take a look at that all

168
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,000
the traffic to to find any matches

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
within the database or the knowledge

170
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,599
base which was the

171
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,400
some sort of patterns and signatures

172
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,440
and uh yeah that that that's really not

173
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
a suitable solution right now nowadays

174
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,720
there are

175
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,199
too many uh

176
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,160
possible ways to bypass this kind of

177
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,360
security solutions actually and uh if i

178
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,199
want to talk about pitfalls of these

179
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,960
kind of solutions

180
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,919
i can mention about the

181
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,879
dependency of some predefined signatures

182
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
which are bypassable by

183
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,280
some sort of

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,840
techniques like packet segmentation and

185
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,360
fragmentation uh spoofing gun source

186
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
port or

187
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
source ip i would say

188
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,400
and yeah that that's the that that's the

189
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,759
problem that we can not say that uh

190
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,080
using this kind of solution any kind of

191
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
solution not only a intrusion detection

192
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,400
system any kind of solution within the

193
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
predefined signatures within the

194
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
predefined algorithms would be a best

195
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
solution for our organization

196
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,599
and

197
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,720
depending uh on our network prematures

198
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,639
or even internal communications as well

199
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,000
so ah yeah how we can use

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,958
artificial intelligence or even machine

201
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,240
learning patterns and models uh in

202
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,399
intrusion detection system solution or

203
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,599
building our next generation ideas

204
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,080
so in fact we have to use it because

205
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,120
first it's scalable so you can extend

206
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,560
your own solution whenever you want and

207
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,160
also you can

208
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,399
share within different communities

209
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,800
within different open source communities

210
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,680
as well

211
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,160
nowadays too many peoples too many

212
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,000
universities too many organizations all

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
around the world they're trying to

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,800
deploy open source uh

215
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
culture all around the world you know

216
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,560
it's it's very important we are talking

217
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
about open source spark bounty open

218
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,560
source uh x egreg z you know and also it

219
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
is possible to take advantage of open

220
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,560
source communities uh to

221
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,720
extend the or ai-based ideas or ai based

222
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
in gfw

223
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,880
so and the next one would be the pure

224
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,959
academic as well as the technical so

225
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,680
it's a scientific research and it's

226
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,279
based on uh too many scientific based

227
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,040
experiments like

228
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,920
the cases study that i prepared for you

229
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,040
today

230
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,920
and

231
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
the third item which is very important

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,720
is that within these kind of solutions

233
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
because you're going to

234
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,760
uh

235
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
actually

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,600
teach your

237
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,399
own solution to how

238
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,040
your ideas or your ngfw

239
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,279
uh would take action against different

240
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,120
type of traffic against different type

241
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,079
of behaviors so this is a good way

242
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,240
this is not a 100

243
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
solution but this is a very good way uh

244
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,920
to mitigate uh zero-day vulnerabilities

245
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,200
or even and not a 100 percent but

246
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,640
80 85 percent uh mitigation against

247
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
zero-day attacks

248
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
or even detection of zero day attack on

249
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,040
earlier states

250
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,480
so the next one uh would be the uh the

251
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,200
speed so it would be a real time

252
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,480
solution and also you can fine-tune it

253
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
as well uh

254
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
so i also mentioned in the last item

255
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,279
here uh you can fine-tune your solution

256
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,160
to have to reach to a best performance

257
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,399
to reach to a best uh real-time

258
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
protection as well

259
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
so here is a architecture

260
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,480
before i would say very very

261
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,600
brief

262
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,200
so first we need a training data so

263
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,120
we need some sort of rules parameters

264
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,680
and patterns i mean

265
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,920
for training our data

266
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
second we need

267
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
some sort of models machine learning

268
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,480
models so we have

269
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,240
different sort of machine learning

270
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,560
models like supervised learning

271
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,279
unsupervised and reinforcement learning

272
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,720
as well so

273
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,680
based on the current status of the

274
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,000
solution we can take advantage of one of

275
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,160
those or for example if we need a

276
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,000
combination of the

277
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,800
uh supervised and unsupervised in some

278
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
cases after building the first version

279
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,360
of the solution we can use a

280
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,399
reinforcement learning or if we want to

281
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,639
start and deploy our own solution we can

282
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
start with the supervised learning

283
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,160
like this case study

284
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,240
and the third item will be our

285
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,200
objectives our goals uh so

286
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,320
it depends on the on the the solution so

287
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
for example if you were not tackling the

288
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,800
uh web-based attack it would be

289
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,040
something different or if you wanna

290
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,680
tackling ip backbone based attacks it

291
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,920
would be something different as well so

292
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
today i have uh some sort of cases study

293
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,120
on a very rare uh

294
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,639
segments called uh nv iot or a

295
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,720
narrowband internet of things i i would

296
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,399
say because uh yeah

297
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,720
nowadays we are we are using too many

298
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,959
nbiot enabled devices uh from our home

299
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,680
our smart home devices through our

300
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
vehicles and

301
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,240
or

302
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,519
it actually

303
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
involved in our daily routines and

304
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,800
day-to-days you know so yeah i i chose

305
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,760
uh nviot for today

306
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,880
and uh yeah so

307
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
the model deployment is very simple

308
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,800
so first of all we need to split the

309
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,399
data and all all of our information into

310
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,600
uh testing and training so for training

311
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
we will train within our algorithms and

312
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,120
this would be the vital part of the

313
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,959
deployment and making our own uh

314
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,360
ideas actually and after that we need

315
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
the testing data as well so if we have a

316
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,440
bunch of data we have to split uh all

317
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
the data into a testing

318
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,199
section and a training section and the

319
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,360
next uh

320
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,199
step would be uh

321
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,680
actually a model selecting the best

322
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,839
model which works for us right now for

323
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,040
example uh i use the supervised learning

324
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,160
model

325
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
and

326
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,240
actually the next step would be the

327
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,839
fitting the model and training it within

328
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
our selected machine learning based

329
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
pattern and model

330
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,040
and building the trained data as well as

331
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,320
the testing data for the final stage

332
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,839
that would be the deployment

333
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
so uh yeah

334
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,639
to do the to do the

335
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,199
testing and deploying so you have to

336
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,279
collect your own data

337
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,399
or even you have to use some

338
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,160
predefined data

339
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,360
which already collected within different

340
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
segments

341
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,360
so

342
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,079
if you want to use some predefined data

343
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,040
sets actually you can use too many open

344
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
source

345
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,279
uh data sets you can find the within too

346
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,880
many uh

347
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,639
academic section actually like the

348
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,959
cis ids

349
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,760
which is for a

350
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
university in a university in canada i

351
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,120
think

352
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,160
or kdd 99 or kdd cop as well so also we

353
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
have too many other

354
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
uh predefined data sets as well if you

355
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,880
want to choose one of those it is

356
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
possible but it depends on your solution

357
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,000
it depends on your deployment

358
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,519
so but i highly recommend to use your

359
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,720
own data and collect your data by

360
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,079
deploying uh a mirroring or gathering

361
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
the traffic from your network perimeters

362
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,040
or edge of your network or even i don't

363
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,600
know where is where you can find the

364
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,199
different type of

365
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,399
traffic like malicious traffic and some

366
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,680
sort of normal traffic as well

367
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,480
so uh yeah

368
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,440
you need uh i want to say about uh

369
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,160
a feature engineering and and uh

370
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
training machine learning model or

371
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,399
patter so for the future engineering uh

372
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,279
you need to know about the

373
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,240
current status of your project you mean

374
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,199
uh if you are dealing with uh ip

375
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,160
backbone things so you must know about

376
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,519
the tcp udp uh

377
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,759
stuff and also different type of

378
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,160
protocol types like icmp

379
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,279
and

380
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,240
to make sure about the

381
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,839
feature engineering part of your

382
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,079
solution and the second part would be

383
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,800
the

384
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,279
uh the learning model so

385
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,079
uh based on the current status you have

386
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,000
to choose the best model which working

387
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,839
for you and

388
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,759
for example you can use different type

389
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,639
of

390
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,759
modeling as well but for this case study

391
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,399
i use the

392
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,199
forest and also you can use decision

393
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,440
tree as well which is some sort of

394
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
academic things

395
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,959
but also there are some predefined

396
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,280
training model so you can take advantage

397
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
of those they're open source and free as

398
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,520
well

399
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,160
okay and the solution uh how's the

400
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,280
solution

401
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,079
so

402
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,679
well as i mentioned before uh i use the

403
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
supervised learning

404
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,160
for to have a classification

405
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,679
and regression

406
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,280
so

407
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,480
the all things that i used uh which was

408
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
uh the vital part was the

409
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,200
uh performing the supervised learning

410
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,880
model on my uh training data

411
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,200
and after that i used

412
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,760
to start labeling on different sort of

413
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
traffics all things is about

414
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,360
make a difference between

415
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,960
benign and malicious traffic actually so

416
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
after i got the information from my

417
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,520
network perimeter for example or any

418
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,240
kind of testbed i don't know

419
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,400
uh you can try to labeling your traffic

420
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,600
for example uh yeah it's it's very very

421
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
important for you because your your

422
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,160
system is going to learn it's a baby

423
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,240
it's some kind of baby you must teach

424
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,000
your own system and labeling within your

425
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,600
superior knowledge and after a while uh

426
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,720
you can see that the the learning model

427
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,919
is going to be more powerful and it

428
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,799
doesn't matter it would for example be

429
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,919
three months one months or even a year

430
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,960
to learn to have a good learning time

431
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
frame i would say

432
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,919
but

433
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,039
uh

434
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,039
yeah and the diagram here is uh

435
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,240
clearly demonstrating the whole process

436
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,039
like the data collection which i i

437
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,520
mentioned before it's very important you

438
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,840
have to collect your data uh it doesn't

439
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
matter i also

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
collected my data from

441
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,039
some sort of radio access network part

442
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,080
uh which is really closed and which has

443
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,120
a relationship with some sort of nbiot

444
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,320
sensors

445
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,760
so and after that i try to have a

446
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,320
training based on my model which was a

447
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,520
supervised

448
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,000
and after that i tried to classify the

449
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,600
data and uh review and update uh the

450
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,160
data for the for the training i would

451
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,600
say

452
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
and after that it's a life cycle here

453
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,760
uh until you get the proper results and

454
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,400
performance from your model from your uh

455
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,760
project based on your period experiments

456
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
so you before the final deployment you

457
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,720
have to test it out you have to test it

458
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,200
out and check the differences between

459
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,840
the benign and malicious traffics for

460
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
example

461
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,120
and

462
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,600
after that you can have your first

463
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,720
deployment

464
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,440
and test if it is work

465
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,840
properly or

466
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,400
not

467
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
uh yeah

468
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,240
here's the

469
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,039
first sample

470
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,799
so

471
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,000
to do this i just use the

472
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
an environment to

473
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,799
actually to have a some sort of test bed

474
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:23,760
and

475
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,520
emulating the

476
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,880
mobile network uh not core site i would

477
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,559
say radio site so to do this i used open

478
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,919
lte which is a open source and free

479
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,320
platform and environment that you can

480
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,600
use to deploy different kind of

481
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,080
lte and mobile stuff

482
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,559
and also i use usrp b210 as well to

483
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,520
communicate and send and receive a

484
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
different type of

485
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,760
requests and also i

486
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,039
used wireshark as well or any kind of

487
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,159
similar tools like t-sharp tcp dom etc

488
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,280
to get the responses and analyze the the

489
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
responses from the sensors and use seams

490
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,039
i would say

491
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,480
and yeah it's not a

492
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,440
very mandatory option to use this kind

493
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,640
of things you can use it on your layer 3

494
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,760
networks or even it would be fully

495
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,679
web-based

496
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,799
you know but i used in a very very rare

497
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,080
segments in a network actually so and

498
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,520
the achievements was uh to get the

499
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,440
information regarding the master

500
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,919
information block and system information

501
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,520
blocks which which is a a first part of

502
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,799
a cyberkill chain and tack kill chain

503
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,240
once an attacker was to perform

504
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,640
and trigger different sort of attacks

505
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,400
against nb iot devices or even new seams

506
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,880
subscribers perform denial of services

507
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,000
etc

508
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,120
so

509
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,679
the achievement was to

510
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,159
gathering this kind of information from

511
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,640
the network from a network site from

512
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,960
sensor sites and

513
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,200
put it as on my collected data and

514
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,000
segregate it into training data and

515
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,480
testing data

516
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,720
so and now

517
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,600
next sample which is uh

518
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,000
some sort of easy catching

519
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,200
uh

520
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
yeah again i use the open lt besides

521
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
srslt as well

522
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
to have a deep understanding and

523
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,679
control over the

524
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,960
radio access network or eu trend in a in

525
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,480
a radio site i would say and also again

526
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
usrp b210

527
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,520
so as you can see it is possible to get

528
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
uh

529
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,039
the emcee number of

530
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,000
uh too many subscribers and in this case

531
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,679
subscribers means

532
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,640
different nb iot sensors that we are

533
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,559
using to

534
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,360
automating different things and also you

535
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,480
can see the usage of nbiot in

536
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,280
automation in different industries in

537
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,679
critical infrastructure

538
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,720
would say

539
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
and yeah

540
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,960
they're they're all using uh

541
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,440
some sort of they're actually i would

542
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,640
say they are subscribers like uh

543
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,280
me here i have a mobile phone i have a

544
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,039
sim card in that

545
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,840
the sim card has a mc number which is a

546
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,440
unique

547
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,679
parameter for me

548
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,799
and it's a unique identifier globally i

549
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,679
would say and yeah that's very important

550
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,120
for everybody and dmz number is fully

551
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,960
confidential so the attack was some sort

552
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,919
of

553
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,760
attacking against emzy and catching

554
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,080
too many emcee numbers in an environment

555
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,320
or even performing a

556
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,799
sniffing attack denial of service attack

557
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,120
mass denial of service attacks against

558
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
too many subscribers i would say too

559
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,480
many nbi iot based sensors

560
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,279
in a field so as you can see based on

561
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,840
the wire circuit screenshot here uh it

562
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,600
is possible to get the mc number of uh a

563
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,120
sensor or a subscriber i would say and

564
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,240
uh i got the these information as well

565
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,159
within the request too many requests and

566
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,240
the relative responses

567
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,760
containing amz numbers and also

568
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
on the other hand too many

569
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
normal requests and responses and i put

570
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,559
all of those together and i for example

571
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,400
label this kind of requests and

572
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,679
responses

573
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,120
uh as a some sort of malicious attempts

574
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,520
malicious requests and

575
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,760
the relative response as well and the

576
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,520
rest would be

577
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,600
white and the rest would be

578
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,320
like a benign so

579
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,960
this would be the one of the

580
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,080
sample that i used within the within the

581
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,080
solution

582
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,520
so

583
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,799
this is the some sort of the result from

584
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,919
the from the previous experiment so as

585
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,279
you can see uh yeah you can see the

586
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,480
for example

587
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,679
uh

588
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,600
different results and performance

589
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,279
results from the different model so as i

590
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,520
mentioned before i use the random forest

591
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
model

592
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,200
in this case and also you can see the

593
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,679
results from the decision rules and

594
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,120
proposed model

595
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,440
and if you look at the look at the

596
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,400
picture

597
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
uh

598
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,440
you can see some sort of performance

599
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,320
metrics and performance metrics is based

600
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,720
on the false positive ratio it's based

601
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,080
on the uh true positive ratio and on the

602
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,520
other hand it i i would say that uh

603
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,080
there are too many other

604
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,840
kpis and

605
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,400
too many other uh performance metrics

606
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,520
that you can consider like the

607
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,120
the accuracy

608
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,880
of the results as well or even you can

609
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,760
have a false negative and uh

610
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,840
combination of false negative and the

611
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,000
performance results together but in this

612
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,080
case i only

613
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,159
have the performance metrics of the

614
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,400
false positive ratio and false negative

615
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,320
ratio together

616
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,279
and also there is no requirement to use

617
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,799
uh only random forest or decision rules

618
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,159
you can you can use uh knn you can use

619
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,880
any other models you can use any other

620
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,279
uh patterns that you want it's totally

621
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,039
based on your solution

622
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,159
but

623
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,799
from my point of view if you want to

624
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,240
start from

625
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,960
scratch i would say it's better to start

626
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,520
with supervised learning and after that

627
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,679
you can combine supervised and

628
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,760
unsupervised and fine-tuning the

629
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,320
solution the whole solution actually uh

630
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,559
to have a better labeling to have a

631
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,400
better

632
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
performance results and this is what is

633
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,039
happening uh from the uh ideas ml based

634
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,919
ideas point of view uh that i would

635
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,880
expect the good differences between the

636
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,919
benign traffic and the malicious traffic

637
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,720
so this is the all things that you need

638
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,600
to do within your ideas solution which

639
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,880
is a ml based enabled

640
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,919
and yeah that's uh pretty much of it

641
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,960
uh

642
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
if there is

643
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,880
no question and also if you want to uh

644
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,679
talk about these things or

645
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,799
any other thing and also i have a

646
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,159
workshop at 9 00 p.m i think

647
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,039
uh on 5g exploitation

648
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:03,840
uh

649
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,399
again i highly recommend to join that

650
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,840
session as well

651
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,279
uh

652
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,559
yeah you can reach out to me and also we

653
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,200
can talk together outside and yeah

654
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,039
thank you all thank you for your time i

655
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,540
appreciate it

656
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:28,909
[Applause]

657
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,880
i think it's turned off

658
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,520
yeah probably

659
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,360
now it's better

660
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,600
thank you ali for your presentation i

661
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,799
have

662
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,840
one question is uh two questions

663
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,370
uh the first question is about

664
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,240
[Music]

665
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
the criteria that you have used for uh

666
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,720
the learning machine the automatic

667
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,960
learning machine you have said at one

668
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,600
moment that you supervise the learning

669
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,399
yes but after there is another thing

670
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,559
so what is your criteria that you are

671
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,159
using to

672
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,720
to to tweak to learn

673
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,440
to

674
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,919
automatically to make learning your

675
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,240
machine automatically and the second

676
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,559
question from a collection perspective

677
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,559
or the training perspective when you are

678
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,039
training it oh okay yeah and the second

679
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,679
question is i have seen that you have

680
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,640
using the radio interface

681
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
to monitor now this is what i have

682
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,480
understand no sorry you are using the

683
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,440
radio interface yeah yeah radio yeah

684
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,520
yeah the radio intel first yes yes uh

685
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,159
but i have seen that you are using open

686
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,320
lte yes exactly but

687
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,120
is it

688
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,320
really the fourth generation or you are

689
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,120
just using gprs just yeah yeah sure so

690
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,960
uh for the first

691
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,120
question i would say that yeah training

692
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,480
the model

693
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,960
is based on your

694
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,039
requirements what do you want from the

695
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,640
ideas but yeah basically we want a

696
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,880
early detection an earlier stage of a

697
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,679
cyber attack and we just want to

698
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,320
learning have a better learning from

699
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,799
from an idea's point of view i would say

700
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,320
but

701
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,279
yeah the time is very important

702
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,039
for example

703
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,600
after the first deployment you have to

704
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,000
deploy your own solution for example if

705
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,840
you want to have a some sort of

706
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,960
experiment on your own uh to place the

707
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,919
for example the ideas in somewhere i

708
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,120
don't know for example if you have a

709
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,880
private network you can deploy it

710
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,399
somewhere

711
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:57,200
to learn more more and more and you can

712
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,799
update the knowledge base and also you

713
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,519
can see the differences as well so and

714
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,480
also

715
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,559
there is a possibility to find too many

716
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,120
false positives as well so there is a

717
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,159
life cycle there is a life cycle until

718
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,360
you find

719
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,640
that the ideas is really good right now

720
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,399
within a

721
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,200
very good false positive ratio and false

722
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
negative ratio you know

723
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,760
it is based on your criteria you know

724
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,320
it's based on your requirements uh

725
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
because it was a

726
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,960
it wasn't a vendor-based solution it

727
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,600
wasn't a commercial based things so

728
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,840
because of that we have some sort of

729
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,279
standards we have some sort of

730
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,000
frameworks but from a

731
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,559
personal and individual experiment i

732
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,440
would say that it's up to you and after

733
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,279
the first deployment or initial

734
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,039
deployment i would say you have to

735
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,039
deploy it and test it every day for

736
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,399
example and

737
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,320
check the results together and compare

738
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,000
the results and you can see that the

739
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,080
result from the first day would be

740
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,320
something different with the event once

741
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,480
you want to compare it with the results

742
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,120
of the week number 10.

743
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,559
and for this second question uh yeah i i

744
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,720
tried to use open lte or srslt as well

745
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,600
so once you want to deploy uh something

746
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,559
in

747
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,440
eutran or evolve the radio access

748
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,679
network in lte you can use open lte and

749
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,240
it will gives you the power of the the

750
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,640
communication between the

751
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,080
cell towers like e node b's in lte i

752
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,200
would say uh together and you can have

753
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,919
the both protocol same protocols same

754
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,799
interfaces between the

755
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,960
e-node b's and cell towers i would say

756
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
and the communication with the with the

757
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,120
subscriber and in this case the

758
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,440
communication with the nv iot based

759
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,679
sensors

760
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,919
you're welcome

761
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,480
thank you for your presentation

762
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,039
i have two quick questions the first one

763
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,200
you said in your presentation that

764
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,799
it's better if you

765
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,120
if we use our data sets

766
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,960
but i know for example for the icbs the

767
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,120
for building cadet or other datasets

768
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,440
it can take more than one year or two

769
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,200
years yes exactly and it's very

770
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,640
difficult to laborize our data

771
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,840
maybe if we have binary detection normal

772
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,440
and abnormal it's possible yeah but if

773
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,320
we must stabilize the

774
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,440
data in mulchik retire on multi

775
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,240
multi-attacks localization which will be

776
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,600
very difficult

777
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,279
so for you how can we build quickly our

778
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,720
our data set and levelize

779
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,399
our data set

780
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,600
and

781
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,120
sometimes we even don't know what uh

782
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,320
what type of

783
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,399
attacks

784
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:02,080
we are in front of

785
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,559
so that's the first question the second

786
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,440
question

787
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,960
uh i didn't understand

788
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,800
catching mg

789
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,719
parts how can this part help us in

790
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,040
anomaly detection using machine learning

791
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,480
yeah yeah thanks

792
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,159
yeah good question for the first

793
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,040
question my answer is you have to

794
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,239
uh use the proper data set you can you

795
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,119
find too many predefined data sets

796
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,399
uh as i mentioned before and also uh

797
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,480
you pointed to some of those

798
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,440
so

799
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,159
also some of those open source and free

800
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,760
data sets you can find some with a good

801
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,560
labeling and a normalization which is a

802
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,639
another vital part of the

803
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,520
data set that you want to use

804
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,480
and also there are some also some more

805
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,159
raw data sets that gives you a power to

806
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,400
have more modification and edits on

807
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,640
those data sets together

808
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,480
but also a good data set is a is a it's

809
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,280
based on your requirements and it would

810
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,320
be a data set from a week from three

811
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,760
months or from a year or two years of uh

812
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,880
including

813
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,440
too many benigns traffic too many nice

814
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,680
requests as well as too many malicious

815
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,720
traffic as well but uh if you want to

816
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,680
have a

817
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
individual experiment

818
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,560
you can use some sort of very small data

819
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,480
set like

820
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,200
this one and also this is an the answer

821
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,560
of your second question this one i only

822
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,400
deploy it as a

823
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,920
radio based lte

824
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,200
ids which is enabled by the power of the

825
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,680
machine learning

826
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,040
patterns and algorithms and yeah

827
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,520
the the environment that i used in this

828
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,400
experiment was nbiot so

829
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,280
it doesn't matter you can use it in ip

830
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,280
environment layer 3 or even layer 7 or

831
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
any other

832
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,320
industries like even

833
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,280
industrial control systems i don't know

834
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,200
any kind of environment that you can use

835
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,760
there is no requirement but i you chose

836
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,240
this one that i i was thinking that this

837
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,920
is very rare

838
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,480
segment and it would be

839
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,440
fair enough to talk about this new uh

840
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,160
environment and combine it with this ml

841
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,839
based ideas within the nbiot

842
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,720
situation yeah

843
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,079
yeah that's it yeah one and two

844
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,280
hello thank you for your presentation

845
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,960
it was very interesting

846
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,280
uh my question is more or less related

847
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,000
to

848
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,240
the question just before

849
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,320
is did you and

850
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,359
how did you handle if you did it the

851
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,599
overfitting problem

852
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,760
has your model is based on the

853
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,359
supervised

854
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,160
model so with labeled data

855
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,760
what about

856
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,800
are you able to detect a

857
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,839
kind of attack that are more or less uh

858
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,040
linked to what was already labeled but

859
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,200
may differ a little may have some

860
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,119
variation so

861
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,040
for instance how did you handle the

862
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,200
overfitting process yeah yeah exactly

863
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,359
yeah in fact uh yeah we did uh too many

864
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,240
similar experiments together in parallel

865
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,880
i would say it was uh

866
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,280
three months of gathering the data

867
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,040
if i would say very accurate uh a little

868
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,079
bit more than three months

869
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,359
and after that

870
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,240
we try to during the during that three

871
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,400
months during that time frame we also

872
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
try to send some of these malicious

873
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,359
requests as well like

874
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,839
two examples that i shown uh during the

875
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,119
presentation

876
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,960
so after that we try to split uh out all

877
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,720
the information into uh training data

878
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,359
and testing data

879
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,400
so also we perform the experiment in

880
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,880
parallel together and

881
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,720
we try to

882
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,079
get the result

883
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,480
for almost five months

884
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,960
and we try to compare the different

885
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,480
results so

886
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,440
uh

887
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,240
to be honest with you uh till month

888
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,760
number four

889
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,520
we couldn't get the

890
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,680
very good results after the initial

891
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,800
deployment uh

892
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,760
yeah

893
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,160
i would enable i could enable to send

894
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,079
too many different malicious requests

895
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,480
without any detection ratio but after

896
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,560
that we try to improve it

897
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,200
within a within our kpis within our

898
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,480
parameters but these kpis it depends on

899
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,400
your criteria it depends on your

900
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,680
requirements

901
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,880
so like in this kind of things like in

902
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,440
nb iot section we had

903
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,480
some of our criterias like mz catching

904
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,280
like

905
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,599
gathering the subscriber and sensors

906
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,160
information performing denial of service

907
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,400
attacks you know these kind of things

908
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,599
and we try to put all of those into our

909
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,160
training data sets and training model

910
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
and we try to have more and more

911
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,400
training and we compare the results

912
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,040
together and this uh that diagram was

913
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,400
not a

914
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,920
a simple and

915
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,800
only

916
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,440
results because we had too many failures

917
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,839
before that

918
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,720
any other question

919
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,480
another question

920
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,480
no

921
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,720
hello thank you for the presentation i

922
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,760
have one more question about

923
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,640
the evolution of the normal traffic

924
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,680
during the time is the accuracy

925
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,720
go down after one year or

926
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,160
more time of

927
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,520
running

928
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,599
thank you

929
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,359
i'm not sure that i understood the whole

930
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,680
question but yeah i think

931
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,359
you asked about the

932
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,720
uh the time frame between we uh actually

933
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,400
gathered the

934
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,440
benign data and the malicious data yeah

935
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,560
am i right

936
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,240
okay yeah uh i said that yeah it's uh it

937
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,720
took around the three months

938
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,040
because it was a very individual and

939
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,359
more academic based uh experiment so we

940
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:36,800
try to get

941
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,880
both benign and

942
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,000
malicious data because it was on our own

943
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,640
you know once we started the open lts

944
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,079
rslts stuff yeah we got the benign data

945
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,280
okay from the sensors and as well as the

946
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,920
network interfaces that we emulated on

947
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,599
linux operating system okay and once we

948
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,640
wanted to get the malicious data i only

949
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,480
try to

950
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,040
hit the inter bottom and send some sort

951
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,880
of crafted packets and trying to get the

952
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,599
mi vs ib information as well as the

953
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:12,640
catching

954
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,119
those nice cmc numbers you know this

955
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,280
kind of stuff and also for example

956
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,720
performing denial of service etc and

957
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,160
in that case

958
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,560
we were sure that yeah this these these

959
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,119
kind of things is our our malicious

960
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,920
traffic but if you want to test it in a

961
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,480
while and also if you want to test it

962
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,079
and deploy it in a enterprise or even

963
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,480
some sort of live

964
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,720
environment it would be a little bit

965
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,599
more hard to have a differential between

966
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,160
the benign and malicious data you have

967
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
to validate the data this is another

968
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,839
additional step

969
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,000
another question

970
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,079
anyone

971
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,680
okay so we can thank you very much

972
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,040
thank you mr ali abdullahi thank you

973
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,000
thank you very much thank you guys

974
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,240
you
