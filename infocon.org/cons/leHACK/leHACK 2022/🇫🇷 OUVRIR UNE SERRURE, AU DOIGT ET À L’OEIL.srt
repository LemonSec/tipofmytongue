so it's good we're good

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,219
because the funds but nobody

4
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:11,139
knows it's the effect the aces of the

5
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,870
umbrella the dingoes of the themes of

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:16,600
what the open is weird coop pro

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,449

15
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,620
you have known mr jack for more than 12 years now he started

16
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,100
with the barge is now in this

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,890
space this sumptuous amphitheater where you

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,270
can be much more comfortable I imagine

19
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,399
that in a barge even if what we

20
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,050
in bourgeois  a little in any case one

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,760
it is a beautiful evolution of all these

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,130
years which made it possible to present

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,110
more and more pointed conferences to you

24
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,090
and we hope it with that which

25
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,380
we present to you on a field more

26
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,890
mechanical and physical than electronic

27
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,200
or digital you pass  have a good

28
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,330
time listening to us thank you mr

29
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,600
jack

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,900
before starting this case hackers

31
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,480
in the room

32
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,460
some yeah aqueous skd in the

33
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,040
room

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,540
well that's good because jean

35
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,880
christophe is a heart to take and

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,470
you'll see that  he is extremely

37
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,190
gifted with his hands

38
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,280
so thank you for having us thank you for

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,340
being present here jean christophe

40
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,260
is really a great specialist much

41
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,490
more than me in fact he mainly

42
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,050
worked in the shadows so in me I

43
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,760
came to talk about a lot of  things in

44
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,250
reality it was a bit he who had me who

45
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,170
had explained things to me so so

46
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,550
here I thank him for that I thank him

47
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,940
for being present

48
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,250
so we are going to talk about what today at the

49
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,440
finger and the eye  why because

50
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,230
locks we often talk about lock picking lock

51
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,550
picking is fine we see that

52
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,780
in the movies it all works well

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,850
but in real life lock picking

54
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,080
is still a hassle on the down payment

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,350
I tried these  galleys and

56
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,150
finally the real meth  ode don't really know

57
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,350
how the tricksters we're going to do it

58
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,150
by ear with a stethoscope all that

59
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,600
on a safe we'll often

60
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,489
use touch so feel a little the

61
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:23,650
clicks feel what's going on in

62
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,020
the lock or on the lock and at the  eye

63
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,450
where we will see different things in the

64
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,550
lock we will see changes from one

65
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,350
stage to another and that is what we will

66
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,900
try to present to you we are on

67
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,160
techniques which for some have been

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,540
known for hundreds  years

69
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,940
but which are quite forgotten and

70
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,350
still locks today which come out of the

71
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,330
locks even of very high security

72
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,920
locks those of the armored doors which

73
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,760
will be decodable openable with

74
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,650
methods well finally which are

75
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,560
relatively simple

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,750
so small disclaimer we are going  say that the

77
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,360
classic or not classic but we are

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,739
on lock picking that we can open

79
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,200
doors so already we must not do it it's

80
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,870
not good

81
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,510
we must be careful what we do

82
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,769
I would say the fact not on se  locks

83
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,120
that are installed in your home even

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,920
less in the neighbors obviously but

85
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,629
if you tinker with your lock and

86
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,250
you break it and well in fact it is he

87
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,599
who will be happy it will not be you it

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,650
will be the locksmith you called

89
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,659
and who will  have a good laugh so I

90
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,610
advise you to go for example to stand

91
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,829
up pitching you have the workshop

92
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,900
all evening or to practice here

93
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,310
you are at home with your own locks but

94
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,780
not the lock that you use every

95
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,489
day

96
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:30,870
fortunately there are locks or  it will

97
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,150
work because we are going to show you there

98
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,290
the goal obviously is to make

99
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,970
demos that work and show you

100
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,829
real things but fortunately there

101
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,049
are good locks and last little

102
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:41,370
point it's not because there it works

103
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,329
it's  it's not because it looks easy

104
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:44,280
when you do it that it's always

105
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,989
easy no need not be afraid either

106
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,069
by saying to yourself ah damn the lock

107
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:48,780
let go of me anyone can come in

108
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,670
it's a bit like  times a

109
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,319
symphony of  beethoven when you see the

110
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,879
guy doing on the piano it doesn't look

111
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,230
complicated when you look at it you say to yourself

112
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,790
it's just a part are to be followed and

113
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,900
then sometimes it's still a little

114
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,379
more complicated

115
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,409
so quickly the origins of

116
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,139
techniques that we will see

117
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:10,849
fly when

118
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,500
you have the old locks so

119
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,579
these are locks that are for

120
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,048
some several hundred several

121
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,510
thousand years old we were only on

122
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,500
obstacles

123
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,810
so over there you see physically on

124
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,720
my lock I  see the keyhole

125
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,360
so by definition by eye I can

126
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,280
reproduce a key so that's true

127
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,289
it's a bit like the technique arsène lupine 1

128
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:34,470
until sambre 150 years ago almost

129
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,820
all locks could be opened

130
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,770
just by looking in  the lock with a

131
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,449
few iron wires it was enough

132
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,449
to have the right shape

133
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,949
we evolved on locks that are always a

134
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:45,479
little similar face is still used

135
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:47,430
quite a bit today we stay on

136
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,539
obstacles there are not really any

137
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,539
combinations of this kind  of lock there

138
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,580
we will be able to

139
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,740
decode by eye so there it is with a

140
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,080
small endoscope where I will go in the

141
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,949
lock to watch on purpose I went

142
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:03,830
in my lock and I will in fact see

143
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,410
the obstacles at the bottom and at the top of  'a

144
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,570
serious mast so there we are on a lock

145
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,430
clearly where just looking at it

146
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,570
gives me the code it's a bit like if

147
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:14,860
you arrive on a pc and

148
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,169
you open the pc and wii what is the

149
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:18,189
password you  press the button

150
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,349
that says the password that's cool

151
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:21,849
you just have to type in the

152
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,650
password and it works so trim locks

153
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,539
it's a bit like that it still exists you

154
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:28,719
have to know it and the

155
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:30,849
simple magic technique that still works

156
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,430
today it's a kind of patafix

157
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,800
modeling clay is what we want we're going to

158
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,599
get into the lock strengthen

159
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:39,520
slightly and we finally get

160
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,580
the shape of the key directly

161
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,289
so that fortunately it's not  very

162
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:46,750
common but still you have

163
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,860
locks like that which are used

164
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,500
in li  them high security where said

165
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,379
high security

166
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,689
we will see what applies

167
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,180
more generally today you

168
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,290
may have seen the description of

169
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,120
the conference we use the term

170
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,220
decoding by the belly we do not do with

171
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,860
our own belly  we could but not

172
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,030
every day we still have to say

173
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,730
it's mr jack jack the sales

174
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,260
[Music]

175
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,730
the principle of sticking by the belly we

176
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,890
talk about the belly of the throats in what is

177
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,120
called the belly of the throats in fact

178
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,650
it is  the part that will touch the key

179
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,180
when you turn the key in the

180
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,280
lock so there on the image you

181
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,900
have here it is a photo that is

182
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,450
taken inside a lock

183
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,450
where we finally see the levels

184
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,010
inside  inside the lock so just

185
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,200
by looking at the inside of the lock

186
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,420
we will be able to tell that it's a size 1

187
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,000
there there is no size 2 I have two

188
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,570
sizes 3 and sizes 4 2 times too and

189
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,610
I  I have no depth 5 you have

190
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,830
tumbler locks including on

191
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,300
safes including on  armored doors

192
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,280
or just by looking in

193
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,380
the keyhole we will be able to deduce

194
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,110
the combination of the key when I

195
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,540
show a little how it works what

196
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,370
is called the belly really of the

197
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,040
key of the throat because in these seven

198
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,960
parts  here a little rounded for

199
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,230
that which is called the belly of the throat

200
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,080
and if I look a little more in detail

201
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,330
I have several different heights

202
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,560
according to the brands it will

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,990
obviously change but a throat of a

204
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,850
wetsuit will always have the same shape

205
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,920
for a given brand so just there

206
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,270
I can see at least two

207
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,030
different pitches playing

208
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,410
and if I go a little further so there

209
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,970
we will say that we are by eye so we

210
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,470
are just visually like that I

211
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,480
see that  I have two different heights

212
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,240
and if we're in touch there I'm going to

213
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,830
use a key a bit like later on

214
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,570
when I'm going to put patafix

215
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,010
or modeling clay or something

216
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,650
like that I'm going to come in my lock

217
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,930
with steps we will say quite

218
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,360
precise  is more or less but it remains

219
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,670
within reach of everyone or just by

220
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,890
coming to touch but throats

221
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,330
I have some which are slightly larger

222
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,490
than others which are more shifted towards

223
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,170
the left in this case so I will

224
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,460
touch the one  here I'm going to touch that

225
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,280
there but here I don't touch here I do

226
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,140
n't touch because the belly itself is

227
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,840
tighter

228
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,200
if I force on my key

229
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,580
I'll have different traces

230
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,080
so there you see I have the four throats

231
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,030
that have marked  so I can already have

232
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,550
a comparison between I touch a little

233
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,550
and I force a little more is after step

234
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,500
2 I do the same thing on the other side

235
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,400
so there obviously it's a bit of a

236
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,690
mess with my arrows because I have

237
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,980
not changed locations of the grooves but

238
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,020
the key goes the other way so here I

239
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,599
turn to the left

240
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,360
here I have a groove that does not touch

241
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,370
this one it does not touch either and the

242
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,559
two in the middle will touch is the same

243
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,719
if I force one  little more i have a

244
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:45,700
different info and gold is with its 4

245
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,000
i  nformations a left I touch left

246
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,220
I force right I touch right

247
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,350
force I can systematically

248
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,050
tell it's a groove number 1 a groove

249
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,000
number 3 at a station numbers 2 so

250
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,380
really in a few seconds on a

251
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,270
lock that is quite complicated to

252
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,250
pick  in any case it is not done

253
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,230
like that in 20 seconds and with

254
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,360
tools that can be found anywhere so these

255
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,340
are locks to predict not too

256
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,130
bad security but we will be able to

257
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,580
decode them relatively easily

258
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,290
alas if you look at the  bears and especially

259
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,030
flagrant on the three grooves on the right

260
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,790
in fact the shape that I have there it is

261
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,440
almost the shape of the key yes and I have

262
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,810
a

263
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,210
very deep groove it is this one an

264
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,940
average it is this one is  a

265
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,850
weaker one is this one so there I

266
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,250
almost have a direct reading on my key

267
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,980
in a slightly different way there we

268
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,360
were sure really the form of

269
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,210
manufacture of the grooves here I pass

270
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,470
on grooves which all have the same shape

271
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,450
vowels are all pl  are cut in

272
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,740
the same shape so I can't

273
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,320
decode the shape of the groove, however here

274
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,360
you see it's a small photo montage

275
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,700
where we see the key related to

276
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,280
the grooves and the wear of the key which

277
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,380
comes to rub on the throats with

278
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,670
years of use

279
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,120
it actually comes to give me

280
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,060
the combination of the key directly on the lock

281
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,070
it's a bit like on a digicode

282
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,300
low over time by dint of

283
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,620
always typing the same code I  I have buttons

284
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,690
that are worn and well there it will give me

285
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,310
here the information of the key

286
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,600
so here I play a little so that we can see

287
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,329
that

288
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,670
it is a technique that can

289
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,470
obviously be done by a burglar

290
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,310
unfortunately

291
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,470
who will be able to  finding information

292
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,630
directly in a lock is a

293
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,770
technique that is used by

294
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,590
burglars quite a few years ago,

295
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,150
almost a hundred years

296
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,950
now, where burglars came

297
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,950
with candles that came over the

298
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,360
black smoke inside

299
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,980
lock for rv  like to blacken their throats

300
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,440
he was waiting for the locals to come

301
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,150
home to use their keys once or

302
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,190
twice he was going back to the time it was

303
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,360
with little mirrors since there were

304
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,130
no endoscopes things like that and

305
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,100
he  managed from that to decode the

306
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,510
keys and in this case to make

307
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,100
burglaries and that is a technique

308
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,779
today which is still quite

309
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,450
valid unfortunately because well it is

310
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,520
enough for someone to go traffic is

311
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,290
lightly your lock you use

312
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,940
your key and finally give you the

313
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,490
combination to another finally here is an

314
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,880
attacker

315
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,490
according to intervene agrees what

316
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,570
just said mr jack it is

317
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,060
indeed the case on modern products

318
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,860
as well so in the east  on

319
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,529
the building which equips you with all the

320
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,750
tools on the safe sero and we

321
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,339
will find it by demonstrations

322
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,589
which will be made now

323
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:36,750
as well by the bible and dirt

324
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,790
as well by the contact on the

325
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,990
bellies and d  so the customer contact points

326
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,720
between the keys and the

327
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,670
trim elements which are there to

328
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,190
make access less easy but it just remains

329
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,420
less easy not impossible

330
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,740
so here we are going to see the pump locks

331
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,690
out of the passive game cause not everyone

332
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,040
knows  the term pump lock

333
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,320
is generally what is used on

334
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,610
the safe and secure of the

335
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,160
armored door essentially so we are

336
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,240
generally on the high

337
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,800
security series we can expect that on this

338
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,050
kind of lock which  are worth between

339
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,020
100,200 and sometimes 500,600 euros we

340
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,130
can expect which obviously it

341
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,570
is not this kind of fault which has been

342
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,180
known since the dawn of time

343
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,250
but unfortunately this is not the case

344
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,540
there is  flaws that still exist

345
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,030
so not on everything again a

346
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,800
technique called

347
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,350
the goose feather technique because at the time the

348
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,330
first burglars to use these

349
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,250
techniques used goose feathers

350
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,320
so were a bit like  a straw

351
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,660
and who  was a relatively

352
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,390
fragile tube and the principle is that there is a

353
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,950
design flaw in a lot of

354
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,900
pump locks so the

355
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,810
pump locks I'm talking about it's my thing and

356
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,280
will be the pump I'm talking about they're

357
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,860
generally round so  that's where the key is

358
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,940
low either of buildings or of

359
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,940
safes if I take each of the

360
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,910
bars you see here I liked it

361
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,330
all next to each other

362
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,480
they are all aligned in water

363
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,360
pushed back by a spring

364
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,470
so they are let's say all at zero

365
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,010
in water and you have to succeed

366
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,720
in taking them to the right depth so

367
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,070
at the right depth it's the

368
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,750
red line here the red line has to

369
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,760
be aligned with all the notches we

370
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,440
have a real  combinations we can say to ourselves

371
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,900
that yes there is a real combination you

372
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,370
need a real key maybe you have to

373
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,620
crochet but it's not easy we

374
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,880
could have West Indies picking

375
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,170
good here it's not the case for the example

376
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,360
it's  easier to see

377
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,310
what I've drawn down here is the

378
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,070
f  wave of the lock and the technique

379
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,830
consists in pushing them to the maximum

380
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,160
each of the pumps

381
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,620
and therefore there instead of being aligned by

382
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,910
their belly we will say we have to align

383
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,740
here at the back at the bottom of the lock

384
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,360
by their ass thank you empty  in the ass

385
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,000
and there you noticed that all the

386
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,490
notches are aligned so far the

387
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,020
lock is not open because it is

388
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,880
not line in the right place but I

389
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,250
still relatively the combination

390
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,530
of the lock is there so it is enough

391
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,290
worked by  trial and error

392
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,910
where I'm just going to move my key back a little,

393
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,460
my goose quill, in this case the

394
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,720
goose quill, as it's a little

395
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,810
fragile, I'm going to push everything all the way in, but as

396
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,070
soon as it hits bottom it's going to

397
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,440
stop d  push so it's all

398
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,200
lined up together and I step back I shut up

399
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,450
I step back I test until

400
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,090
I get my opening so here I

401
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,010
showed you a little video that

402
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,730
jean-christophe prepared for us yesterday

403
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,900
to be sure that overall it works

404
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,570
in the demo

405
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:39,560
so i go lan  this and if it works it

406
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,620
seems that you can't hear me so I

407
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,120
'm getting closer to the microphone inserting

408
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,120
a slightly more modern goose feather and

409
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,940
so as to introduce the water element and

410
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,459
so as to recover all the pressure on

411
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,380
each of the bars and therefore to push

412
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,329
to the bottom so that each back where

413
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,269
each q2 bar touches the bottom and

414
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,579
returning little by little by trial and error

415
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:05,779
here we are really on a

416
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,459
demonstration the element begins to

417
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,829
turn and then turn everything

418
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:10,790
I have  to do is actually to

419
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,260
take care of the complete turn or the

420
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,910
half turn which allows a

421
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,079
pump lock element there in this case is

422
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,550
a yen compans lock which equips a

423
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,190
safe in this division

424
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,810
happened without  no problem this

425
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,250
technique actually of

426
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,260
taking impressions by the belly of making

427
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,170
manual contact by the belly has disappeared

428
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,980
since we find more of this

429
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,230
form of defect in

430
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,139
modern manufacturing procedures than what they

431
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:38,420
distribute to us the  s safes have

432
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,220
implemented so that we are a little

433
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,260
more secure a little more always the

434
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,000
same it's not a question of a

435
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,709
possibility it's just the time it

436
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,820
offers us and we will find

437
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,440
this capacity on  very old products

438
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,800


439
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,970
or this is a video that you or you

440
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,069
perhaps wanted to show before

441
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:03,899
moving on to the next video we will

442
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,339
show roughly the same thing but here you

443
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,259
see in real life in this case it is

444
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,819
c  what's a pencil that's what

445
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,998
you used

446
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:14,399
so there a fairly light wooden pencil,

447
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,540
including 40 which pressed

448
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,939
fully into the lock and it's going to

449
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,350
be a bit like a quill pen  it's going to

450
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,209
take the imprint of all the pumps

451
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:26,069
by having pushed each of them as

452
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,990
far as possible and you see we arrive at a

453
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,959
party has turned here we turn the lock

454
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,270
so there you see the notches

455
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,610
which are not all exactly at the same

456
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,980
depth but which  took the

457
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,990
maximum possible depth and which

458
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,540
allowed to open

459
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,400
and that this kind of  e safe even if

460
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,540
today most manufacturers

461
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,190
have still more or less understood this

462
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,870
kind of flaws and the bottom more

463
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,980
safes like that we still had

464
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,480
millions of them in circulation what

465
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,560
we do not change his safe all

466
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,800
the days

467
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,510
then there I showed a video in

468
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,010
this case that I took on youtube

469
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,869
but which illustrates the same principle

470
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,040
you may have already heard of

471
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,720
this more or less urban legend but

472
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,390
when you are not one

473
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,609
you have locks  its call

474
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,040
tubular lock so a little there the sub-family

475
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,540
of pump locks which was

476
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,490
used a lot on motorcycle bike locks

477
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,380
and in this case computer anti-

478
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,690
theft or with simply a

479
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,820
roll of cardboard roll of pq

480
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,410
we will be able to push back  all the groupies go all the way

481
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,700
so here we are more

482
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,960
exactly on push-ups we are on

483
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,180
pins but the principle remains the same

484
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,980
where there is a design flaw which

485
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,770
means that by pushing everything all the way

486
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,180
and in this case su  r this model there is

487
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,910
not even need to step back is

488
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,950
therefore just by pushing down we turn it

489
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,390
takes the imprint it takes the shape of

490
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,730
all the groupies at the same time and we

491
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:56,010
can open so these are things that

492
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,690
are real that still exist

493
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,270
because it's locks that are

494
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,100
still selling or if they show up anymore they've

495
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,070
already been sold so

496
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,660
maybe india is at 6 6 he has one on his

497
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,650
computer so it's

498
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,080
not there at all  the hour we are hungry until

499
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,280
now we have seen pump locks in

500
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,600
the rounds there we will see on a

501
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,300
straight pump in this case with

502
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,460
tilting pumps so a

503
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,560
French model which is no longer manufactured so we

504
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,660
can show a little  the aria faults and

505
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,900
it's less annoying we're going to say

506
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,160
here we're a bit on the same principle

507
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,810
as on the grooves, that is to say that we have

508
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:34,710
a belly shape which is different

509
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,150
depending on the key combination

510
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,440
so  what makes the combination of the

511
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,830
key is not the location of the blocking

512
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,830
here you see the blocking in  bottom is the

513
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,870
same for all the pumps, however

514
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,970
the point of contact with the key will

515
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,490
change

516
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,800
and therefore here on the small diagram we see

517
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,710
that the red is the point of contact

518
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,960
of the key so it is always at the same

519
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,510
distance from the  edge of the lock we will

520
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,620
say from the left part on the drawing

521
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,750
but if I look at the contact point on the

522
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,480
left here the very low here there a little

523
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,730
higher here even higher here it

524
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,770
is even higher so there simply

525
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,420
by making a  key is what is

526
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,030
called a variable key I put my

527
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,010
tool in the lock I just push

528
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,020
in contact there I don't try to

529
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,590
push back

530
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,720
the grooves but as soon as I touch I

531
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,190
stop and there are some who will touch more

532
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,770
or less far I block and after

533
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,049
I press everything fully I

534
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:34,210
press all together in any case and by pressing

535
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,789
all together well well I'm

536
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:38,980
going to shift everything together so I'm going to be able to get

537
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,200
my passage on those on these locks

538
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,789
so that's  is a flaw that was

539
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,679
quickly understood p  ar the manufacturer

540
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,230
because of the tools that circulated the

541
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,630
manufacturer reacted by doing the opposite

542
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,299
so he sulked one of the pumps which

543
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,340
had all the same shape

544
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,330
visibly and it is the rear

545
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,909
here which changes

546
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:02,020
so the notches are different  we

547
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,690
little more visually or even in contact to

548
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,210
read the combination on the other hand there are

549
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,380
techniques that we were obviously

550
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,750
developed to still circumvent that it's

551
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,559
a bit of a game of cat and mouse

552
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,809
like we have king classic we are a bit

553
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,529
of the  mechanical hackers or see that

554
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:20,140
all the pumps for the same shape

555
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,149
however the key when it will rub a

556
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:23,590
little like earlier the key the throat

557
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,090
it will not rub in the same way

558
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,980
depending on the size of the key

559
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,090
be careful because  that the last

560
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,620
time my wife was with you

561
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,730
panpan ass it can come back

562
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,860
but I know you like it so

563
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,159
so see her I have for example push-ups where

564
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:46,630
the key touches very little so it's the

565
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,100
maximum depth on the  key

566
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,830
and so i have ch  oisir depth 1

567
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,429
depth 2 depth 3 and depth

568
00:20:57,429 --> 00:20:58,720
four in reality it's the

569
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,580
one on the far left we can't even see the end

570
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,880
since the pump is slightly domed

571
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,460
so we can't see that the key touches a

572
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,529
little to the back but we  can see

573
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:11,200
that it's further during hop we can

574
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,730
see that it's further than the

575
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,460
previous step so there it's much more

576
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,020
subtle you need good old people you have to

577
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,549
know your lock well the

578
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,169
lock has to be worn or  that they have

579
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:23,649
been tampered with in quotes

580
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,090
with lampblack and dust

581
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,649
powder something that makes

582
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:28,059
the use of the key will leave

583
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:28,770
traces

584
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,080
and so here I am going to show you a

585
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,899
tool that was designed by jc  so here we

586
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:36,780
are over a

587
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,889
year at the camera go

588
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,250
so there we see in fact that the tool for

589
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,390
the moment it has not returned fully

590
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,679
so it does not align we see that I

591
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,059
have notches up and down  up or

592
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:54,940
down and when i put the tool well in

593
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,380
the lock hopefully

594
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,750
so  there we are not far so there the idea

595
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,159
in fact is once that I have succeeded in

596
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:06,120
reading the combination

597
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,990
we manufacture the tool we show the tool

598
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,940
with the good combination does not work

599
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,860
why my video thing so there  we have

600
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,350
a line

601
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,610
in sorry I gave a kind

602
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,980
of artificial intelligence

603
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,909
it's true that yesterday that address and

604
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,460
so it's there I don't know if you see it we

605
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,490
have an alignment here notches dancing

606
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,710
a little dark I'm going  trying to light

607
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,440
up at the same time

608
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,120
is too much

609
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,180
so here we can see it here so here

610
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,350
we manage to have

611
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,610
[Music]

612
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,290
but here we can relatively

613
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,670
easily then when I say

614
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,050
relatively easily already on

615
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,410
things that are quite complex to do  not it

616
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,590
doesn't happen in a few seconds

617
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,010
so there we are well aligned

618
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:05,550
later later

619
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,429
I go back to the

620
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:15,059
home solution if it does

621
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,520
n't work so there it's the demo here so there

622
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,040
we saw on the tumbler lock this seen

623
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,510
on the  pump lock when on

624
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,440
the sequin belayer only one

625
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,400
sequin is trial  yer of less

626
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,840
high security but which are much

627
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,330
more common during the penn test will be

628
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,559
paid and this is what you are going to have on

629
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:31,690
server racks on

630
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,850
drawers cabinets suitcases electrical cabinets

631
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,950
alarm boxes

632
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,020
so it's very interesting  to be able to

633
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,300
decode spangled locks if you

634
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,470
can't project them or do

635
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,110
n't want to bother

636
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,160
picking one should also know that picking

637
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:48,010
leaves traces in the forensic sense 1

638
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,720
like a computer so you can

639
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,490
detect  who has had lock picking when

640
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,600
it is much more difficult to

641
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,790
detect that we have used a

642
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,400
decoding method depending on the method

643
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,840
since sometimes we will not even

644
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,920
touch the lock at all it will be

645
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,630
completely visual so with zero

646
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,520
forensic traces  we will make a

647
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,260
copy of the key and we will use a

648
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,550
key that will leave the same traces as

649
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,110
the real key so undetectable

650
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,450
we have to stop the free beer for the

651
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,950
former presidents of algiers dev  it's

652
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,340
not good that

653
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,960
saleh it leaves traces

654
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,140
so how does the sequins work

655
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,520
we have elements that are all

656
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,890
identical on their upper and

657
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,370
lower part and what will change

658
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,380
is in fact the location of

659
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,820
the key button  a bit like earlier the

660
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,860
belly of the throats the belly of the pumps

661
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,630
we are on the same principle as in fact

662
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,670
almost all the

663
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,170
lock technologies that are used today

664
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,450
so we are not talking about anything 50 years ago in

665
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,400
so many  blood knows things that

666
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,250
you all have at home in the office a boss and

667
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,640
had to everywhere at freeman possible

668
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,120
attention can go home

669
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,110
I think there are locks in your house

670
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:01,909
they put locks no

671
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,070
no what the problem is  that when

672
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,510
he drinks too much he can't come in afterwards

673
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,379
so they removed the locks

674
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:19,450
[Applause]

675
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,830
so that's the same way we'll be

676
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,780
able to decode the bellies of the

677
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,040
sequins we don't really use the

678
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,990
term belly here but the principle

679
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:29,720
remains the same if  I have  line if I put

680
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,430
all my payets on top of each other I

681
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,560
can clearly see that I really have a

682
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,930
different shape so there on a real case

683
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,330
at a payet lock dared to throw not

684
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,830
ultra blatant so I'm going to try

685
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,170
to make it pretty  obvious but whose class

686
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,460
a furniture lock in this case

687
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,860
if I look in my lock I

688
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,760
already see two different heights

689
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,980
and if I put myself slightly at an angle I

690
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,010
go in reality that I have 4 payet

691
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,100
2 and 2 here is therefore in reality  what

692
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,650
happens is that I have two of the same

693
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,840
height and two behind which are the

694
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,250
same height but higher

695
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,140
so here is a side view in fact I have

696
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,600
two straws is identical and the back

697
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,250
of the straw is identical so  that's

698
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,120
really a technique that we can

699
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,970
use very effectively or by

700
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,890
looking in a lock with a small

701
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,290
endoscope we will be able to decode the

702
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,970
combination so often it's not

703
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,320
easy to say it's a size to a

704
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,680
sprint to  three but let's say

705
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,240
I have a spangle e  t the one behind

706
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,340
her looks like maybe two

707
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,870
sizes plus a millimeter taller

708
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,520
so maybe i'll make two or

709
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,680
three different keys just with

710
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,410
the same high relative dimension just

711
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,780
change everything there whole combination

712
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,880
of one  suddenly and it works extremely

713
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,860
well so we can do it visually

714
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,290
we can do it mechanically

715
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,230


716
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,690
more efficiently let's say more certain

717
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,270
there you have a tool called

718
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:57,170
incurie d'heures than a tool for

719
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,610
locksmiths for  mechanics in

720
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,540
this case which allows

721
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,850
in the lock to become repelling the

722
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,440
glitter so there you have a kind

723
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,330
of soul that will repel the glitter

724
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,120
and after I come to put my pay and I

725
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,950
come there stuck between quotation marks in

726
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,200
the notch and I use  small

727
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,040
height gauges and if my gauge

728
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,170
advances fully it's that

729
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,550
good there it's what will be called a word

730
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,850
on the n and if these blocks and so that's

731
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,280
what I have here

732
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,230
if it  is blocked it's reyes so in fact

733
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,260
I'm going  is testing the size 2 gauge and

734
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,180
I see if it fits if it fits well

735
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,190
it's no it's not a size 2 if it

736
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,420
stops it's a

737
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,340
hedge trimmer afterwards the same with the  size 3

738
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,890
to size 4 etc. so that's almost

739
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,260
infallible for decoding straw cereals

740
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:47,210
is typically car or

741
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,070
motorcycle so you have to know that these

742
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,300
vehicles

743
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,410
are not at all made to be

744
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,690
secure it's super easy that  its brand

745
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,660
on about 99% of the vehicles in any

746
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,700
case with keys adam keya little different vaccine

747
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,030


748
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,540
they are three

749
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,980
the third payet yes it was to

750
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,690
finish only if it this one does

751
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,880
not necessarily pass a second

752
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,999
so here it is  is a no

753
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,529
with the a3 of which there are only the two who

754
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:17,129
were jubilant in this case

755
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,029
last techniques on the sequins

756
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:21,009
it is electronic decoding which will

757
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:22,749
use the same principle but there we will

758
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:25,769
be sure of the electrical contact

759
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:30,369
so there in fact  the on the tool you

760
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:33,089
have contacts at different heights

761
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:36,189
and i  I'm just going to come into my

762
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:38,289
lock and touch each of the

763
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:39,489
sequins and depending

764
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:41,379
on where its key is, I'm going to

765
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:42,939
have an electrical contact

766
00:28:42,939 --> 00:28:45,099
different wines finally with a

767
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:46,869
different output so it's going to tell me well

768
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:48,009
that's a sequin a payet de

769
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:49,109
sequins three

770
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:51,069
french it's a tool that is very little

771
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,449
used but it's to illustrate the

772
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:54,729
technique we can automate the

773
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:56,319
decoding and you don't even really need

774
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,029
a human to do the job we can

775
00:28:58,029 --> 00:28:59,709
quite make a tool that will

776
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:02,109
go in and  going out to give us a code in

777
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:04,978
any case on straw is

778
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:09,369
unanimous in prog so you see salon

779
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:10,959
joins the job a bit

780
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,539
nothing specials need and you

781
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:14,709
need us like that we work together

782
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,149
we meet and then we drink

783
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:17,669
beers isn't it

784
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:21,659
I think he takes it back needed there

785
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,899
[Music]

786
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:29,049
ah ah yeah so there we showed you

787
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:31,839
things that work but which are not

788
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,879
always easy to implement there

789
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:35,469
is decoding for fabri  Finding a key

790
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,059
takes all that so here we are going to show you

791
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,549
two techniques we are going to say a bit

792
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:42,009
specific but which are real and the

793
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:43,689
first one that we are going to show you here

794
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:45,309
is used on certain

795
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:47,469
armored doors in this case so expensive doors

796
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:50,919
is  called secure, we are going to use

797
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,649
here a tool which will automatically

798
00:29:53,649 --> 00:29:56,559
produce the key because there is a

799
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,079
complementary fault not only

800
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,999
here we have the shape of the belly which is

801
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,949
specific from one groove to another as

802
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:04,259
we can clearly see here

803
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:06,779
but in  the more

804
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,369
I have no blockage on the

805
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:11,469
lower part of the grooves so there like that we

806
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:13,109
can say ok why who cares

807
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:15,209
but what will happen is that

808
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:19,299
each groove pushing to the bottom is

809
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,639
already the right combination  the bottom will

810
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,019
not be the same for all there are some it

811
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:25,509
will have to be raised by 5 mm and others

812
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:27,759
perhaps by 10 mm but as long as I

813
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,769
'm at full speed it's the right combination

814
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:31,539
and so there I have  my no need to

815
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,059
decode and make a key I will

816
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:36,970
make a key with a  part a little

817
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,830
malleable so the c1 we're going to say a

818
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,169
comb which is inserted into the end of

819
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:43,299
the key one which has docks are

820
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,269
relatively flexible

821
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:47,169
and so here I want to show a little

822
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:50,519
video that I prepared for that so

823
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,360
here is the key so  there it is a real

824
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,090
lock not to modify not to pass from not

825
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:56,320
chosen specifically it is just the

826
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,149
model which at this fault is therefore there

827
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:00,100
just by forcing on mac see them here

828
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,259
hop

829
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,450
I make you mistake

830
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,519
so that it is a technique fortunately

831
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,750
which  does not apply to all

832
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,509
tumbler locks I reassure you but you have

833
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:13,330
certain models including this one

834
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,429
and others of armored doors where it

835
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:18,009
works 100% and the manufacturer cannot

836
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,600
be updated, he can change his

837
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,070
line  production and make

838
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,330
new locks that don't have the flaw

839
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,039
but the thousands of locks that are in

840
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:26,289
circulation they are like that and you

841
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:28,090
would have to physically replace them to

842
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,190
fix the problem

843
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,870
obviously mr jack you are the brand

844
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,879
so that you know  Get out of here a little

845
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,379
less worried because we haven't

846
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:38,169
actually finished so there we were still on

847
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:40,299
the door of the house and there we will see about

848
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,970
the safe so I go through the door

849
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,409
since the safe specialist c  it's

850
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:45,730
still him me I'm here to

851
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,070
travel jackass a little but the real

852
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,320
specialist it seems that the microphone

853
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,519
works I hope you hear

854
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,190
you hear me in the background as

855
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,330
good already it's good there is background

856
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,389
now we go  give meaning to this

857
00:31:57,389 --> 00:31:58,919
conference

858
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:01,480
so I still need them but

859
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,029
tomorrow for you to show you

860
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,669
what I have to show you thanks to the video

861
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:07,659
which will appear in a few moments

862
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,360
however here we are on an element like

863
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,870
you  you were able to see it

864
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,400
above all but you want to show it so

865
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,360
before I will have all the same when

866
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,890
beyond the grave will indeed be this

867
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,710
this photo there we are really sure of

868
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,470
the completely administrative cabinet

869
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,340
you who work in the offices where

870
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,020
I worked at yours  also you

871
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,280
can  see this kind of product

872
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,230
nearby because you have collected it

873
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,790
because it is imposed on you in your

874
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,710
activity

875
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:33,600
and it is what seems to you to be

876
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,610
the safest place in your

877
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,260
workspace to put your computer

878
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,450
your

879
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:41,040
your  phone when you go I do

880
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,380
n't know me to the toilet or elsewhere

881
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,640
anyway with this type of product you

882
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,530
really have a feeling of security but this

883
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,929
feeling you will see that the circumstances are on the finger

884
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:54,270
and no longer by eye

885
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,190
but partly despite everything  go we can

886
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,280
also because both techniques

887
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,100
are able to be performed on one side

888
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,110
or the other but the technique that I am going

889
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,030
to present to you and here will be that of the

890
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,040
finger so as you can see

891
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,520
in the photos that appear

892
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,490
we have the grooves which no longer have a

893
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,010
belly on the outside which are nevertheless

894
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,590
the present because there was this

895
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,530
belly part here except that the

896
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,450
key hole which allows the insertion of the key that

897
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,690
you will have will be

898
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,630
central  at the level of his go  lines 6 and the

899
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,900
contact bellies of the key will also be

900
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,440
found in

901
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,050
these locations and you can

902
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,900
already see naturally that there is a kind

903
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,910
of staircase which is also found at the

904
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,920
level of the passage of this pillar which

905
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,080
prevents rotation is therefore if the

906
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,580
bad mode this pillar

907
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,559
comes to a stop on the screen who find

908
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,230
themselves here

909
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,400
we come back to the decoding audois

910
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,850
here each contact of the key at a different level

911
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,020


912
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,030
and it is this difference that we are

913
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,060
going to capture thanks to a very small

914
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,770
finger which goes  be able to be

915
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,070
demonstrated to then make the

916
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,550
shape of the key which will have been prepared in such a

917
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,570
way as to open without having to destroy

918
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,590
the safe or the strong cabinet which

919
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,330
protects your computer your documents

920
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,860
a little bit secret or what you

921
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,570
want to avoid  to put in all

922
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:28,250
hands so there is the structure that has

923
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,830
been put in place to be able to support

924
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,260
the finger that will feel them and therefore

925
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,668
report the information

926
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:37,850
we are on a gradation scale that

927
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,060
will carry a mom  ent where the feeler which

928
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,949
is the finger is your extension at the

929
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,469
level of the hand allow you to

930
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,929
recover the data there on this type of

931
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:51,230
safe we have known if value so if note so dista

932
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,630
t so if payet and we will try to fi

933
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,699
d out what are  the notes of each

934
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,040
payet

935
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,580
2 to 1.6 after we meet fa sol la si

936
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,790
do

937
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,700
video

938
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,190
has mr jack to hold the microphone for me

939
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,240
so that I can describe a little bit the

940
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,049
operations that I will perform

941
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,970
so

942
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,580
yes again this famous qr code the

943
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,260
efforts of milk everywhere

944
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,820
yeah

945
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,820
I'm coming

946
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,530
we have a hacker who has a solution

947
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,030
even not at all magnificent

948
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,390
[Applause]

949
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,440
I was telling you so the support of a

950
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,940
finger the dow the little ones we're

951
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,270
going to see it here everyone can one

952
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,579
little contrast there is a very small

953
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:51,990
finger the number still has a shadow

954
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,808
and at my door the laser

955
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,130
I am connected so see it the

956
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,920
part that moves here

957
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,789
so there is a very small finger

958
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,279
I think you have to

959
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:14,910
it is  any little finger will be able to

960
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,328
fit

961
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:21,270
into the lock  e and we're going to go reported

962
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,510
the information on a scale of 1 to

963
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,599
6 gone a long

964
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,490
way from contrast 1 and the hague which

965
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,680
is a little more contrast

966
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,510
anyway mr jack game anyway to

967
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,400
communicate the information everywhere at the

968
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,410
moment  where I insert my finger I

969
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,440
position on the last rocker the

970
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,569
last groove

971
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:44,730
we will be able to rock and be in

972
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:47,190
contact and the scale ah it's true that

973
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:48,839
I would have preferred a slightly more

974
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,609
contrasting scale does that give

975
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:52,740
something must  there's something there it's

976
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,200
not a matter of qr code here we

977
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,799
don't find ourselves with

978
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,770
this scale I hope that the contrast

979
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:04,579
is quite visible thank you

980
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:07,579
here

981
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,390
we have a first in notch a second

982
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,040
in notch it's really like a

983
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,480
sundial  no more no less it's

984
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,830
really a rare simplicity

985
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,710
I can't go any lower whereas

986
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,050
if I try to lift and I go

987
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,430
to our throat I can directly

988
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,780
feel the contact of the belly which

989
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,630
is therefore different from that  from

990
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,150
previous one is that it will be

991
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,200
incidentally different from the one

992
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,960
we will meet next and we will

993
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,770
thus move belly to belly to

994
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,870


995
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,400
give

996
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,410
the information that interests us,

997
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,380
namely the combination

998
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,020
of all of its six grooves that go

999
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,000
allow at this time to create a

1000
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,740
key the bear is that it can be

1001
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,390
cut from a size chart but

1002
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,330
also composed from a key that

1003
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,460
is

1004
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,780
stackable it is a build indicated

1005
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,250
this [ __ ] this poutine who  is

1006
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,440
composed there in fact it is a key in

1007
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,540
several pieces that we will be able to

1008
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,300
make the key directly on site

1009
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,640
so we will decode so there I will

1010
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,570
take the box back so you can

1011
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,280
decode one by one and then I will

1012
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,690
make the key  I really want you

1013
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:22,680
to do this because it's true that I have

1014
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,130
several hands it's

1015
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:30,440
great between the contrast and the microphone

1016
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:37,830
thank you thank you mr jack I'm going to the bottom of

1017
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,710
my safety and I'm going talent you're the

1018
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,940
sixth  in front of chelsea is actually

1019
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,000
tells me that on the scale  from to 1.4 from

1020
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,310
1.6 sorry and I arrive at the 4th value

1021
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,740
so my first groove which is at the very

1022
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,900
bottom is at the value 4

1023
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,200
I will go back so as to reach the

1024
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,470
shallowest groove the 2nd

1025
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,940
from the  bottom and there I'm going to

1026
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,490
find myself with a value

1027
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:10,490


1028
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,990
position straight we're two

1029
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,670
so

1030
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,900
messi gorge my values

1031
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,770
this line I pos

1032
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,609
tion on two I'm m

1033
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:30,560
ving I'm g

1034
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,930
ing to step back I'll get my third

1035
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:36,510
groove years old will start from the bottom if she w

1036
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,060
nts  well

1037
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,869
I'm on 26 values if I'm on my 6 

1038
00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:44,810
ste

1039
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,359
back a little I pos

1040
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,070
tion myself and I look for my value of th

1041
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,810
third groove starting from the bottom the 4

1042
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,030
h groove starting from the bottom I'm goi

1043
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,630
ng to be on 1.5 I mys

1044
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,210
lf  move

1045
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,380
thank you

1046
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,510
who follow it's great and we find

1047
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,980


1048
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,250


1049
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,460


1050
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,070


1051
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,780
ourselves on the last gorge that I'm trying to catch what would I have a lag or a finger - cairo we are between the two of us is a

1052
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,620
human so I consider  than my value 2 and

1053
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,750
sooner it goes then one because there one

1054
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,180
is less  on a phase shift so it's

1055
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,850
one and one for the last ones I'm going to

1056
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,770
allow myself to hold the microphone and it turns

1057
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:39,710
out that I'm going to remove the key and I take

1058
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,310
out the tool

1059
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,410
so here we are really on

1060
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,360
the application after putting with  a

1061
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,520
finger a contact to be decoded the

1062
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,980
belly as well

1063
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,390
with a soft material as what

1064
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,820
you could discover with mister jack or

1065
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,920
then with a contact with some raised from the

1066
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,350
waist you will have the possibility of

1067
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,200
composing a key or of making a key if

1068
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,540
you  have the ability to reproduce

1069
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,770
from a serious prototype it's the

1070
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,720
key machine and different keys that will

1071
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,670
give you the different values there we are r

1072
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,470
ally on the technique of claix has compo

1073
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,220
ed a bit like a lego and that will allow

1074
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,020
in these condi

1075
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,410
ions  to open the locks on which you

1076
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:26,930
have decoded it is the

1077
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,960
techniques used

1078
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,090
by burglars but also experienced

1079
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,280
by a d

1080
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,980
the services that need him to

1081
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,560
repair or intervene on the

1082
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,530
safes that you  do

1083
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,790
you have uses and therefore you have lost

1084
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,310
the key so as not to destroy the

1085
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,900
products because we are still in

1086
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,700
a circular economy where you have to

1087
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,470
know how to repair and maintain rather

1088
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,900
than throwing away after all

1089
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,460
it's  one it's a bit our trash cans that

1090
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,480
make some people happy but I

1091
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,920
think that fewer and fewer trash cans

1092
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,510
make some people happy but in any

1093
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,060
case not our own happiness sign so let's take

1094
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,320
care of what we have in our

1095
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,660
hands  to be able to keep them as

1096
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,490
long as

1097
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,120
possible thank you

1098
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,080
after yes that's good I did well I think

1099
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,910
that if I work as a team he

1100
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,590
hopes that you have

1101
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:23,770
worked well because I know that you know how to work well we will

1102
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:26,520
check if it actually works

1103
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,830
a priori yes it does so the key has

1104
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,490
been dialed and we are therefore able to

1105
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,420
enter the safe but this

1106
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,710
technique applies to both

1107
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,780
building locks so your door

1108
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,630
admits as safes  of your

1109
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,010
offices  i will thus allow

1110
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,110
to be kept to have a use

1111
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:47,790
for many more years i hope that

1112
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,300
this type of technique will have been useful

1113
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,530
for you for the year understanding on

1114
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,770
binary

1115
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,210
i know that it speaks to us binary

1116
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,210
1

1117
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,690
here thank you  many congratulations jcb

1118
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,050
the opening

1119
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,460
and then the right time there is more

1120
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,700
beer

1121
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,680
here you go if you have any questions

1122
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,669
don't hesitate

1123
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:20,890
or if it's clear for everyone I

1124
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,269
think it's crystal clear everything

1125
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,829
but but in fact  -

1126
00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:32,789
and I have not seen shirtless it is

1127
00:43:34,469 --> 00:43:37,599
question hello yes I thank you very

1128
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,729
much for the presentation it is

1129
00:43:39,729 --> 00:43:41,739
just a small question I will

1130
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:42,659
ask

1131
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:45,239
you when you study new

1132
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:47,709
lock do you have access to the plans or

1133
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,829
do you  have a black box and

1134
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,880
you are

1135
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:57,880
actually trying to access the plan it is

1136
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,439
first of all to do a search on the

1137
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:01,029
patents that are registered and when we

1138
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:02,169
talk about locks we are talking about the

1139
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:03,669
technique that is registered so

1140
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:04,899
is it going to be only the  intelligence

1141
00:44:04,899 --> 00:44:06,419
or on the contrary  area everything that is

1142
00:44:06,419 --> 00:44:09,399
the set the intelligence part and the

1143
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:11,109
body part of the lock because it

1144
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:12,519
is sometimes possible to go through the

1145
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,649
body part without having access to

1146
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:15,819
the intelligence therefore to the

1147
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,189
combinatorial part it is already in a first

1148
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,449
time a research on the patents

1149
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:20,939
what is deposited therefore by

1150
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:23,949
the ingenious who had the engineer or the

1151
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:25,449
series of engineers who composed

1152
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:29,409
the safety product and the theory it is

1153
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:32,649
indeed my weight of the plans in a square meter

1154
00:44:32,649 --> 00:44:33,550


1155
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:34,810
in  one meter in length I can also put

1156
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,130
a small boat on and it does

1157
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,480
n't seem like the ladder is working

1158
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,850
so here we are in the black box part

1159
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:41,500
we are going to recover the locks

1160
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,270
preferably worn because a

1161
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,970
new lock will not have  the same tolerance as

1162
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,790
a worn lock and we will make

1163
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,320
sure to recover enough to be

1164
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,170
able to say ok after ten we have

1165
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:55,750
validated the technique if we have made one or

1166
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,130
two or three schoolchildren lucky

1167
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:00,160
it's luck it's  is therefore possible

1168
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,930
but it is  not what will allow me to

1169
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:05,320
determine ok it is entirely on the

1170
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,210
site this system which was designed and

1171
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,850
produced so that we will be able to open

1172
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,800
it was the case on certain cases beyond or

1173
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,770
entirely a technique of combs allows

1174
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,030
d  go down but it's a

1175
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,260
technique that has nothing to do with the

1176
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,010
finger and the eye

1177
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,490
you want to continue

1178
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:31,940
good evening thank you for the presentation at game

1179
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,350
landais in relation to all these

1180
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:34,730
techniques for picking locks

1181
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,390
how do you protect yourself  with you

1182
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:40,600
it's complicated

1183
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,340
so finally I allow myself I answer on

1184
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,290
this one

1185
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,500
by him and even more paranoid than me

1186
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,750
but what we showed one are

1187
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,550
obviously things that work but

1188
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:54,290
it does not work on all locks

1189
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,020
so I tend to say in

1190
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,640
training, for example, where we are told

1191
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,100
quite different there is always a technique

1192
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,840
if someone really wants to get in, they

1193
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,850
will manage to get in after there are really

1194
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:05,960
some locks that are more difficult

1195
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,140
than others there are locks  or

1196
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,170
in a sense  we're going to say to ourselves it's

1197
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,420
not cool we're going to have trouble so it's

1198
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,520
this kind of lock that we're going to choose and

1199
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,980
to give an answer I'll go simple and

1200
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,050
effective which may seem a bit

1201
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,180
basic but if you look at a  catalog

1202
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,310
of manufacturers you take the

1203
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:26,900
most expensive lock in theory it's still

1204
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,280
the best lock at least from

1205
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,960
him and after that it's going to be a comparison

1206
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,550
between the different

1207
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:34,010
best models but there is a big

1208
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,230
difference between the world of locks

1209
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:38,780
and the world of software as well as

1210
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,150
software in general the designer of the

1211
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:43,570
software yvan that his best software

1212
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:46,160
present full antivirus no you do

1213
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,140
n't have the somewhat rotten antivirus and the bold

1214
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,670
antivirus if you buy from an

1215
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:51,890
antivirus supplier he has this  that he

1216
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,780
considers to be the right antivirus from a

1217
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,460
lock manufacturer that he has a whole

1218
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,200
range of locks at 10 euros

1219
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,760
locks at 100 euros locks at 200

1220
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,830
euros so already you have to aim for the right

1221
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,569
locks from this point of view but

1222
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:05,190
after  what will come into play is the

1223
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,160
multiplication of security so to have

1224
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,749
two or three different locks for

1225
00:47:09,749 --> 00:47:11,699
example if you have a pump

1226
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,709
lock a tumbler lock and a

1227
00:47:13,709 --> 00:47:15,900
pin lock it will complicate the life of an

1228
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,300
attacker

1229
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,010
and yet another  fortunately there are

1230
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,150
still locks better than

1231
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:22,430
anything we have been able to show there it does

1232
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:24,290
not work every time and we are not

1233
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,570
magicians nobody is so there are

1234
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,680
still a lot of locks that are

1235
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,119
well secured  fortunately

1236
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,249
I hope that answers I pass you want to

1237
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,079
add

1238
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:35,039
at the same time not to have your

1239
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:37,999
personal address at home

1240
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,910
and maybe he like you said

1241
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:43,170
you were a heart to take

1242
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:45,740
maybe not

1243
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,339
a question by  louis thank you yes

1244
00:47:52,339 --> 00:47:55,109
yes a bar in the bottom first row almost

1245
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:56,730
yeah yeah so how do

1246
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,759
the passes work

1247
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:00,990
it's a short question but it's a

1248
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:02,960
long answer

1249
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,400
it depends on what you call it pass but

1250
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,570
it's really too long to answer

1251
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,160
like  that in a few  s seconds

1252
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,170
the principle to make it simple is not

1253
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:11,630
the step what is special it is there it is

1254
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:14,060
the lock which accepts several keys

1255
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,760
so it is just that the lock accepts

1256
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,800
the key to key b and if you said

1257
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,599
lock well maybe lock

1258
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:23,180
number 1 will accept the a and the b the 2

1259
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,859
will accept the haas hall and the iii will

1260
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:27,200
accept the a and the dea and suddenly there

1261
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,570
it becomes a dead end but there is

1262
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:31,940
nothing special about it  it's just that it was

1263
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,290
decided that several

1264
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,619
locks accept it

1265
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,970
and there I understood everything

1266
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:42,110


1267
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,700
thank you for this presentation

1268
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:45,380
I have a question me do you

1269
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,849
think that electronic locks

1270
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:48,680
are destined to replace mechanical locks

1271
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,970


1272
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:55,029
we're in pure business so yes and

1273
00:48:55,029 --> 00:48:57,670
at the same time you see

1274
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,319
you're getting a little older you'll still have the pleasure

1275
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:01,599
of keeping your little key on you that you

1276
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,099
can entrust to the person you

1277
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:05,079
like rather than telling you I  am going to

1278
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:06,730
entrust you with the halal code so

1279
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,829
I must not forget to change it to  Before

1280
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:10,809
she changes country, I

1281
00:49:10,809 --> 00:49:11,950
go on vacation because you will

1282
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,319
always have this code, which will be

1283
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,089
inland,

1284
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:17,079
we will not be sure to have

1285
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,160
physical

1286
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,290
possession of

1287
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,030
a biometric, let's say that the risk is

1288
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,310
finally full.  aspects it certainly pays a

1289
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,630
lot of possible answers to

1290
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,150
that

1291
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,890
you have no control today to my

1292
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,880
knowledge there is not really an

1293
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,580
open source electronic lock the

1294
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,870
problem is that there are

1295
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,490
electronic locks in fact not  open

1296
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,830
source or concretely the day when you

1297
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:42,360
tackle doesn't work anymore or you lost the

1298
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,070
code or something else you call the manufacturer

1299
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,750
and you say to yourself oh well we'll give you a

1300
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,270
code valid for 24 hours

1301
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,990
it's good news and bad news

1302
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,550
you're happy  when you lose your

1303
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:52,080
password and we say to the

1304
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,730
forgotten password option but there it's a bit in

1305
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,170
mode you forgot your password ah well

1306
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:57,180
that's your password

1307
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,369
ah ok there you go  there are downsides

1308
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:03,420
remember the days when cars

1309
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,950
were  were with mechanical key yes

1310
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:06,720
indeed there were thefts and

1311
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,430
then they put chips then

1312
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,660
welcome to the world where now

1313
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,760
when you lose your key in fact you

1314
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,829
night your car it will cost less

1315
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:15,330


1316
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,290
there are always thefts

1317
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,040
and a question per  there

1318
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,660
thank you for this intervention

1319
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,300
whereas in the world of software we are

1320
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,750
entitled to the CV them

1321
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,770
is there the equivalent in the

1322
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,530
physical world at the level of the locks

1323
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,540
what are the locks there is not a

1324
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,340
database which references here are the

1325
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,160
rotten locks too  vulnerable

1326
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,340
they don't hold two minutes

1327
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,390
versus the one they hold there equihen

1328
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,290
kinda see my question they

1329
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:54,240
are actually how to buy something

1330
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,820
that holds properly based

1331
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,920
on experience over

1332
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,750
time with people  like us

1333
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,910
thank you

1334
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:03,710
so

1335
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:05,370
then clearly there is

1336
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:08,580
no equivalent there are no databases

1337
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,340
we are going to say official open as

1338
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,770
clear etc

1339
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,080
there are so-called independent organizations

1340
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,230
which go  test locks that will

1341
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:22,110
give labels that will give

1342
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:25,140
stars in ten years we tested we didn't

1343
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,310
manage to open in it must be not

1344
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:27,810
bad

1345
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:30,900
it's already not bad in real life it's

1346
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:34,890
often real work bases  the

1347
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:35,850
question is going to be what does

1348
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,380
the insurance want if the insurance says so

1349
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,750
it's good in a way if the insurance

1350
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,630
said okay it's good we could

1351
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:44,160
talk about the ethical or moral side of

1352
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,140
that but in any case in real life it

1353
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,910
works a bit like that but no

1354
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,840
unfortunately there is no solution

1355
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,430
and that's also why we try

1356
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,300
to provide information so that

1357
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,260
everyone  at least be aware

1358
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,320
who still has a lot of flaws

1359
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,940
after that it's the interest for example of the

1360
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,100
workshops the picking of being able to test

1361
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,330
by oneself she realizes oh

1362
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,740
yeah in fact it's not that complicated

1363
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:07,890
in some cases  where the opposite wade

1364
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,240
of saying to yourself hey but I still had

1365
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,210
a hard time so it's good

1366
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:13,290
but here then unfortunately there is

1367
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,730
not you wanted to say something I think not

1368
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,190
if it is true that to be able to trust

1369
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,580
without knowing the mechanical parts there

1370
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,350
are indeed these organizations it is

1371
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,610
already indeed as mr jack said

1372
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,670
already a good element apart from

1373
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,660
sources of information and  at the same time,

1374
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,560
depending on the values you want, yes, above

1375
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,810
all, what you have more to prote

1376
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:36,930
t, namely yourself, so your abili

1377
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,060
y to get in and out of your home witho

1378
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,240
t being attacked, that 

1379
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,550
lready gives you a good idea to be able 

1380
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,610
o equip yourself after you have been 

1381
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:49,500
made a demonstration on small

1382
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,810
systems with old

1383
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,920
or even more modern techniques on newer products

1384
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,430
but nothing is nothing and a

1385
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,080
bronca bowl more frankly by

1386
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,440
addressing myself to or ac I believe that if

1387
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,880
someone says something it is

1388
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,620
impossible it's not here that we

1389
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,380
'll find it I'm wrong

1390
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,790
it's impossible

1391
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:11,890
we all agree you are the people

1392
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,110
of the possible thank you in any case for

1393
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,090
listening to us thank you for these questions and  t then as

1394
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,270
for your locks well

1395
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,560
choose the best we will be there next year

1396
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,210


1397
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:28,800
