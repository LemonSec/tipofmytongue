1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,720
okay

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,880
bonjour

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,400
which is the system integration

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,679
laboratory limited

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,000
did you enjoy yesterday's talk

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,880
today

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
i give you a presentation

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,480
entitled

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,960
steal many passwords

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,840
from one

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,279
password this is

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,520
this presentation was

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,320
accepted by luhak

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,120
three years ago

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
but

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,239
one password

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,719
requested that

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
i delay my public presentation

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,160
until

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,480
they could patch

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,519
their application

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
i

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,719
agree

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
then copied

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,199
accommodate hit

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:04,720
so

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
i can finally present

29
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,679
here today

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,080
i show some articles with you

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,240
first

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
the cnbc article

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,320
listed the last password for 2022

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,640
this is a report from mobile security

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,680
firm

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,159
look at

37
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,159
they are all very easy passwords

38
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,479
of course

39
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,280
you don't use passwords

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,960
like this

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960
right

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,119
next

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
the acreage

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,560
article

45
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,040
identified linkedin

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,399
user accounts

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,479
were leaked

48
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,360
and

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,720
zakarband's

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
twitter and pinterest

51
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
account were

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,120
hacked

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,120
this means

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
he was

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,040
using the same password

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,879
of course

57
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,080
you don't

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
use the same password like him

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,760
right finally

60
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,200
the insider article published a photo

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,000
which

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
shows a post-it

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,040
with

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,840
account and password on it

65
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,959
probably

66
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,280
he could not remember them

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
of course

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,760
you don't

69
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,440
use toss it

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,959
or

71
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,640
light than passwords like this

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,958
right

73
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
you are

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,239
generally required to use strong unique

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,519
passwords

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,800
for each site

77
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,519
but

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,080
unfortunately

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,280
this is impossible

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,560
because

81
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
our memory is limited

82
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,319
that's where

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,840
password manager

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,840
coming

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,480
many companies have

86
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,799
developed password managers

87
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,959
the pc magazine article

88
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
reviewed the best password manager for

89
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,799
2022

90
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,599
and

91
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,280
i've been using

92
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,959
one of them

93
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,959
one password

94
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,159
for many years

95
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,880
one password can manage all accounts

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,918
and passwords

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
they

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,720
manage in the cloud

99
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
and can be accessed from

100
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,160
various devices

101
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
and browsers

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
and

103
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,000
to access one password

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,680
you need master password

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,520
however

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,360
to access it

107
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
from first device

108
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,520
or browser

109
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,639
you need

110
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,240
email

111
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
secret key

112
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,599
and master password

113
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,160
now

114
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,280
i've been

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,000
researching for many years

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,680
what kind of attacks are possible by

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,840
injecting mychas dll

118
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,240
in

119
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,199
2019

120
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,720
i found that

121
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
exe and dll file

122
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
of one password for windows are stored

123
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
in the user

124
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,400
folder

125
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,680
this means

126
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,440
you can easily replace the dl file

127
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,440
with user privileges

128
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
then

129
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
i thought

130
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,240
if

131
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,960
i can inject the measures dl into

132
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,039
one password

133
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,479
i can steal

134
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,639
passwords and other information

135
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,240
unfortunately

136
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,199
simplified replacement is not

137
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,520
sufficient

138
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
because

139
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
if the deal does not correctly

140
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,240
correspond to function cost from exe

141
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
it does not work

142
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,639
so i thought

143
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,440
i could pass through the function call

144
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
from

145
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,840
the exe

146
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
to the target dll

147
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,318
and determine dll with 100

148
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,319
however

149
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,360
there is a problem with this approach as

150
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,599
well

151
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,800
it's necessary to analyze

152
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,479
each function one by one

153
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,599
because

154
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,039
number and type of function arguments

155
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,520
are different for each function

156
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,400
and

157
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,759
basically

158
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,560
this

159
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,240
information is not public

160
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,479
except for the windows api

161
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,520
so

162
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,039
i came up with a mechanism that

163
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,080
does not require consideration

164
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,880
of the number and types of

165
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,759
function arguments

166
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,479
insert a dummy function

167
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,199
in a merchant's dll

168
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,199
that

169
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,199
liberated

170
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,639
liberated three

171
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,479
are repeatedly

172
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,440
increment n

173
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
and finally

174
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,120
jumps to the pointer

175
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
store in

176
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,719
the nth array

177
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,520
set the

178
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,160
different pointer in the dummy function

179
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,639
for each function as the function called

180
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,800
destination

181
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,200
from the target exe

182
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,958
when

183
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,440
exe calls a function it jumps to the

184
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,480
corresponding function pointer

185
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
in the target dll

186
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
because the number of

187
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,959
increment

188
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:51,760
of

189
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
n

190
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,279
is different for each function

191
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,760
in this case

192
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,880
the contents of this stack are not

193
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
modified

194
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
so the content

195
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,040
of the argument are

196
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
passed

197
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,760
past

198
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,720
directly to the target dll

199
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,880
i will

200
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,680
now

201
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,800
describe for this mechanism works

202
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,360
the deal

203
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,200
includes a export table

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
normally

205
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,399
when exe use a function in dll

206
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,200
it gets the function pointer

207
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,920
from the export table

208
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,959
with

209
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,720
get proc address

210
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,480
and course the pointer to uc function

211
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,480
to

212
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,600
insert a merchant's dll between the

213
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,160
target exe and dll

214
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
first

215
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,160
copy the target dll export table to the

216
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,600
merchant's dll

217
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,440
then

218
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,720
the function pointer returned by get

219
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,800
proceed address

220
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,320
should

221
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
indicate a specific

222
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,680
location

223
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,279
that

224
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,720
different

225
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,040
difference for each dummy function

226
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,240
the function pointer of the target dll

227
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,600
is

228
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,640
then stored in an array in the

229
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,279
merchant's dll

230
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,839
when the exe call

231
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:04,959
of course

232
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,640
get pro proc address to use the dll

233
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
function

234
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,200
it

235
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,800
returns a specific pointer to dummy

236
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,279
function

237
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,040
the next call to that pointer

238
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,720
result

239
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,959
in jump to the pointer store in the nth

240
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
array

241
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,240
the function pointer of the target dll

242
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,560
when function

243
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,920
processing com

244
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,480
completes in the target dll

245
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,760
it

246
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,519
returns

247
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,800
to the

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
quora

249
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,519
but

250
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,600
since no changes

251
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,360
have been made to

252
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,680
this stack

253
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,680
so processing returns to the target exe

254
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,720
now for the demonstration

255
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
there are two windows

256
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,040
windows

257
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,200
the front window is

258
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,279
the target

259
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,959
and

260
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,560
back window

261
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,279
is

262
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,920
attack cards

263
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,720
the version is

264
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,920
shown

265
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
to indicate you

266
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,200
indicate that one password was up to

267
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,000
date

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,839
at that time

269
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,959
this video was recorded

270
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,800
since the 1password program is located

271
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,000
in the users folder

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
the deal

273
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,680
can be easily

274
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
insert it

275
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,639
with two commands

276
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,560
moves and copy

277
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
this demonstration assumes that

278
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,839
the batch was

279
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,360
some somehow

280
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,440
executed

281
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,240
and

282
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,160
the user reboot the system

283
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,240
when the system goes up

284
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,560
the merchants program starts working

285
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,360
much information is displayed

286
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,079
on the command prompt but

287
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,920
in real attack

288
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,000
the command prompt would not be

289
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,680
not be disabled

290
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,279
now suppose using a user sign sign into

291
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,480
one password using a master password

292
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,800
oops sorry

293
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,760
oh

294
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,880
sorry

295
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,240
now

296
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,639
copy all the information

297
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,279
display at the command prompt

298
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,560
and

299
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,760
paste it into notepad in the

300
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,639
attacker's window

301
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,440
this

302
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,959
assumes that the information has been

303
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,359
leaked

304
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
the attacker attempts to sign in to the

305
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,120
target

306
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,480
one password

307
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,000
from own browser

308
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
the information required

309
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,360
to sign in is

310
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,480
email

311
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,800
secret key and master password

312
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,639
find the information

313
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,680
needs

314
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,639
for sign-in in the information obtained

315
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,519
from the target

316
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,880
the email

317
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,839
was

318
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,279
under update account

319
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,519
next is the secret key

320
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,560
what is a secret key

321
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,440
discretion or description of the secret

322
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,839
key can be found

323
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,920
on the one password website

324
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,199
the first three letters of the secret

325
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,438
key appear to be a3 hyphen

326
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,760
i was able to find the secret key

327
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,720
finally about master password

328
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,600
it was located

329
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,918
just

330
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,440
below the

331
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,840
secret key

332
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,760
and sign in

333
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,570
i got it

334
00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:03,300
[Applause]

335
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,320
okay

336
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,240
i believe it's a very dangerous

337
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
vulnerability

338
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
and

339
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,080
reported it in the bounty program

340
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,000
if it works

341
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,679
i get

342
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,640
5

343
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,520
000 dollars

344
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,120
the response a response from bankrupt

345
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,160
was that my report was out of scopes

346
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,720
for the bounty

347
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,559
however

348
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,480
three hours later

349
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
one password said

350
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
even thought

351
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
it was out of scope

352
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,480
they would pay

353
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
five 500

354
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
data for the bounty

355
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,640
i did it

356
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,240
but

357
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,960
wait a minute

358
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,840
only

359
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,000
500 tara

360
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
i am

361
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,080
disappointed

362
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,160
because

363
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,440
i thought

364
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,039
i was going to get five

365
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,080
thousand dollar

366
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,000
well

367
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,320
they paid us

368
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,760
so it's better than

369
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,120
company

370
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,320
that

371
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,080
start with

372
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,240
m

373
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,760
and

374
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,159
six months later

375
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,840
this promo

376
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,360
program was fixed

377
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,640
i have

378
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,799
confirmed

379
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,159
that when i learn the one password exe

380
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,200
it

381
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,240
loads

382
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,000
loaded

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,600
the merchant dll for a mount but

384
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,440
immediately

385
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,440
forces the

386
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,480
exe to exit

387
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,440
how

388
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,480
i researched password managers

389
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,600
other than one password using the same

390
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,520
method

391
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,600
eight products

392
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
release

393
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,559
windows applications

394
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,159
forward

395
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,280
installed

396
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,000
in user folders

397
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,120
two are

398
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
able to be

399
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,559
injected

400
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,440
and

401
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
only one password was able to

402
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,919
capture data

403
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,520
in summary

404
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,080
during my research

405
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,840
i could steal important information from

406
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,000
one password for windows

407
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,720
this means that if there are

408
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,799
other applications

409
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,679
like one password

410
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,880
one password for windows

411
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,919
that

412
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,880
exchange important information

413
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,000
in plain text

414
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,000
attackers can use the same techniques to

415
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,880
steal data

416
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,280
i suggest

417
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,120
you understand the attack technique

418
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,200
and review your applications to

419
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,480
determine

420
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,280
if they are vulnerable to it

421
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,559
okay

422
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,440

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,440
