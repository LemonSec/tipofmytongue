23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,440
good

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,760
uh so let's get right into everything

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,199
and i promise

26
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,280
after the first little hiccup and speed

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
bump it's gonna be all great we're gonna

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
have fun we're gonna laugh we're gonna

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,120
learn hopefully uh it's gonna be great

30
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,359
uh this is the title of the talk and it

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,520
gave me some uh feedback i got some

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,400
flack for it but i wanna explain it uh

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
when putin invaded uh ukraine

34
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
and you started seeing uh the blue

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,159
tractors

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,119
removing tanks and it's like it made me

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,720
think about

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,680
wow

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,479
you never thought a tractor would be so

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,040
good at an anti-tank weapon right

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,640
it's like i never understood that i

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,880
thought that was very cool that was neat

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,240
and so i decided to use that as my basis

44
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,040
of my talk because you see one thing and

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,880
you're thinking oh this is what this is

46
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,560
it's a farming equipment it's no big

47
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,240
deal and now all of a sudden you're like

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,960
oh now you got like the freaking army

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,479
going like oh i don't like this you know

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,759
it's like watch out there's a tank

51
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,799
coming right it's like and so

52
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,840
um but then also something happened i

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
got feedback and i got blowback

54
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
from a lot of my friends in russia i'm i

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,880
love

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,000
uh russia is a beautiful country it's

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
like i i've been to moscow i've been to

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,079
st petersburg twice

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,239
and there's an amazing community of

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,520
hackers there

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,319
uh that are all about community

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,239
and they were perceiving what i was

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,560
doing was against russia against them

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,120
that's once again a perception and worse

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,520
they thought i was speaking on behalf of

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
defcon groups or i was feeling that i

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,560
was being political and i was like no it

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
is not about politics

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,319
it's about being a

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,040
decent basic human being

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,120
it's like that's what it's about so i

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
wanted to drive that home a little bit

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,680
uh by showing some other examples that

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
uh i can get black for

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,360
uh one it's like when uh george w bush

76
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
and in the usa uh did a horrendous

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,599
invasion of iraq with no actual pretext

78
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,840
with no actual reason with actual no

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,800
justification i was one i was right out

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,080
there talking about how bad that was

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,480
it's like oil should not be costing

82
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
people's lives on either side

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,560
it's like so i was very upset about that

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
but then we get to this

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
and i did this before yesterday

86
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
but this is uh another symbol and then

87
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,360
that

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,599
example right there is the guy throwing

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,120
the shoe

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,879
a shoe

91
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,319
which is not big in western culture

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,400
but to throw a shoe in arabic culture to

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,519
throw to show the bottom of your foot

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,040
is one of the highest insults

95
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,760
and so that resonated with the people

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,040
there even though we didn't perceive why

97
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,360
the insult was so bad

98
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,680
the people that it was intended for

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
did

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,280
it was the perception of what occurred

101
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,120
even though we didn't figure it out we

102
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,599
didn't understand it fully uh it's like

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,959
i understood exactly what i saw what

104
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,200
happen but it's like but most people

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,480
didn't

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,239
but that's what that was that was the

107
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,799
significant of throwing a shoe that was

108
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,280
worse than throwing a rock

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,000
or a tomato

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
and then also you get to hear and you

111
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,160
see the bra

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
and it's like and we think that that's

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,238
what the the feminist movement was in

114
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,520
the 70s uh because in the 70s uh for

115
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
some reason uh women were upset that

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
they were treated like you know

117
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,080
you know less than people

118
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,479
and they thought that was bad

119
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,639
so they started protesting

120
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,240
they started

121
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,840
going out there and showing that they

122
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
mattered that their lives mattered that

123
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
that being a woman should not be a death

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,040
sentence

125
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
they should they should be equal just

126
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
like anybody else

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,280
and so a woman

128
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
through her this is the freedom trash

129
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
can it was never put on fire

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
that is a myth they didn't burn their

131
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,280
bras

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
they were throwing in mops and mop

133
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,199
handles they were throwing in lipstick

134
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,639
cases they were throwing in the things

135
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,199
that were saying that society told them

136
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,600
this is what a little girl good girl

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,639
does

138
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,039
this is what a little good girl has

139
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,880
and then a woman removed her bra and

140
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,520
that started a chain reaction

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
because you know boobies it's like oh

142
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,120
we're paying attention now what's going

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
on

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
it's like that's what happened

145
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
and now

146
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
so many years later

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
i find out yesterday thank goodness i

148
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,320
didn't find out before my talk trust me

149
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,280
it would have been a totally different

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,800
talk

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,039
i find out that the supreme court has

152
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,320
decided to turn women into breeding

153
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
equipment

154
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
and i'm thinking

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,680
we have i have to speak up

156
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
i have to say something about that

157
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,479
and not because i'm a father

158
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,840
not because i'm a husband that's trash

159
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,199
don't ever say oh well what my daughter

160
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,120
that happened to my daughter or that it

161
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,199
happened to a human being

162
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,680
period

163
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,000
that's all you need to know

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,160
that was another human that is happening

165
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
too

166
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,720
and that's what you should pay attention

167
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,560
to i promise i do get funny in a little

168
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,120
bit but i am telling you

169
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,759
if i don't have if i have a voice

170
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,520
and i don't use it to talk to the people

171
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
who don't have a voice

172
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,880
then i'm wasting my time here

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,560
because what's the use of having all

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,639
this male privilege

175
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,960
if i can't talk about that i shouldn't

176
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,039
have that privilege

177
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,280
it should be equal

178
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,680
we are all the same in this chamber

179
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,840
we're all hackers we're all belong here

180
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,000
we need more people to understand that

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,919
[Applause]

182
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,680
i am embarrassed

183
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
for my country right now

184
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
but i'm talking about this is after the

185
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,520
trump years i'm embarrassed for my

186
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,759
country right now

187
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,599
because you have all these religious

188
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,759
people talking about how they're

189
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,840
pro-life

190
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
well guess what

191
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
why is it when the baby is born

192
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
the fetus is out of the womb you don't

193
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,520
give up about it

194
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,039
you're not giving it health care you're

195
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,639
not giving at school lunches you're not

196
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,520
giving it a proper education you're not

197
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,919
taking care of the child when it's

198
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,919
actually alive but instead they go to

199
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
school and they get killed

200
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,639
why aren't we doing something about if

201
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,240
you're pro-life

202
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,400
show it

203
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
it's like as the bible says it's like i

204
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
i don't want any to know you by your

205
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,840
deeds or your actions i know you by your

206
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,359
actions not your words

207
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,280
i'm a christian but i'm not a very good

208
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,879
one because it's like i don't believe in

209
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,599
you know i'm just really tired

210
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,319
of people talking about all these faux

211
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,800
eras and using the bible to hide behind

212
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,840
it

213
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,919
i am telling you people are sick of you

214
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,039
trying to get christ in your christmas

215
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
if you can't if they can't see the

216
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,240
christ in the christian

217
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,039
and we need to remember that

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,120
okay i'm done now

219
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,440
okay

220
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,919
um

221
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,160
this is this is inconsequential i don't

222
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,319
care uh i i speak i i ride my motorcycle

223
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,519

224
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,360
love to travel the world uh that's all

225
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
you need to know about me

226
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,799
so

227
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,479
i am so tired

228
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
of information security

229
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,880
talking about stupid user clicked on a

230
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,839
link

231
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,720
stupid user went to a website stupid

232
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,880
information security didn't properly

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
train their users

234
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,440
you think humans are the weakest link

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
mother you put a snort ids into a a

236
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,760
company

237
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,800
put the default rule on

238
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,399
and how useless is that

239
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,959
you're not fine-tuning the ids you're

240
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,640
not trying to get it to work you're not

241
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
doing anything with it so you got the

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,519
box there is it actually creating a

243
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,120
secure environment

244
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
no

245
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,680
humans your users are the biggest

246
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,600
intrusion or detection system you're

247
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,760
ever going to find

248
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,240
because they do the same job day in and

249
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,040
day out they will know when something is

250
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,760
unusual but do they know who to tell

251
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,080
do they feel comfortable approaching the

252
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,959
security people that could help them

253
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,959
probably not

254
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,279
it's like so that's one of our problems

255
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,440
they're not the weakest linked or the

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
least invested in

257
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,279
how many thousands and thousands of

258
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,240
dollars are you spending on blinky boxes

259
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
but you're not actually paying

260
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,120
a little bit of money to get your users

261
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
aware

262
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,519
you don't give the keys to a car to a

263
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,279
delivery driver on their first day the

264
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
job said oh yeah we know you could drive

265
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,279
take it

266
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,200
you tell them what is expected of them

267
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,880
with that equipment

268
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
why do you give a user a laptop and just

269
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,640
say oh yeah you're fine with it there

270
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,399
you go without telling them their

271
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,800
responsibilities

272
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,839
that's irresponsible of security not the

273
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,360
user

274
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
and this whole mythology

275
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,680
of apt

276
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,480
are you kidding me

277
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
you know apt advanced

278
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,560
persistent

279
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
threatening right

280
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
threat it's like that's scary right

281
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,120
that's oh my gosh stay apt apt is what

282
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,360
the ceos tell their shareholders in the

283
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,640
public when they get popped by an email

284
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,000
apt stands for adequate phishing

285
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,600
technique that is apt

286
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,440
i don't do apts i'm not good at apts i

287
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,519
do bad

288
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,360
basic adorable destruction

289
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,240
i come in there and i literally walk off

290
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,959
the street

291
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,959
and i start robbing you

292
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,560
not knowing where anything's at not

293
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
knowing anybody's name in the building

294
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
not doing any google searches i promise

295
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
a company that i will do less than two

296
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,880
hours of google

297
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,279
uh when i'm doing recon and ocean on

298
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,040
their company

299
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,839
one hour 45 minutes

300
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,880
kingston jamaica was the longest time it

301
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,760
took me to do research to find that

302
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,200
information and i had helped though i

303
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,640
did have help but it was still they were

304
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
a very good target it's like but it's

305
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,440
still less than two hours i was still

306
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
able to find enough information that led

307
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
to a successful compromise

308
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,760
it's like so i don't need all this

309
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,040

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,680
and this is one of the biggest problems

337
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,440
and misconceptions we have we think that

338
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,959
the company just because it's got its

339
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,120
fancy name on it

340
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,279
that is the one that that's like

341
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,079
that's running the the building

342
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,320
seriously do you think tony stark was

343
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,639
collecting the rent from the starbucks

344
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,800
at the stark tower and the avengers no

345
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,160
it's like there's a management company

346
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
that handles the security the

347
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,920
maintenance and more importantly the

348
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,800
retail space and the office space that

349
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,959
they're also selling

350
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,920
and what does an office space company

351
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,120
what are they interested in

352
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,600
they're interested in getting people to

353
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,079
rent from their their building

354
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,079
they need to occupy it

355
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,839
so how do they do that

356
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,399
well they give you information

357
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,800
because you want to see how attractive

358
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,440
it is to have your building your office

359
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,959
in this building

360
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,639
like they'll tell you

361
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,079
right off the bat without having to

362
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,920
google without having to try it they'll

363
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,279
tell you where the main restaurants are

364
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,440
in the area so you can do badge cloning

365
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,800
by employees that are going to lunch

366
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
because they're not going to go out of

367
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,320
the way to go to lunch they're good

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
employees they're going to go right by

369
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
the building

370
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,000
they're going to take their lunch nearby

371
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
and so now you know exactly which

372
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
restaurants they frequent you know what

373
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,320
hotels to put in wi-fi uh malicious

374
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
access points it's like because that's

375
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,600
usually their guest and their

376
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,279
consultants from out of town will be

377
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,240
staying

378
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,680
it's like and you see their office

379
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,760
neighbors uh which also gives you more

380
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,920
information of like say we're working on

381
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,560
this other uh building with this company

382
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,440
and we're we had a tie-in going into the

383
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,519
electrical closet somewhere i mean just

384
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,240
ridiculous it's just information

385
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,279
more information that you need

386
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,800
but they really

387
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
really want to sell you some office

388
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,519
space

389
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,079
do you know how fun it is when you find

390
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,519
bank blueprints online

391
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
have you ever seen bank book no they

392
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,519
protect that you don't want your

393
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,040
blueprints

394
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,279
of a bank

395
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,440
online you don't want anybody to find

396
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
them i know because i almost got you

397
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,199
know i had a very bad running with

398
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,839
police in a dumpster in houston at a

399
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,399
bank when i found their blueprints so i

400
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,560
can i can assure you it's not a laughing

401
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
matter it's a serious money to get some

402
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,720
of those but here

403
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
they give them for free

404
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
there we go

405
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,600
there's my blueprint this is the

406
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
entrance way do you know why the lobby

407
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
area is so important

408
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,839
not because of that blue stuff screw the

409
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,839
blue crap right because that's public

410
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
area security guards are out there and

411
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,519
they're mean and they're scary and

412
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,279
they're big and like there's cam that

413
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,440
you don't want to go that way

414
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,519
what you always look for in blueprints

415
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,199
like this

416
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,440
you look for the gray area

417
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
you look for this nothing to see here

418
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,320
folks

419
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,480
nothing to see here just look at look at

420
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
this highlighted blue area right here

421
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,800
this is where all the good stuff is look

422
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,079
at all the yellow stuff right here

423
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,920
that's where the good no i'm over here

424
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
looking where the freight elevator is

425
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,839
i'm looking to see where the corridors

426
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,079
are where they come out of what side of

427
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,399
the street that they come out of

428
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
and what to watch

429
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,880
i've not been to this location

430
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
theoretically yet

431
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,360
this is all based online

432
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,959
not only do they give you the public

433
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
area they give you the office layout

434
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,639
do you know why the law office layout is

435
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,800
so important

436
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,040
it's perception

437
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
you do not want to be walking in a

438
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,079
building that you're not familiar with

439
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,600
acting like you don't know where you are

440
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,480
i walk everywhere with purpose

441
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
i may not have no clue where i'm going

442
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
but mother i'm getting there and i know

443
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,839
it

444
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,759
and that's what counts

445
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,079
but now i get stopped at one of these

446
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,120
offices

447
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,720
and on one of these floors and someone

448
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,480
says excuse me

449
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,079
what are you doing here oh i'm going to

450
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,000
the electrical closet uh down there to

451
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,839
the right

452
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,400
they're like oh okay

453
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,839
because that's believable because

454
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,839
there's an electrical closet down to the

455
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,919
right

456
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,400
because it makes it the perception is

457
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,480
they must belong there they know which

458
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,160
way the mail room door is because you

459
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,919
can tell because look at what are we

460
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,880
looking at now what are we looking at

461
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,039
the dark area where it's like nothing to

462
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,240
see here

463
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,119
that's what we're looking at

464
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,039
this is what we need

465
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,720
but don't worry they were nice enough to

466
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
un-gray it out for me at some point in

467
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
one of the part of the pdf so now i know

468
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,840
exactly where the elevators lobby are i

469
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,679
know whether probably mail room is being

470
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,559
put i know all this information

471
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,360
just by going to the website of the

472
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,240
building management

473
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,000
that is like

474
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
less than 20 minutes

475
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,320
and i'm also going through social media

476
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
of course

477
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,840
i love this one it's like

478
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
i just went to instagram and i didn't go

479
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
after ian y

480
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,559
i just went after the building

481
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,559
so do you know how many employees that

482
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,360
you have that tag your location and

483
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,720
their instagram

484
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,640
post

485
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
too many

486
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,919
too

487
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,520
many

488
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,640
so it's like there you go i got not only

489
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
do i have information and have pictures

490
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,880
from inside the building and some some

491
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,720
of them i have board rooms and things

492
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,000
like that we'll show that in a little

493
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,160
bit but i also

494
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
have names of people to attack that i

495
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,960
know are socially active

496
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,280
that's awesome

497
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,960
and the best part is

498
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,840
i did it while having pizza and a diet

499
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,360
pepsi on that

500
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,799
the same thing i'm presenting on

501
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,760
it's got 16 gigs of ram an i7 processor

502
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,360
2 terabytes of hard drive space and

503
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,039
it'll take over a network pretty effing

504
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,600
quickly but it looks like a game boy it

505
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
looks like it's perceived to be just a

506
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,039
game

507
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,799
device

508
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
do you know how many people let me into

509
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,480
a server room that you're not allowed to

510
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,120
bring a computer into because i got a

511
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,280
three-hour update and i just want to use

512
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,678
uh my kids switch while i'm in there

513
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,400
too many

514
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,799
so and also imagine this wasn't up an

515
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
arab but this was actually like the

516
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
lobby of the building

517
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,960
because i love going to the starbucks or

518
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,120
the cafe inside the lobby of the

519
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,880
building because then i can like you

520
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,320
know sip my hot chocolate i don't want

521
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160
coffee and it's like you know and have

522
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,799
my malicious access point up and watch

523
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,520
everybody watching the traffic patterns

524
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,000
when security changes what kind of dress

525
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,160
people are dressed like what are they

526
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,320
expecting who's more alert and security

527
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,640
than not so i can go back the next day

528
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,720
and rob them on that day during that

529
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,400
time period

530
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,799
i love that

531
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,080
and it's like so especially if they give

532
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,720
you free refills that's amazing um and

533
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
so there's just another little thing

534
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
showing that i'm actually doing it there

535
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,640
now let's go into more

536
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,799
because this is also another thing about

537
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:08,000
uh

538
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,679
how you can get all the other companies

539
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,200
involved it just shows you more

540
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,360
information of what's going on what the

541
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,640
area is and where it's located

542
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,799
and then

543
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,400
now we get to the reason why

544
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,080
security drinks

545
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,960
um

546
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,640
if you don't know why information

547
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
security people drink

548
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,760
just

549
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,840
search instagram search it for new badge

550
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,720
okay

551
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,640
search it for new job

552
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,960
it can be depressing i i warn you i've

553
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
literally used that

554
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,000
as a way to create a badge

555
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,799
within 15 minutes of being on instagram

556
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,840
to break into a company i was

557
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,000
attacking and you know how i did it

558
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,559
i did it with the badging 1000

559
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,520
no no it's a 100 badge 100 i'm sorry the

560
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,880
only way this would be cooler if it was

561
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,200
like the badgie 3000 but it's only the

562
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,360
badge 100.

563
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
less than a thousand dollars though

564
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,520
and

565
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,120
instantly print your id cards

566
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,480
but jason

567
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,280
they don't have the rfid tag

568
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
they don't have an nfc capability mother

569
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,600
i hope not

570
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,720
i've literally used a blank card and

571
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,039
gone

572
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,679
this is this is not working cause

573
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,280
someone let me in i don't know why this

574
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
isn't working

575
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,919
and they let me in

576
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,080
so thank you badger100

577
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,559
uh it's the gift that keeps on giving uh

578
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,039
to the bad guys not you uh the the

579
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,760
client um and then also some more

580
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,840
pictures from instagram

581
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,679
why do you need to do a network

582
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,280
footprint

583
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
uh when you do like that in that nmap

584
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,960
scans are noisy trying to figure out

585
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
discovery of devices i know they're

586
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
using window devices

587
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,760
i know they have iphones i know they are

588
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,520
using ibm lenovo's

589
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,960
so i know exactly what kind of equipment

590
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,400
i can need to start working on

591
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,240
now i want to prefix this

592
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,440
you know i asked this question do you

593
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,360
think where you work is more secure from

594
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
infra infiltration and compromise than a

595
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,799
bank which is understands and is aware

596
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,760
that people will try to rob it

597
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,840
that's my question to you

598
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,720
now the

599
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,919
other thing what i'm about to show you

600
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,240
could be anybody

601
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,679
anywhere

602
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,320
i hate showing examples and

603
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,120
demonstrations of me actually attacking

604
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,320
people

605
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
because then i have i don't want people

606
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,320
in the audience to go oh my gosh those

607
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,640
guys were idiots oh my gosh i couldn't

608
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,080
faul i can't believe they fell for that

609
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,840
that's bad information security

610
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,679
you learn from it

611
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,480
you don't mock or punch down to someone

612
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,440
else

613
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
it was a learning experience for them

614
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,840
and so i'm going to show you

615
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,720
how i gotta figure out which way the

616
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,360
mouse works

617
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,158
hello

618
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,880
come on

619
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,080
and oh

620
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,000
oh there we go okay here's a mouse

621
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,080
there's a mouse i got a mouse so i'm

622
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,080
going to show you live

623
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,679
a clip

624
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,159
of me

625
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,280
robbing a bank

626
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,520
this clip is less than

627
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,840
uh

628
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,039
eight minutes

629
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,080
a hundred percent compromise

630
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,520
and let's see how long it takes me

631
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,080
before i get in the front door before i

632
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,880
uh get the first machine

633
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,360
i love the look on her face she knows i

634
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,200
don't everything belong there

635
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,279
did you see the suspicion that's what

636
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,400
you should have for your employees

637
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
okay it's now 12 seconds 13 seconds 15

638
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
seconds before my first compromise from

639
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,159
walking in the first door

640
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,400
how was that advanced or persistent

641
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,320
within 20 seconds the payload loads

642
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,360
and less than 30 seconds i finished

643
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,000
but look what happens next she comes

644
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,440
over

645
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,400
and she stops me

646
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,559
and i act what do you do i act like

647
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,720
nothing's wrong i'm doing a usb audit of

648
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,080
course

649
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,000
i don't try to get questioned i'm

650
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,720
authority i'm an auditor she's like what

651
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
can i help you with i'm here to do the

652
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,080
usb audit and she's like i don't

653
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
didn't headquarters call you

654
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,360
uh i thought

655
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,880
your head off was supposed to contact

656
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,760
you that's not my fault

657
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,600
uh can you and she's like can you talk

658
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,679
to the uh head manager and i'm like sure

659
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,000
no problem that would be great

660
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,760
so she did everything right

661
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,600
except for this part

662
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,480
pardoned she says like and then i

663
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,880
dismiss her i say i'll stand by i assure

664
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,159
that i'm going to go talk to him

665
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,159
now

666
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,480
he thinks that she vetted me

667
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,880
that she thought i was legit and brother

668
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,919
and now

669
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,640
he's just going along with it

670
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,360
i call that a conversation in the middle

671
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,320
attack

672
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,240
because it's like i make one person say

673
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,679
one thing's going on and the other

674
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,600
person perceives something else happen

675
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,120
when they're right there talking to each

676
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,320
other

677
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,400
so now i'm compromised his machine

678
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,880
and now i ask him to escort me to the

679
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,600
rest of the bank

680
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,080
oh and i realized i want to attack the

681
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,480
data center first let's let's get the

682
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,440
data center right off the bat okay

683
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,880
because you know the teller line's fun

684
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,799
and everything but it's even better when

685
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,240
you get the data center that's my

686
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,159
trusted agent he's someone that's to

687
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,799
vouch for me if i get caught uh and be

688
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,240
there to help me out he's a little too

689
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
happy because he can't believe what's

690
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,960
going on either

691
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400
so i have to tell him he's like get the

692
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,600
back dude he's like you're not supposed

693
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,080
to know me it's like and so now he uh he

694
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,639
walks up

695
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,679
slowly

696
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,400
i i didn't edit this at all this is

697
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
literally the whole thing that would

698
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,439
happen uh so

699
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,960
and we get to the data center and he

700
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,440
puts in a very secure key code i'm a

701
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
walking talking google street streetcar

702
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,760
when i'm in an engagement i've got a uh

703
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,600
watches i've got pens i've got all these

704
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
video recorders it's like so i could

705
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,039
have easily gotten what that date that

706
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,480
thing was but he was nice enough to open

707
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
the door for me uh and now here's the

708
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,600
part i'll be down there in a second uh

709
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,480
to go to the teller line so i'm like

710
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,200
he left me alone in the data center

711
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,919
and the problem is you can't hear

712
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,120
the sadness in my voice

713
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
as i sigh

714
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,840
like

715
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
why am i in here underscore this is not

716
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,360
good this was a bad thing uh so but then

717
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,679
i realized he's really too good to let

718
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,400
go

719
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,799
it's like hold on i'm coming

720
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,158
let's go to the teller line now

721
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,600
so he helps me he helps get me to the

722
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,158
teller line

723
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,520
and yes i apologize to the camera people

724
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,960
that have to like you know keep track of

725
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,120
me as i'm walking around the stage

726
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,678
oh they're good

727
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,720
okay

728
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,760
so i start compromising the teller line

729
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,840
the manager is right behind me how am i

730
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,879
not supposed to be there

731
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,320
now this one part was i'm not being

732
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,960
petty i'm i promise you okay

733
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,919
but

734
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,200
this rude

735
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
employee

736
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,159
locked his workstation when he went on a

737
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,000
break

738
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,799
who does that

739
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,039
it's like there's a lot i mean so i had

740
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,399
to go get the manager to go get the

741
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,640
employee to unlock the workstation for

742
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,080
me because i want to get 100

743
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,529
[Applause]

744
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,039
yes i i respect the french language too

745
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,360
much to speak it it's like but it was

746
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,559
very horrible it's like

747
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,399
and so there you go like this there's

748
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,279
good i got all those and now i want to

749
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,919
go to the vault

750
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,360
people don't realize once again

751
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,520
perception the vault's not that big

752
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,799
shiny metal thing you see in movies

753
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,480
we're about to go visit the vault

754
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,080
the vault

755
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,279
is where the wire transfers happen

756
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,559
it's where the money is moved

757
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,520
oh it's getting real up in here now

758
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,159
the managers right beside me

759
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,919
while they're in the middle of doing

760
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,240
wire transfers

761
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,320
my code executes

762
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,720
it's just notepad i'm not trying to be a

763
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,880
bad person it's like i'm not a criminal

764
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
i'm a hacker it's like i'm trying to

765
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,039
just uh do a notepad to show them that

766
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,640
the exploit could work

767
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
so i got in got out

768
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,520
now

769
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,080
i have to confess

770
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,640
i mentioned that i was petty

771
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,760
so

772
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,360
i had to make sure

773
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
that i got the girl that stopped me at

774
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,440
the very beginning and compromised her

775
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,679
machine too just out of principle

776
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,720
ah

777
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,360
so with the manager now beside me making

778
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,158
everything okay

779
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,600
i get her up out of her chair

780
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,559
and i compromise that machine as well

781
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,039
so i've compromised a hundred percent of

782
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,200
the machines

783
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,279
i'm just rambling i'm just talking i'm

784
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,799
smiling i'm being funny

785
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,720
being polite oh i unplugged that let me

786
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,799
plug it back in for you so you know i

787
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,880
didn't want to do that and i did

788
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,760
appreciate their help

789
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,199
and then this was my honest reaction

790
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,159
how did that just happen i was more

791
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,120
surprised anybody else

792
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,080
can you please explain to me

793
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,200
where

794
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,559
oh let's go to the next one oops there

795
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,320
we go so where

796
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,960
can you tell me

797
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,840
that i was advanced

798
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,720
where can you tell me i was being

799
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,360
persistent

800
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,679
we need to stop looking like these

801
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,919
attacks are well orchestrated or going

802
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,440
to be like they have you have to have

803
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,039
all these techniques and you all have

804
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,240
all these things if this is so easy i

805
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,720
can do it

806
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,760
that should scare you

807
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,919
i've got really bad adhd on the spectrum

808
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,760
it's like trust me i can barely organize

809
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,840
what my email folder looks like and i'm

810
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,919
robin banks

811
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,159
that's a problem with the people

812
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,640
not a compliment on how good my skills

813
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,799
are

814
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,519
we need to get better at protecting our

815
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,200
people

816
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,880
and here's where we go here's where i

817
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
talk about perception

818
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,559
because watch this video

819
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,360
i walk in

820
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
i'm coming from the public area but i

821
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,679
immediately turned left

822
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,279
to where the lady is sitting down but

823
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,919
she's on the phone but i don't go to her

824
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,840
i just stay hidden behind the column

825
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,279
i stay there for a few seconds

826
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,440
and then i walk around

827
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,000
like i had been talking to that lady and

828
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,799
now i'm coming from a trusted side

829
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,399
i'm coming from the private side

830
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,279
and so i walk in

831
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,799
if i would have come in

832
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,880
straight into the to the lot from the

833
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,519
lobby to behind the teller line

834
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,480
i would have had a bad day

835
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,240
they would have been like what's going

836
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,120
on that machine's not even plugged in

837
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,919
but i had to start the process

838
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,360
because then i could go to the next one

839
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,559
going i'm doing usb audit

840
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,399
i love usb audits i don't know what they

841
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,439
are but i love them

842
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,799
everybody passes my usb audits though by

843
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,639
the way so win-win for everyone

844
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,559
now this she wouldn't have me so i'm

845
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:55,679
just spinning around in the chair

846
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,080
because i'm just a go lucky you know guy

847
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,000
i'm not doing anything bad criminals

848
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,440
don't you know spin around in the chair

849
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
when they're waiting to rob someone

850
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,600
except for me

851
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,600
and i pop it up

852
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,360
and there we go so the key thing here

853
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,120
is all about

854
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,840
perception

855
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,880
they perceived me

856
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
as an internal person

857
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
because of the direction that i came and

858
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
after enough a time

859
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,519
it's like they perceived me as

860
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,000
okay

861
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,080
how many i and trust me it's not just

862
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,279
this location it's not just this country

863
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,000
or this industry or this people

864
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,600
it is literally

865
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,440
it's like every place i've been

866
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,240
i have robbed banks in jamaica i've

867
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,640
robbed banks of the u.s

868
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,120
in the u.s oh my gosh i had a great one

869
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,600
i robbed a bank there

870
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,559
by literally signing in

871
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,720
as a vendor

872
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,480
at the front desk

873
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,200
i used a fake name

874
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,800
that i did not have a license where i

875
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
had no

876
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,800
id i've got some fake ids didn't use any

877
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,040
of them

878
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,399
i

879
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,599
signed in with a fake company name

880
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,879
that if anybody would have checked

881
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,079
they'd be like i came in as an

882
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,520
electrical company

883
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,159
and then um because i had a pump plug

884
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,000
and i was doing storage protections and

885
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,119
making sure that all that because we're

886
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,119
having brownouts at headquarters so we

887
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:32,639
need to to have those monitoring

888
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,399
equipment and the voltage

889
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,679
and so

890
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,719
i got that and then i used a fake phone

891
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,800
number

892
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,560
that i don't even if it worked

893
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,440
they let me in

894
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,760
i got the manager to get out of their

895
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,639
desk off their uh behind their desk so i

896
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,199
could plug the device into their uh

897
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,119
underneath their desk

898
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,800
did i have to do it there

899
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,560
no but i thought it was funny at the

900
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,200
time it's like and so that's why i did

901
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,720
that one

902
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,960
but that was like they didn't they

903
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,400
didn't even check the names

904
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,040
it's like so and i mean and i look i

905
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,280
mean i was wearing it's like i'm in i'm

906
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,359
on the west coast of america right now

907
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,800
i'm wearing

908
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,599
a work shirt a blue work shirt that

909
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,359
literally says defcon on it

910
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:27,680
and i come with warning labels okay

911
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,839
always

912
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,079
so you got to understand

913
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,520
that you can't make excuses saying

914
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,240
oh but that was them

915
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,760
no that's going to be you

916
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,880
or it has been you

917
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,839
and you just don't know it

918
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,040
so we need to get better at treating our

919
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,880
people as allies and part of our team

920
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,280
than liabilities

921
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,119
so after this after seeing this you sure

922
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,599
hope so but you're probably not

923
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,680
because once again like i said we're

924
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,079
dealing with perception

925
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,599
what people see

926
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,400
or what they want to see because

927
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,960
sometimes humans don't like

928
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
seeing things

929
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,000
we don't like reality so we want to find

930
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
a perception or something that matches

931
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,480
our own

932
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,040
that is too topical right now it's like

933
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,720
so we go there and we find that

934
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,079
information and we get those sources

935
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,520
like the blue and black dress remember

936
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,280
that that whole thing hysteria that hit

937
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
the internet

938
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,400
if you don't

939
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,560
you're so lucky congratulations

940
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,520
um

941
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,960
so let's talk a little bit more about

942
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,200
make it more about us right more about

943
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,680
hacking more about breaking into places

944
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
this guy

945
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,960
this is me

946
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,240
uh robbing uh one location

947
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,440
it's like

948
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,800
going in as a what i call my a

949
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,119
assertive role and also going in as my

950
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,720
passive role

951
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,200
how long do you think

952
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,520
uh the time had passed between these two

953
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,920
pictures

954
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,200
the next day

955
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,240
the next day

956
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
i go in

957
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,440
as the passive role

958
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,200
with my little you know prox mark

959
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,480
scanner and and my usb recording glasses

960
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,000
and a couple other little gadgets and

961
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,800
goodies as your company's computer guy

962
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,320
and then after i do the recon after i do

963
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,400
everything or or compromise as much as i

964
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,040
can the next day

965
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,119
i clean up a little bit as much as i can

966
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,720
anyway and i show up as

967
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,320
the auditor

968
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,960
now the tricky thing about this

969
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,520
is people are going to sort of remember

970
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,320
me from the day before

971
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,760
but oh

972
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,960
he looks vaguely familiar

973
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,880
because they're not connecting because

974
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,880
i've changed my appearance

975
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,720
and the other can you tell what the

976
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,839
biggest

977
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:08,640
thing

978
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,800
in perception that gets me into a

979
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,839
location like this

980
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,839
look behind me

981
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:16,839
it's

982
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,400
winter it's nose on the ground

983
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,960
even when i'm in a short sleeve shirt do

984
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,400
you see me wearing a jacket

985
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,320
i had to walk three blocks in the snow

986
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,839
freezing my butt off

987
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,200
but why

988
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,079
why did i do that

989
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,320
basic perception

990
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,200
you can't act like you're trusted

991
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,599
like you're an inside employee

992
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,599
if you've got an outside jacket on

993
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,079
so you show up

994
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,240
without a jacket

995
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,160
and oh he must have put his jacket in

996
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,480
the conference room or he must belong

997
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,400
here or what kind of idiot would you

998
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,040
know go to work without a jacket on

999
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,839
right it's like that's how that works

1000
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,680
it's just basic perception this is not

1001
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,880
social engineering

1002
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,000
this is basic human nature

1003
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,480
i am not a great social engineer i'm

1004
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,520
really good at masking and understanding

1005
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,839
human behavior

1006
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,079
that is what gets me it's like who knew

1007
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,760
survival instincts from childhood would

1008
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,520
pay off so well

1009
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,960
these are some of the other roles that i

1010
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,560
use i love i love my homeless person uh

1011
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,000
role that's dear to me because i used to

1012
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,079
live behind a dumpster uh it's like i

1013
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,520
never begged for money though it's like

1014
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,680
i just scavenged but still and then i

1015
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,160
got the work guy and i got my other role

1016
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,599
the assertive role

1017
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,920
uh the one thing in common i'm all

1018
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,440
trying i'm trying to rob you with all of

1019
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,119
them

1020
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,040
so so that is fun

1021
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,800
it's like i love the cardboard because

1022
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,359
who pays attention to homeless people

1023
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,880
who actually looks one of them in the

1024
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,480
face

1025
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,480
it's like it's the perfect way to rob

1026
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,359
people

1027
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,440
it's like trust me i oh no i won't say

1028
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,119
that it's like i'm gonna say i know but

1029
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,000
it's like i don't know no but i've heard

1030
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,839
i've never robbed people uh unless they

1031
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,119
paid me first

1032
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,599
um that did not sound convincing but i

1033
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,760
actually was i was actually being honest

1034
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,640
so

1035
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,000
assertive roles do not mean aggressive

1036
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,520
what mana original and pretext are

1037
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,680
involved hardwood use can be limited but

1038
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,040
the more discreet the better your

1039
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,400
chances are of success

1040
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,079
if you notice i came in a suit in the

1041
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,200
bank and so i had just a usb drive

1042
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,640

1043
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,359
a regular usb drive

1044

come in uh when i'm doing the assertive

1047
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,079
role i don't want it to be too flashy i

1048
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,839
don't want to be too technical i don't

1049
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,000
want to provoke that much notice

1050
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,280
it's like and the other thing is

1051
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,119
i'm going to be assertive i'm not going

1052
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:52,480
to be rude

1053
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,359
there's only one time and we'll just say

1054
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,000
it was in a european country uh where

1055
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,920
people were a lot more used to like you

1056
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,640
know directness and uh and i'm not even

1059
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,839
okay but so i go in there and i'm found

1060

i get stopped

1062
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,280
very assertively

1063
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
well what happens when you're approached

1064
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,640
assertively

1065
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,880
by someone when you're not where you're

1066
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,599
supposed to be

1067
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,920
you respond

1068
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,240
more assertively

1069
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,599
yes i'm here doing the surprise

1070
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,520
inspection they freaking pulled me out

1071
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,440
of new york's office to come over here

1072
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,800
to see what was going on and i have to

1073
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,040
do some private section it's like

1074
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,200

1075

1077
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,920
uh well you know

1078
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,839
what part of the prize inspector did you

1079
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,839

names of people who fail only the people

1086
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,200
who succeed because that's how you teach

1087
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,800
people to be better

1088
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,280

1094
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,680
my suit he thought i was a magician

1095
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,599
when i asked him how i when i told him

1096
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,359

1097
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,040

1098
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
i'm not a magician

1099
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,359
it's like magicians always say

1100
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,520
there's nothing up my sleeves

1101
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,359
and i specifically told you to put

1102
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,079
something up my sleeves

1103
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,319
so yes those are my two bash bunnies and

1104
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,839
my my little pocket sleeves

1105
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:47,119
are they

1106
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,359
are they really useful there

1107
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,240
no

1108
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,839
but is it cool

1109
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,160
yes

1110
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,880
and sometimes that's all it counts

1111
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,880
[Applause]

1112
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,839
now

1113
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,319
can we see the three hacking devices in

1114
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,960
this picture

1115
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,160
i mean the first one is easy the usb

1116
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,200
pin

1117
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,800
video recorder

1118
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
but then we've got the high def video

1119
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
camera and the watch with the 16 gig

1120
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,040
hard drive with an easy to attach cable

1121
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,440
so i could download 16 gigs of your data

1122
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,040
and walk out on my watch no one's i mean

1123
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,599
who's going to notice that right

1124
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,839
but it's not a rolex but and then my

1125
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:30,960
favorite

1126
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,079
my favorite because i told peter i said

1127
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,119
peter

1128
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,680
i want to have french cuffs

1129
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,440
on all my shirts

1130
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,680
and he's like oh you like cufflinks i

1131
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,160
was like well i like to be fancy okay

1132
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,440
that's why they call them french cuffs

1133
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,839
they're fancy it's like

1134
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,200
no i want them for this

1135
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,760
one

1136
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,480
usb is a wi-fi adapter

1137
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,200
so i've just turned your server

1138
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,599
into a wireless access point for me to

1139
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,960
connect to

1140
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,200
and download all your data from your

1141
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,680
internal network and broadcast it out

1142
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,240
into the parking lot

1143
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,520
then the other one is oh don't worry

1144
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,000
that's the usb drive that has all the

1145
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,680
drivers for windows linux and mac

1146
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,800
so i can

1147
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,520
load the wireless adapter and plus maybe

1148
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,599
some malware here and there it's like if

1149
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,599
needed but don't worry i don't write

1150
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,599
anything to that that cuff link it's

1151
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,480
like i'm just writing to your drive

1152
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,920
and writing to your network the the the

1153
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,920
the the receiving part comes later

1154
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,760
also i have pockets

1155
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,599
i love pockets

1156
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,960
women understand pockets

1157
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,040
why is it with western society it's like

1158
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,200
women can't have pockets men can't have

1159
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,760
purses but i love my purse it's like

1160
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,319
it's like it's got all my stuff in it

1161
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,720
so it's like i've got pockets and i use

1162
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,040
them very well i do not carry all that

1163
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,560
crap with me

1164
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,240
that is just to like be real cool

1165
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,720
looking like oh look at what i could do

1166
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,800
well i could do all these no i don't use

1167
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,960
all those things i've used mostly every

1168
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,800
one of those at least one point on an

1169
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,440
engagement to prove a point

1170
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,280
but i don't use all of them at the same

1171
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,520
time and my favorite is the back pocket

1172
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,079
the back pocket is huge it's the whole

1173
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,280
length of it

1174
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,599
and i will tell you this for a fact that

1175
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,720
i know

1176
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,400
it can carry out a laptop

1177
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,200
without anybody noticing

1178
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,960
guaranteed verified

1179
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,200
so let's go to the next role the passive

1180
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,040
role it doesn't mean that i'm being

1181
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,960
wimpy or timid

1182
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,720
it's like the manners i'm using is like

1183
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,240
i'm here to help you

1184
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,480
help me help you

1185
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,880
it's like oh i'm just instead of saying

1186
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,720
i'm doing a usb audit

1187
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,440
i'm like oh i'm here doing a usb audit

1188
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,079
we're trying to make the network faster

1189
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,760
you tell someone you're trying to make

1190
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,599
the network faster

1191
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,119
carte blanche motherf it's done

1192
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,520
you ask a user it's like have you

1193
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,880
noticed a network running a little bit

1194
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,319
slow they could be on a t1 fiber line to

1195
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,800
their desktop and like yeah it has been

1196
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
running a little slow lately

1197
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,079
it's like i'm here to make that faster

1198
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,200
whoa

1199
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,480
you know

1200
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,720
what can we do for you what do you need

1201
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,880
i'm just just everything it's like so

1202
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,920
yes

1203
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,400
so you do that where you're trying to

1204
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,440
help them but you need some help too to

1205
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,920
do that and that's how you do the

1206
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,079
passive thing and the hardware is

1207
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,839
amazing because you can do way more

1208
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,839
techy stuff you get a lot more unusual

1209
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:48,800
things

1210
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,079
it's like this is the way i usually

1211
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:50,960
dress

1212
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,440
and yes i have worn the shirt that said

1213
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,280
hacker on it while i was robbing places

1214
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,160
before it's pretty hilarious it's like

1215
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,960
warning labels uh but yes this the black

1216
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,960
shirt says a hacker and the uh the other

1217
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,200
patch says your company's computer guy

1218
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,520
and yes that is a microsoft badge copied

1219
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,680
from the website from twitter where

1220
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,839
someone posted their new microsoft badge

1221
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,680
which i was very thankful for

1222
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,920
microsoft by the way has updated their

1223
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,800
badges which i appreciate the person who

1224
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,119
then tweeted that one out so i could

1225
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:25,839
update my badge and i have the newer one

1226
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,800
do i use the newer one no

1227
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,720
because who knows what a microsoft badge

1228
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,079
looks like

1229
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,920
and it's roughly the right one so that's

1230
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,440
what i do

1231
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,839
and now i have the

1232
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,359
clipboard yes

1233
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,359
it's the clipboard of doom

1234
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,920
don't judge me on 12. okay it's like the

1235
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,520
clipboard of doom

1236
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,040
is very cool

1237
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,440
because it has compartments

1238
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,200
like the two batch bunnies right there

1239
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,920
and i love the fact that yes i have used

1240
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,480
the bash money where it says victim on

1241
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,559
it

1242
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,839
it's like that was a little weird to

1243
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:01,599
explain but i figured i i was able to

1244
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:03,119
manage it

1245
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,720
here

1246
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,880
is the most scariest

1247
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,040
scariest

1248
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,000
device in my arsenal

1249
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,559
more people need to be afraid of this

1250
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,400
i'm not talking about the omg cables

1251
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,160
which are microcomputers that look like

1252
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,319
charging cables that can compromise a

1253
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,559
machine from five miles away i'm not

1254
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,440
talking about those

1255
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,920
the envelopes

1256
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,319
with a marker

1257
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,000
i walk into a secured area that i'm in i

1258
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,400
see an unattended desk i see an

1259
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,160
unattended office

1260
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,000
but they have their name badge on there

1261
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,599
they have their name tag

1262
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,040
they show me who's supposed to be

1263
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,319
sitting there

1264
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:46,240
so what do i do

1265
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,760
i take the marker i write their name

1266
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,599
on the envelope

1267
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,319
i put in a malicious usb drive

1268
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,319
in the envelope

1269
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,800
you know seal it up nice and tight

1270
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,119
and i leave it on their desk and i walk

1271
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,839
away

1272
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,839
who's not opening that

1273
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,880
you received an envelope in your secured

1274
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,480
area

1275
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,880
with your name on it

1276
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,440
with the usb drive

1277
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,480
who's not going to plug that in

1278
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,480
it's got to be legit

1279
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,160
it's never legit okay

1280
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,720
but also i have more

1281
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,880
i have my proxmart i can carry like my

1282
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,240
proxmart a wi-fi pineapple full size i

1283
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,720
got the land turtles uh but the favorite

1284
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
one right there is the one that says

1285
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,640
hacked that's my hdmi uh screen crab

1286
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,280
have you seen these

1287
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,280
what it does is you connect it to the

1288
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,119
hdmi cable going to the monitor

1289
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,800
and you know the executives have the

1290
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
good monitors they're not stuck with

1291
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,359
those vga crap things at the tellers or

1292
00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,760
or the other uh people in accounting are

1293
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,119
stuck with

1294
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,119
they got hdmi

1295
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,280
you know it's lucky if they can get dvi

1296
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,160
right

1297
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,119
your executive's got hdmi

1298
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,400
so you plug this device in

1299
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,520
and it will record everything it sees on

1300
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,160
the screen

1301
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,440
while still going through to the screen

1302
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,480
and

1303
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,400
why is there an antenna there jason

1304
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,960
because you can access it wirelessly

1305
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:33,280
you can record take screen crabs grabs

1306
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,920
it's like with that

1307
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,760
that should be frightening how many

1308
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,760
ids's and blinky boxes are picking that

1309
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,160
one up

1310
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,920
yeah exactly none it's like

1311
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,240
so let's go to the next one uh these are

1312
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,200
the omg rolls uh this should not be your

1313
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,559
first choice

1314
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,200
too many times it's my first choice okay

1315
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,280
this is when you're just like

1316
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,520
i don't know what i'm gonna just wing it

1317
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,920
you know i call it the yolo uh plan

1318
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,599
right you know yolo let's see what

1319
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,559
happens

1320
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,920
uh and so

1321
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,079
um i can't tell you what certain

1322
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,200
mannerisms are pretext also the hardware

1323
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,760
is totally different i've robbed a place

1324
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,880
um as a tv producer

1325
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,440
uh i've robbed uh and actually will show

1326
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,640
this picture

1327
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,000
uh my favorite is robbing hotels

1328
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
uh this was actually in the south of

1329
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
france i'm sure y'all recognized the

1330
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,960
area

1331
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,400
it's not the hotel i was i was robbing

1332
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,640
um

1333
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,440
the hotel that i was robbing

1334
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,839
was so high-end

1335
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,520
and expensive

1336
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,359
they could only afford to have me there

1337
00:51:43,359 --> 00:51:45,440
for one night

1338
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,079
then they put me in this cheap hotel

1339
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,640
for the rest of the engagement

1340
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,040
which i love the view and i've literally

1341
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,880
robbed them in those teenage mutant

1342
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,839
ninja turtle pajama bottoms barefoot

1343
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,559
and a t-shirt

1344
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,440
it's like i walked out drunk actually

1345
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,680
like i was like oh get some air it's

1346
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,400
like walk around

1347
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,280
go down go around the side find the

1348
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,000
kitchen entrance door unlocked and i

1349
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
start walking through the underground

1350
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,160
everybody knows that uh most hotels have

1351
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,079
underground sections right that's where

1352
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,000
all the work happens

1353
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,520
and that's where i go

1354
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,800
because that's where the server rooms

1355
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,559
are and the departments and the hr and

1356
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:27,599
the executives and stuff that are

1357
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:28,960
usually not the executives but they're

1358
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,040
like the people that are doing the work

1359
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,240
go then i was done

1360
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,079
and so while i was done i was like well

1361
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,119
i need to get out of here so i see

1362
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,359
a person in the uh

1363
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,680
the room service guy and i'm like

1364
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,599
eleanor

1365
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,079
hello there

1366
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,680
holland elevator

1367
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,200
i i'm not supposed to be here

1368
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:01,119
where it always helps if you look like

1369
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,640
you're upset with them because they're

1370
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,000
like what the what's going on it's like

1371
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,359
it's not my fault

1372
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,880
it's like and i'm like oh

1373
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,000
and it's like you know what he did

1374
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,119
he let me into the employee elevator

1375
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,200
push the first floor button you know

1376
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,400
where that elevator lets me out of

1377
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,240
the management office is behind the

1378
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,280
front desk i picked up hotel master keys

1379
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,440
and an unlocked workstation on my way

1380
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,559
out

1381
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,480
it was a five-star hotel they they gave

1382
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,559
you everything i loved it

1383
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:33,280
so

1384
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,280
that's how simple it can be

1385
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,880
but usually i do something like that

1386
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,800
it's like i just i'm not trying to

1387
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,640
exploit you i'm trying to educate you

1388
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,720
so most of my payloads come with like a

1389
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,880
payload of just notepad or i'm using

1390
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,640
these usb drives showing them like in a

1391
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,280
pin to show them that dangers come from

1392
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,520
all different shapes and sizes we got to

1393
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,160
stop thinking that this is how an attack

1394
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,559
is going to be

1395
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,359
because promise you i will get in

1396
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:02,480
okay

1397
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
and um and you got to remember if i do

1398
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,920
find a way in and i usually do you need

1399
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,200
to be worried about it right because

1400
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,119
this is two people these are two

1401
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,559
sections where someone told me i

1402
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,720
couldn't get up or i couldn't do

1403
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:15,680
something

1404
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,520
and the one on the left is nekozia

1405
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,760
cyprus i am seven stories above the

1406
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,400
building and to get up there without

1407
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,640
getting the camera to prove a point

1408
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,400
because i was actually being petty at

1409
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,480
this point it's like to prove the point

1410
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,280
to the guy that i was auditing that he

1411
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,200
told me i could not get

1412
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,920
to the server rooms that had a plaster

1413
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,200
wall behind a glass window on their roof

1414
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,520
without being detected by their cameras

1415
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,720
and i told them like well if you go out

1416
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,319
the elevator lobby right there at the

1417
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,200
corner and it's like and you climb over

1418
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,880
around that column even though it's

1419
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,920
seven stories up and get up to that vent

1420
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,559
you can climb up and get to it and you

1421
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,480
would not trip any cameras

1422
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,559
but that's not you can't do that and i'm

1423
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,240
like hold my jacket

1424
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,480
and then i did it and then i told him

1425
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,160
it's like there's a camera in my jacket

1426
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,079
will you take a picture for me and he

1427
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,559
was nice enough to do so um this one was

1428
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,680
telling me that it's like this was a

1429
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,119
secured building

1430
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,680
because they have an anti-climbing

1431
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,440
uh

1432
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,440
thing around their ladder it's for

1433
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,200
anti-climbing

1434
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,839
and yes that's me taking a pallet from a

1435
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:24,799
less than 10 feet away at a dumpster

1436
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,880
using it as a prop and then using the

1437
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,359
anti-climbing ladder as my ladder

1438
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,280
so you never know

1439
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,839
so what you need to do is then make sure

1440
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,720
your employees know how to respond once

1441
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,400
i'm there

1442
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,280
this was from january 2020

1443
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,000
the best engagement i have ever did

1444
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,680
this is me using a paper printed

1445
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,440
visitors badge

1446
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,200
that i literally copied from online it's

1447
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,640
like it's just a printout it's not even

1448
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,640
the real badge

1449
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,400
didn't matter

1450
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,240
i got stopped

1451
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,680
people did the right thing

1452
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,319
every section i went to

1453
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:08,640
i was uh caught

1454
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,079
because they because i was there the

1455
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,359
year before

1456
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,440
and they learned the lessons

1457
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,000
management took it seriously not the

1458
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,559
employees at first it requires

1459
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,119
management to take it seriously and then

1460
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,160
security to take it seriously to educate

1461
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,119
the users so they will take it seriously

1462
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,319
and so i loved it that is the best job

1463
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:31,760
i've ever done

1464
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,040
because i was stopped in every section

1465
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,640
so i don't know what time it is that's

1466
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,559
one of the problems so i don't know how

1467
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,720
much more time i have i probably don't i

1468
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,520
don't care um but um wait i said that

1469
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,559
part out loud i'm sorry um so um

1470
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,559
remember perceptions don't just warn

1471
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,240
your employees show them how these

1472
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,559
attacks occurred not in theory but show

1473
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:55,119
them real world examples

1474
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,599
show them how these things happen

1475
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,920
show them how easy it can be there's

1476
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:01,359
plenty of videos on youtube there are

1477
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:03,359
plenty news stories out there

1478
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:06,960
show them how this happens

1479
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,760
interact with employees when things

1480
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,359
aren't on fire

1481
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,000
when i worked in security and i was a

1482
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,760
supplement officer for uh law

1483
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,240
enforcement guess what

1484
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,040
i met everybody on their worst possible

1485
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,880
day

1486
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,280
something horrible happened and then i

1487
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,200
show up

1488
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,839
i show up something horrible happens to

1489
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:30,880
them

1490
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,640
it's always a bad day with me

1491
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,319
but when you're talking about your

1492
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,520
employees

1493
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,280
they can't just see you on the bad days

1494
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,599
you need to reach out to your employees

1495
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,359
show them when the newest apple update

1496
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,280
is show them when the newest android

1497
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,599
updates are shown when there's a new bad

1498
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,040
thing going through the through the

1499
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,200
internet that they have to watch out for

1500
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,280
send them those kind of emails walk

1501
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,960
around and talk to them try to get to

1502
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:59,520
know them so they now understand that

1503
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,000
you're not an enemy you're not someone

1504
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,079
trying to trip them up and make sure

1505
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,000
that that they're doing the right thing

1506
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,160
but you're someone there to help them

1507
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,799
keep the company secure

1508
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,200
you're not the police you're not the

1509
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,960
goodness like you're not those kind of

1510
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,240
people

1511
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,720
you're there to help them

1512
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,880
you are there to actually

1513
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,520
be there for them to be better defended

1514
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,520
now also we need to start educating and

1515
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,400
empowering and enforcing the rules

1516
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,440
what what educating means start teaching

1517
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,599
them on day one one of their job

1518
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:38,640
responsibilities is security

1519
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,280
how many of your employees know

1520
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,119
that if they click on a link they could

1521
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,839
be subject to termination

1522
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,760
how many people know that it's their

1523
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,079
responsibility to secure the equipment

1524
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,599
that they're given

1525
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,359
they know if they go to an inappropriate

1526
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,400
website

1527
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,359
they can be written up or fired

1528
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:59,040
but why don't we equate that the same

1529
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,880
thing with them doing something that's

1530
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,280
not secure

1531
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,200
we need to educate them to let them

1532
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,280
realize they are part of the security

1533
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,799
team that's part of their job

1534
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,880
responsibility if they want to continue

1535
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,799
to feed and clothe themselves or their

1536
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,559
loved ones they have to follow the rules

1537
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,559
and so then you empower them

1538
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,880
you give them a cell an extension number

1539
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,480
that they can call

1540
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,640
if they see someone suspicious like me

1541
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,920
usually it's like you give them an email

1542
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,960
address

1543
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,680
that they can send suspicious emails to

1544
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:34,480
and when they make a mistake

1545
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,760
and click a link

1546
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,440
you've got to make it sure where they

1547
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,680
feel comfortable enough being able to

1548
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,920
forward that to you and tell you what

1549
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,520
happened

1550
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,799
because that means your compromise lasts

1551
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:52,720
five minutes instead of five months

1552
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,520
if your employee is afraid of responding

1553
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,280
to you or admitting that they did

1554
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,799
something wrong

1555
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,040
that's when your company fails

1556
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,040
that's when your security fails

1557
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,480
but if they are comfortable letting you

1558
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,720
know that they made a mistake

1559
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,319
they do better

1560
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,520
oops

1561
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,839
one last one while you're out chasing oh

1562
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,760
days there's

1563
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,480
7 331 days that still haven't been

1564
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,520
patched

1565
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,160
ignore the low-hanging fruit start by

1566
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,240
picking up the fruit on the ground

1567
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,079

01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,640
things that they're actually facing

1578
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,000
the attacks that are actually going on

1579
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,400
and also i want to add one last thing

1580
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,119

1582
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:07,200
[Applause]

1583
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,440
but i also want to take a moment

1584
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,440
to talk about uh because just like the

1585
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:12,559
beginning

1586
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:14,880
just like the end we got to help one

1587
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,000
another

1588
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,680
i have a friend of mine who used to be

1589
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,359
in hong kong

1590
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:21,920
and they're an amazing hacker

1591
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,480
who literally almost lost their life

1592
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,799
to domestic abuse because they were not

1593
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:28,960
seen as a human

1594
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,559
and they are trying to rebuild their

1595
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,799
life they're trying to re-get together

1596
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,920
it's like and so that's the website

1597
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,960
for them to go and uh for you to donate

1598
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,520
because i've seen so many people donate

1599
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,079
money to get a hacker to defcon

1600
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,599
but this person is trying to rebuild

1601
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,760
their life from what happened to them

1602
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,200
