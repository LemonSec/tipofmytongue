12
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,380
jump for me across the border I'm i had

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,538
the honor this morning of moderating

14
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,540
this opening panel State of the Union

15
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,399
Europe at a crossroads as you'll see in

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,739
your agenda there is a question mark at

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,840
the end of that title as a journalist at

18
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,250
a quality newspaper I've been taught

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,510
that there if there's a question mark at

20
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,539
the end of the headline it's probably

21
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,550
not true however in this case the

22
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,950
question mark is a very powerful piece

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,809
of punctuation and to debate whether or

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,190
not it should be there or not and if so

25
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:55,440
what that means we have a very

26
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,539

in the European Parliament in Brussels

42
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:47,250
I'm I spent the whole of October looking

43
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,520
at ballot boxes in Greece Belarus and

44
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,830
Poland during three very different

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,410
elections all with clear winners one

46
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,090
never in doubt all three of those

47
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,520
elections touched on some of the issues

48
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,670
that we'll be discussing today mr.

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,070
tsipras mr. Lukashenko and mr. vishinsky

50
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,750
all pose very different issues for

51
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,699
Europe Greece of course needs no

52
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,130
introduction for years had have been a

53
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,440
byword for economic fragility perhaps in

54
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,940
the EU financial system in governance

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,310
and in the potential of further

56
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,380
integration but Greece is also of course

57
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,480
a major player in the migrant crisis

58
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,239
currently dominating the front pages of

59
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,649
newspapers all across Europe the crisis

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,870
that's seen more than half a million

61
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,690
people arrive in Europe already this

62
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,090
year and no sign of those numbers

63
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,560
decreasing in Belarus mr. Lukashenko of

64
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,020
course represents not just a question of

65
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,120
eastern expansion but also the crisis on

66
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,500
the e u--'s eastern border of a

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,510
resurgent Russia challenging the

68
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,430
security of neighboring states and a war

69
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,579
in Ukraine that the Belarusian president

70
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,080
used as a tool and finally in Poland at

71
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,420
critical election saw the landslide

72
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,340
victory for a party has had difficult

73
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,380
relations with the EU in the past and

74
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,410
has vowed to push back against EU

75
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,269
regulations on both climate change and

76
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,730
migration and for many represents a

77
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,030
rising sense of national interest in

78
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,310
this part of the world visa V the desire

79
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,500
to please Brussels it is indeed a heady

80
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,470
mix and one that we will talk about for

81
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,030
the next hour and 20 minutes or so um we

82
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,400
welcome all of your questions from the

83
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,049
audience there's a very clever app that

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,960
you can send me questions through the

85
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,820
app and also there's a poll on there too

86
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,890
please do engage with the technology if

87
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:28,370
it fails I'm sure we will rely on

88
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,880
microphones or not shouting you're going

89
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,800
to come to you first um journalists

90
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,620
analysts conferences such as these they

91
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,580
love the word crisis they love to talk

92
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,660
about things not going as well as Europe

93
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,800
facing challenges that perhaps it never

94
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,380
really thought it would ever have to

95
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,130
face and I mean Europe has been at the

96
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,859
crossroads so often in in the last

97
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,350
decade so I'm very much convinced that

98
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,310
also this time we will manage to deal

99
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:01,130
with it indeed it's a relatively unique

100
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:06,680
situation i mean the the refugee issue

101
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:09,230
over shadows everything we have more

102
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,400
people on the move global 60 million

103
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:16,039
people many of them come to europe again

104
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,340
many of them who come to Europe come to

105
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:23,210
Germany I think it poses a significant

106
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:25,400
challenge to us but I'm also deeply

107
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,229
convinced that we are able to deal with

108
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,919
this if we able to deal with it as

109
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:33,020
Germany but not on our own but my

110
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,090
overall sense is we can do it it's a

111
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,940
it's a task for a generation it's

112
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,919
nothing that we can solve in 69 or 12

113
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,900
months we have to be honest it will it

114
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,630
will take time for example to integrate

115
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,929
those who come to us in our labor

116
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:51,260
markets but I'm convinced we will manage

117
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:55,550
this task and I'm also convinced that it

118
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,740
will and my plea would be that even if

119
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,040
we have this refugee crisis now that we

120
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:04,220
do not forget what were what was on our

121
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,320
plate before that topic arrived I mean

122
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,420
climate change will not go away the

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,370
economic and monetary union that that

124
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:15,920
that even talked about will not go away

125
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:17,750
the total change of our economy and our

126
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,730
labor markets due to digital you see

127
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,830
makers in their decision-making process

128
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:26,930
but also media only focus on one topic

129
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,270
so let's deal with the refugee crisis we

130
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,310
can do this but not forgot at the same

131
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,320
time what else a problem here not just

132
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,490
in the scale of the challenges but the

133
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,740
how many

134
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,080
our and Europe does struggle to deal

135
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,759
with things simultaneously I mean is

136
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,500
that a bigger challenge than maybe the

137
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,870
scale of them individually well i think

138
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,639
that the priority of the media are

139
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,319
different from the priority of politics

140
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,330
it is clear that now that's a good time

141
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,780
I'm more aware about this and more brave

142
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,789
about this as very often politics is not

143
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,229
brave enough and they wear enough of the

144
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,060
fact that you cannot follow the media

145
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:01,130
but in general should be the media to

146
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,590
follow politics what do I mean I mean

147
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,199
that I agree what with what has been

148
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,169
said it is clear that there are many

149
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:12,009
issues at stake and not only migration

150
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:14,479
that is migration but there is a

151
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:17,300
governance of the eurozone which which

152
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,568
is a clearly float and that we should

153
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,720
address Dantley the question is the

154
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:27,319
golden thread is a much bigger and in my

155
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,750
view justifies more Europe as as your

156
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,319
can say I mean there is one word that we

157
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,750
never pronounced as word which is

158
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,599
demography and it is true for migration

159
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,099
and is true also for the fiscal policy

160
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:43,820
that we have to develop around the

161
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:46,430
eurozone we can divide our secrets not

162
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:50,180
so Democrats all these kind of species

163
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,949
are mushrooming in Europe but we cannot

164
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,219
divide our self about the issue of

165
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:57,710
demography neither within Europe know in

166
00:06:55,219 --> 00:07:00,349
our relations with a big country like

167
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,900
Africa and the issue of migration is

168
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:06,770
mainly linked to this not now it is a

169
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,840
great policy we Italians since the day

170
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,359
number one of the rental government we

171
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,119
have been saying what now is a common

172
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,770
knowledge it is not enough to have

173
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,500
common knowledge common wisdom now we

174
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:22,099
need to implement what has been agreed

175
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,039
because one thing is to arrive very late

176
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,110
not too late to a common wisdom which is

177
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,469
the agreement or migration and I think

178
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,780
is that is if it is take too much time

179
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:35,449
to implement it of course so Europe is

180
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,880
giving as very late but is giving us but

181
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,280
there is this issue around this we have

182
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,780
to organize our polish because

183
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,210
demography justified the value-added of

184
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,109
European you off more Europe otherwise

185
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:50,630
it is difficult sometimes to justify why

186
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:53,780
stronger European action or a a wider

187
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,520
european dimension I need it thank you

188
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,198
to Charles someone that sits in Brussels

189
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,330
it's in the parliament do you think

190
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,260
there is that common sense of needing to

191
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,930
do something or do you think the

192
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,490
Brussels is as divided as ever well as a

193
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,440
parliamentarian amounts are knock on

194
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,270
doors in my home constituency of the

195
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,520
United Kingdom there is a crisis and

196
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,159
there's also a crisis in terms of some

197
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,750
of the elite projects like the eurozone

198
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,130
which have clearly not been fully

199
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,590
thought through and I think there's a

200
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,960
loss of confidence at popular level a

201
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,060
sort of almost like a European demos now

202
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,159
in the political classes to sort these

203
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,050
problems out and we seem to be stumbling

204
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,240
from one crisis to the next you notice

205
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,310
it grexit now it's the migration its

206
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,110
defence of the external borders have

207
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,020
they been properly thought through and

208
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,390
so on and of course there's both a wider

209
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:41,539
Europe crisis going on in terms of

210
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,909
Russia Ukraine stability in the Balkans

211
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,860
an election of an increasingly

212
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,779
authoritarian government rises in as

213
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,330
much as that we face you know a

214
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,580
situation in the next 18 months or so in

215
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,459
which my country could leave the

216
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,250
Europeans and if we leave that will be a

217
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,449
very major destabilizing signal to the

218
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,760
whole project which could rapidly

219
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:06,950
unravel I mean already we see in Holland

220
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,689
a million a million signatures going to

221
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,410
the national parliament demanding a

222
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,600
referendum on the free trade agreement

223
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:16,579
with the Ukraine which is bizarre now if

224
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,100
we see a brexit there will be rapidly a

225
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,959
demand for a Holland exit as well and so

226
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,320
on so I think we can't just sort of

227
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,459
brush over this is just yet another

228
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,890
crisis in which the solution is more

229
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,890
Europe which is what we hear from mr.

230
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:33,110
Younker and others the demographic

231
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,069
problem Italy is very very acute I come

232
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,810
from a country where there is no

233
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,690
demographic but we have the problem of

234
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:42,020
our population expanding so rapidly it's

235
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,660
D it's predicted it will hit 70 million

236
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,670
people in the next 20 years from

237
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,060
currently 63 when I was a young man it

238
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,729
was 56 is now 63 hitting 70 largely

239
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:55,339
driven by immigration and where some of

240
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,600
the political classes particularly less

241
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,940
so in Eastern Europe because you don't

242
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,430
have the same experiences is this

243
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,960
concept now the social

244
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,969
he Jie has gone to the top of the

245
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,770
political agenda so the economic

246
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,649
arguments about demographics needing

247
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,110
more migration from are no longer having

248
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:13,600
the same pull factor with the ordinary

249
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,980
voter they may have had in the past when

250
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,190
the numbers are much smaller when you

251
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,040
have a situation in Britain where

252
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:22,779
600,000 people have settled you know one

253
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,029
percent of the population are settled in

254
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:27,010
the last year alone this is a very major

255
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:29,649
issue we can't just brush it aside and

256
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:32,050
we need to find reasonable solutions but

257
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,899
certainly you know I think my country

258
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:38,319
was right in predicting the risks of the

259
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:39,820
euro as a concept the single currency we

260
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,200
wish it well as a project now we want to

261
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,390
make it clear we don't want to be part

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,149
of it but we also were not part of the

263
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,010
asylum and immigration common policy

264
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,779
either because we also thought this

265
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,520
could cause problems in the future we

266
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:54,310
were very skeptical about Sheng and

267
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,560
working although very well-intentioned

268
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,510
all these projects were so I think there

269
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,880
is a really serious project now and I

270
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,380
think in Brussels in the parliament you

271
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,959
get a big split you get a split between

272
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:08,140
the right wing and the far left who are

273
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,060
very increasingly verily Euroskeptic

274
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,100
you've got Madame lepen standing up

275
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,750
saying she wants France to leave the

276
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,160
European Union she's running at

277
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,450
twenty-five percent in the polls you

278
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,860
know she may even get through the second

279
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:20,589
round of presidential election this has

280
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,750
never been witnessed in my lifetime in

281
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:25,060
as an MEP I've been around for 16 years

282
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,950
in the European Parliament and just a

283
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,020
sort of paper over the cracks and to say

284
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,670
more Europe is a solution we will

285
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,310
somehow weather the storm and it will be

286
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,890
okay there are still sunlit uplands up

287
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:40,060
there just over the horizon is an item

288
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:42,850
of faith I am very very concerned about

289
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,979
these challenges whole issue of Britain

290
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,720
leaving the European Union has to be one

291
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,880
of the biggest existential challenges to

292
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,709
the whole project we were the lots of

293
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,180
topics that I know that looks little but

294
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:53,979
even as come to you first is there an

295
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,390
issue here that Europe's sort of its

296
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,860
losing the trust of the citizens now

297
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,209
it's not just the politicians who are

298
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,620
bickering citizens are starting to

299
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:01,660
question the project is that it's that a

300
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:05,440
more fundamental issue here that puts

301
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:08,770
Europe at this crossroads you're

302
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,730
perfectly right it's a it's a year of

303
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,730
facing crisis

304
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:19,099
provoking yes disappointments rejections

305
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,960
not only your skepticism but also euro

306
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,720
phobia and it's a different story your

307
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,050
skepticism what you don't like that you

308
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:31,400
stay your phobia is you add Europe that

309
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:34,430
much that you go out it's true for Euro

310
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,709
membership Schengen and the pressure

311
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,140
today and of course the possible breaks

312
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:42,620
it I think it's not a love it or leave

313
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,140
it dilemma and I think for the citizens

314
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:48,590
you have mentioned there are very

315
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:52,010
contradictory reactions if I take one

316
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:55,130
example the euro area crisis there were

317
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:57,260
tensions around the dialectic more

318
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,270
solidarity from the European Union

319
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,939
because it was needed for not planned

320
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:05,300
but it was needed so bailout and in

321
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,550
compensation more control so Europe has

322
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,130
lost pakia but I could have maybe had

323
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:13,160
Germany or Finland it was too much

324
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,750
solidarity so for German citizens too

325
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,390
much solidarity but of course for Greek

326
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,810
people for Portuguese people it was too

327
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,580
much control too much austerity so your

328
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,400
skepticism to read types of your

329
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,410
skepticism but no yoru phobia because

330
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,920
the Greeks wanted to remain part of the

331
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:33,260
EU and the European Union the eurozone

332
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,839
the Schengen area as well so we will see

333
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,630
what will happen as regard the refugee

334
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,630
crisis and the Schengen area but it's

335
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,670
the same dialectic solidarity needed but

336
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,800
also more control needed it's not only a

337
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:48,199
crisis of solidarity it's also a crisis

338
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,140
of confidence and not only confidence

339
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:55,130
for the citizens but confidence between

340
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:59,120
the Member States but what I see today

341
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:01,820
is that the spinal cord of the European

342
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,160
or European integration has been put

343
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,910
under pressure yes euro and Schengen

344
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,760
it's a spinal cord but still it resists

345
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:13,689
so it's what I call euros scoliosis it's

346
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,610
not yours Claire roses you know euro

347
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,790
cool sclerosis was what when nothing

348
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,670
happened now a lot happens and of course

349
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:25,339
it's it's bit strange no solutions too

350
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,140
little too late but still it resists and

351
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:29,660
we have witnessed up until now it's

352
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,180
further progress of the European

353
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,459
integration and on on last point last

354
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:38,569
example i'm happy to say this in in

355
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:42,380
slovakia it has forced citizens and

356
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:44,900
member states to be aware of the fact

357
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:48,560
that being a member of a union means

358
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:51,860
rights and duties so for example what is

359
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,949
at stake today in a refugee crisis is of

360
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,620
course their duties and rights duties

361
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,120
it's also to control efficiently

362
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,440
external borders because it's our

363
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,320
borders but duties is also sharing

364
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,480
relocation mechanism part of the

365
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,610
Solidarity aspect and I think it's

366
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,410
evacuates 802 people 802 people so what

367
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,450
Slovakia will have to consider yeah

368
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,930
sometimes you don't like it and the

369
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:23,510
right to be part of a free movement area

370
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:27,109
and the Schengen area so that's what is

371
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:29,630
at stake today my last point is to say

372
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,210
in this first statement that what is

373
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:35,150
striking is that these crises have been

374
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,010
in what looking crisis in what looking

375
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,829
crisis I mean we are all looking at each

376
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,750
other we are not very confident visibly

377
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,240
each other between citizens between

378
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,640
member states we are focusing on

379
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,100
differences between physical coupe

380
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,810
countries and Germany or Greece and

381
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:57,070
Finland but at the same time there were

382
00:15:52,810 --> 00:16:01,550
external prices and what we need is more

383
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:05,570
outward looking dash and terrorism I

384
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:09,020
kind of change many many global

385
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:11,480
challenge visibly which you mention the

386
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,660
crossroad people have to know whether

387
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,400
the EU is a threat because on the

388
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,410
previous crises it was seen as a threat

389
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,770
with too much solidarity too much

390
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:24,290
control or on the contrary an answer to

391
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,329
these threats but for this shift to

392
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,640
happen and I think it's under way there

393
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:32,570
is a need to focus more on external

394
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:36,500
crisis within which a common answer is

395
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,870
needed and maybe then more United

396
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,290
actions than the division we have seen

397
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,480
in

398
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,389
for years more crisis is good do you

399
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,040
think Sanjay I know see you it's sort of

400
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:48,050
becoming piqued by a few comments in

401
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,269
Charles's opening statement I mean that

402
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,060
this idea of more Europe to tackle the

403
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:55,040
crisis it seems to allay viewer perhaps

404
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,779
that the crisis is exposing the gaps

405
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,980
between European countries how do you

406
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,199
how do you then think that they should

407
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,430
be pulled back together by more crisis I

408
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,859
mean could you so if Ella gate that a

409
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,720
bit what I mean of course the demography

410
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,370
is another British British exception

411
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,929
because the magraph in the rest of the

412
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:10,428
continent if the demography I was

413
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,079
talking about of course we have to

414
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,819
listen to the British demography and

415
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,139
exception but we have to think to the

416
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:19,059
future of the continent which of the

417
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:24,559
continents say that demography is on the

418
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:26,329
negative side and then by 2050 UN report

419
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,070
european commission report the enlarged

420
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:33,649
union which would be or 32 33 35 country

421
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,629
will need 40 million workers more that's

422
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,450
that's what we have to think about of

423
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:40,429
course I mean as a politician you would

424
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,280
never say this on in the daily debate

425
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:45,140
but at least we have to think this and

426
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,470
direct according to this because that

427
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:50,960
the reality we are facing the rest so

428
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,730
it's not an act of faith it is an act of

429
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,100
political pragmatism what we have paid

430
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,530
in this cell in the last year's it is

431
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,379
the non Europe in migration and the

432
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,210
xylem not the migrate migratory and

433
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,780
asylum common policy which we are non

434
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,250
existing we have paid the price of

435
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,320
pretending that we keep we could deal

436
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,559
with the phenomenon which is by its

437
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,168
nature transnational and that because of

438
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,530
crises around the world as if say is

439
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:20,750
increasing well if you think that you

440
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:23,510
can rule and govern a transnational

441
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,690
phenomenon with national or even worse

442
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,010
nationalistic policies you are fooling

443
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,960
yourselves and you're fooling your

444
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,290
people and it can work in the very short

445
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:35,750
term but it certainly won't pay back in

446
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:38,928
the medium term and that this is the

447
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:41,990
this is d haven for this dream is with

448
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:44,450
the a vamp of populism because what the

449
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,350
citizen to expect from us it concrete

450
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:50,570
answer to solve concrete problems and

451
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:53,158
the issue of migration it is a concrete

452
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,739
problems it affects social cohesion

453
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:58,139
it affect the budget it affect the lack

454
00:18:55,739 --> 00:19:01,409
of workers it has affected security I

455
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:04,408
don't we don't want and we hope we won't

456
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:07,019
pay the cost of slow Europe in

457
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:09,509
implementing this and of course being it

458
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:13,470
nerd transnational it is clear that it

459
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:17,609
has it must push us to look beyond our

460
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:20,700
body bottom and to look beyond our

461
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:23,070
common borders which are not by the way

462
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,409
ruled as common border another problem

463
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,109
in the problem and we have to look to

464
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:31,710
Turkey and we have to look to Syria and

465
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:35,879
we have to look to Libya I mean also a

466
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:38,909
and also Olivia I mean it has been many

467
00:19:35,879 --> 00:19:41,070
mistakes of the made on Lydia because

468
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:43,220
making a war without doing to do after

469
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,379
the war it has been a major mistakes and

470
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,929
now today we are paying another another

471
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:51,509
we have worth paying another cost and

472
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,950
those who saw that it was only in

473
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:54,720
Italian coast I've been fooled again

474
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,169
because it is clear that this issue

475
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,389
require a strong European European

476
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:03,059
action so I mean it is not a question I

477
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:06,478
don't like the rhetoric of Europe has

478
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:09,840
been always as always got stronger and

479
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:12,570
bigger and more convincing crisis

480
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,629
through crisis because I think that this

481
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:18,779
is come out a self-complacency and that

482
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:21,359
it done it doesn't work it doesn't work

483
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:24,749
today but it is clear that we have to be

484
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:28,379
very clear on how we manage the common

485
00:20:24,749 --> 00:20:32,340
issues and the fact that the UK is not

486
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:34,678
in Schengen as entered at all the issue

487
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,299
of Calais because you got the cali

488
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,119
crisis and you got the Christ at the

489
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:42,359
border between France and UK even if UK

490
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,939
is not in Schengen so I mean you see the

491
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,918
point also on this I want I want to be

492
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,220
very clear because also you invited us

493
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:52,649
to be very clear we say in Italy when

494
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,269
you have to make an hour choice that you

495
00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:56,478
are on a tawa and you have to choose

496
00:20:54,269 --> 00:21:00,659
what you want to throw out of the tower

497
00:20:56,479 --> 00:21:03,269
well for me I'm positive I want to throw

498
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,669
out the tower Dublin because it is

499
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,960
obsolete because it has proven effective

500
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:09,120
because the proof

501
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,669
inadequate it because it was concerned

502
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,279
it was conceived in another historical

503
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:16,559
era and I want to keep Schengen but not

504
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:19,169
because an act of faith but because

505
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,260
Schengen is freedom for Europeans this

506
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:24,990
is changa is the biggest gift that

507
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,210
Europe has given to Europeans and I

508
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,460
think that we shouldn't put a stake but

509
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:32,100
we should take the countermeasures

510
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,220
common border secure it in our border

511
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,449
more concrete and effective European

512
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,059
action with the country of origin

513
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,010
transit things we discussed in level

514
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:42,480
data and we will discuss after level

515
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,490
later but on which we have to be much

516
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,779
more effective this is the Dublin

517
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,549
agreement this is an advocacy for

518
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,799
getting rid of Ireland from them clear

519
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:51,510
said your guy I mean there is a separate

520
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:53,389
debate on migration but I do think we

521
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:57,929
should focus on it here as well I mean

522
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:59,640
Germany's position has been one of great

523
00:21:57,929 --> 00:22:01,020
interest to I think a lot of people in

524
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,539
Europe normally with these crises

525
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,220
Germany takes a really strong role it

526
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,779
leads the way a lot of smaller country

527
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,370
says well you know Germany is on it it's

528
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,770
fine we're gonna stand behind but we've

529
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:12,120
seen a certain amount of insecurity

530
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,639
within Germany itself as the migrant

531
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,100
crisis been almost a watershed crisis

532
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:25,350
for Germany in terms of the EU project

533
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:28,080
in its leadership yeah we we bet used to

534
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:32,389
the situation that what you just pointed

535
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,389
out that people like to know our views

536
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:38,879
this is a bit what I'm not so much in

537
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,240
favor of I mean we we need joint

538
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,159
European decision-making and solutions

539
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,100
what is different in the current

540
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:51,840
situation let's call the refugee crisis

541
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:54,029
openly is of course that compared to two

542
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,490
other crisis that we have seen in recent

543
00:22:54,029 --> 00:22:58,559
time may it be the one in Syria or the

544
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:02,490
one in Ukraine or even the crisis that

545
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:06,210
affected some euro area countries this

546
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:08,820
crisis is very tangible invisible to to

547
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:10,830
Jos X Factor to ordinary citizens yeah

548
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,220
the Greek debate was more or less

549
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:16,830
confined to politicians technocrats

550
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:18,400
bankers and media yeah you discussed

551
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:20,710
this in the center of Berlin

552
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,860
kind of spaceship in which we all live

553
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:26,020
and in which we are on our money the

554
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:29,080
refugee crisis is a different one it's

555
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:33,100
it's visible and tangible throughout the

556
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,939
country yeah we be received currently

557
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,350
around 10,000 people today yeah that

558
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,090
means every morning you need to provide

559
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,490
ten thousand additional breakfast so

560
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,260
it's not a question of money for us it's

561
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:47,320
simply a question how you deal with the

562
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:49,420
logistics given the sheer size of paper

563
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,370
that arrived yeah Chancellor Merkel has

564
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,270
spoken we expect this year roughly

565
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,469
around a million people to come and this

566
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,570
is more than one percent than our

567
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,430
population and these people are

568
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,520
distributed in the country you can see

569
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:05,950
them everywhere I mean my my parents

570
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,440
live in a small town in in the northwest

571
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,360
of Germany and there were certain times

572
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,670
it's close to the Danish border when den

573
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,610
market closed its borders there were

574
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:19,900
hundreds of people just living in this

575
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:21,399
tiny train station of that town yeah so

576
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:24,430
this makes it very different and

577
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,260
increases the pressure on politicians

578
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,560
when they go down to their their

579
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:33,580
constituency it brings a lot of more

580
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:38,800
heat in this debate but what I I

581
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:41,169
recognized in the country is that up to

582
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:45,370
now we see an unprecedented wave of

583
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:47,530
people willing to help yeah people

584
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:49,959
showing up in this kind of refugee camps

585
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:55,930
and provide their service brinklow this

586
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:58,900
bring food bring money whatsoever I have

587
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,210
never seen such a wave before but at the

588
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,760
same time one has to be honest there is

589
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:06,550
an attack on a refugee camp nearly every

590
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,850
night this is also part of the the

591
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:14,470
reality that we see in in my country so

592
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:16,899
it's a very it's a new situation but as

593
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:20,590
I said I think we can deal with this if

594
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,480
we manage to set the right course but we

595
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:25,300
are not able to deal with it on our own

596
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,700
sunrise rightly said effective border

597
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,669
control does not take place between

598
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,660
France and Germany this is not what is

599
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,940
needed yeah

600
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:38,620
we have European borders so our borders

601
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,850
are the borders of the EU Charles to

602
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,209
play devil's advocate surely the

603
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,219
migration crisis does put put put the

604
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,660
owners on more Europe on saying let's

605
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,130
break down these national barriers let's

606
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,200
have a much more concerted effort to

607
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:52,450
control borders as a whole let's let's

608
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,150
try to integrate strategy in terms of

609
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,280
rehousing people I mean even even surely

610
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:59,290
you see that argument I see the argument

611
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,389
I don't actually agree with it to be

612
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,100
honest because you know again I come

613
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:05,560
from a country which stayed out of the

614
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,020
common asylum and immigration problem we

615
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:11,200
believe that you know when you have a

616
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,610
situation where we have today the

617
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,830
problems the question I have to ask my

618
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,939
German colleague here is you've said

619
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:18,220
you've given the signal from your

620
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,180
government that Germany has an open-door

621
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,560
policy for virtually any Syrian

622
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,510
irrespective of who they are where they

623
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,070
come from within Syria or whether or not

624
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:28,390
they are genuinely Syria because you get

625
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,379
people claiming now to be Syrian who

626
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:33,310
aren't even Syrians because they've

627
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:35,110
ripped up their passports so the numbers

628
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:38,080
are unlimited that some 80 million

629
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:41,500
people living in conflict or zones which

630
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,330
might be classified in which the states

631
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,130
could be persecuting their citizens and

632
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,470
therefore they would fall under the 51

633
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,030
Geneva Convention we in Europe have

634
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,410
tried to maintain the kind of

635
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,750
international moral high ground by

636
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:54,790
maintaining this approach of saying that

637
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,770
all refugees can come across the whole

638
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:58,810
world including neighboring countries

639
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,430
who don't take them I mean how many how

640
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,929
many Syrians have been taken by the Gulf

641
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,580
Cooperation Council countries you know

642
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,230
they share a common language culture and

643
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,850
religion but they're taking virtually

644
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,950
none at all and yet they're all heading

645
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,010
towards Europe understandable we have a

646
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,440
very growing economies a demographic

647
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:16,330
shrinking problem we have a generous

648
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,860
social security system but the numbers

649
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,389
are unlimited you know 1 million this

650
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,860
year what happens if there's another

651
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,870
million or two next year and the

652
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,699
following year my worry is that this is

653
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,699
going to be a gift to the far right a

654
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,900
gift to uris skeptics or your refer bits

655
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,190
as you call them in Britain or you're a

656
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:32,080
skeptic if somebody wants to leave the

657
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,350
European Union by the way you call it a

658
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,179
phobic and I don't see an end to this

659
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,820
how you can easily manage it I'm afraid

660
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,640
under the existing arrangements that we

661
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:44,230
have with you know Schengen full

662
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,380
adherence and a liberal interpretation

663
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,620
to the 50

664
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,960
convention and you know conflict zones

665
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,659
all over the place and increasing

666
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,130
problems in Nigeria sub-saharan Africa

667
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,230
the Middle East and so on I mean people

668
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:59,210
are coming from Pakistan give it coming

669
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:01,790
from Nigeria they're coming from Eritrea

670
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,950
they're coming from Afghanistan even

671
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,170
though we have we lost you know

672
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,970
thousands of our soldiers trying to

673
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:10,310
reestablish peace and security in

674
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,950
Afghanistan I I think that unless we

675
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:14,840
show send a very strong signal that we

676
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,730
cannot have an open-door policy that

677
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,679
this is a global issue that needs to be

678
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:21,590
addressed at a global level Europe will

679
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,160
be under enormous pressure and I fear

680
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:27,139
for you know the rise of the far-right

681
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,510
victories for parties likely pens and

682
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,010
you know you know you have the Lego in

683
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:33,050
Italy you see some of the things they

684
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:35,660
stay in the European Parliament you have

685
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:38,000
the Swedish Democrats you know all sorts

686
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:39,920
of and you know you're a skeptics and

687
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,690
far-right is getting together and saying

688
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,570
enough is enough and we need to start to

689
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,880
have you know fortress national borders

690
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,500
not let alone the external border and I

691
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,180
worry for the consequences and I know

692
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,790
it's very well-intentioned the German

693
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:56,420
attitude the Chancellor's but you know

694
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:58,129
as as mr. or batten said you know from

695
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,780
next door Hungary you know we don't want

696
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:03,170
to be in per unit have a multi cultural

697
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,430
agenda imposed on us from Brussels you

698
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,590
know these are various delicate

699
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,480
sovereign issues to nation member states

700
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,189
I'm not sure whether you can impose

701
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,170
quotas on countries which I'm willing to

702
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,730
take them if they want to take them

703
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,200
that's fine but the other problem of

704
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:17,750
course is we you know how many of these

705
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,980
individuals are genuine refugees how

706
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,420
many of them are economic migrants that

707
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,400
question is not being fully addressed by

708
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,280
sure and sure the next panel will deal

709
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,440
with that Eve child's mentions just all

710
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,450
bad i mean it that's a good a good point

711
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,220
i mean it has euro skepticism your

712
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,630
phobia become sort of the norm now this

713
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,890
is sort of what we europe will have to

714
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,300
deal with you know we have leaders

715
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,800
standing up and saying these things in

716
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,810
the european parliament openly

717
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,220
criticizing that the way things work is

718
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,570
that is that a shift that maybe the EU

719
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:44,600
didn't think would happen ten years ago

720
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:46,669
it sort of these people here to stay yes

721
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,969
of course your skepticism is growing

722
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:53,960
your phobia which i distinguish is

723
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:55,700
growing as well they are not that

724
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,750
powerful if you look at the european

725
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,680
parliament of course they are more

726
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,830
powerful than before

727
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:04,470
powerful at the European Council as well

728
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:06,689
the problem is the pressure they put on

729
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,640
mainstream parties yes and in this of

730
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,180
course they have an influence sometimes

731
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,600
it's true in in the UK they can set the

732
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:18,360
agenda Mr Farage had hardly ever one

733
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,639
seat in the house of common not only one

734
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,530
but he has set the agenda so of course

735
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,170
they have an influence it's partly

736
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,870
linked to the European crisis but I want

737
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:29,730
to stress that it's also linked to

738
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:33,239
domestic problems and you have mentioned

739
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:36,750
marriage no been twice I'm sorry to say

740
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,090
that marine lepen progression is mainly

741
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,880
due to domestic reasons in the wave

742
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:44,760
fronts has been badly managed for years

743
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,390
and years and front is facing a social

744
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,990
crisis an identity crisis as well as

745
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:54,960
political crisis so my lapels product of

746
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:57,960
this and it's not the product mainly of

747
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,810
your phobia in France even if it's part

748
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,760
of it for doctrine of course so I've

749
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:06,600
mentioned the identity crisis and to

750
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,400
answer your question is it to last I

751
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,919
mean these your skepticism or your

752
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,810
phobia it's it will all depend on the

753
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:16,410
elites reaction the mainstream parties

754
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:18,510
reaction and I will take it the example

755
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:21,360
of the refugee crisis of course this

756
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:25,080
creates tensions especially in countries

757
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,659
in an economic and social crisis but not

758
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,520
only because it's also an identity

759
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:32,430
challenge and in this I I share your

760
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,879
view it's an identity challenge but the

761
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:37,830
key factor is the position of the elites

762
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,620
and I will take the example of mrs.

763
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:43,679
Merkel what'd she say she said of course

764
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:46,310
it's a huge challenge to you challenge

765
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:50,700
as as important as a reunification one

766
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:53,610
but we are strong we are Germany it's

767
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,230
our duty to welcome the refugees the

768
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,479
refugees are not threats they are

769
00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:00,000
victims and I think this is a crossroad

770
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,810
as well whether you consider the victims

771
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,210
of threats of course she never said we

772
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,850
will welcome all economic immigrants

773
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,710
from abroad and she she said very

774
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,010
clearly we need to welcome refugees but

775
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,050
a fee

776
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:16,290
the key question for the elite and the

777
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:19,340
for mentoring part is this one are we

778
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:22,470
threaten and again I come back to

779
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:26,220
Slovakia are we threaten our with retina

780
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:30,270
Slovaks by 800 two people coming from

781
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,490
Syria 802 this is key and if the elites

782
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:36,570
and if the Prime Minister Mr fit so is

783
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:40,650
is thinking that yes slovakia is

784
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:43,950
threatened by 802 people coming from

785
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,270
Syria it's a problem yes of course and

786
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:51,180
if it's the case if the mainstream

787
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:54,060
parties go on goes on adopting the

788
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,340
vision of the world of the Year skeptics

789
00:32:54,060 --> 00:33:00,929
and Europe oh yes of course it can last

790
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:03,120
if again my last point on this if they

791
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:06,480
look at the world a bit more what they

792
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,040
will see is that Europe is shrinking we

793
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,610
are seven percent of the world

794
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:15,330
population soon six percent and I come

795
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:18,360
to the Sun rose point on demography we

796
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:22,110
are united in diversity at the moment we

797
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:24,479
are united in perplexity but may

798
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:28,379
shouldn't we be more United in adversity

799
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,540
in this word well again is to put in

800
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,980
that Ash the instability of our

801
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,790
neighborhood which is unprecedented

802
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:39,510
there was everywhere around us not to

803
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:43,500
mention China breaks climate change all

804
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:48,270
these challenges are our leaders able to

805
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,850
produce a narrative not saying there is

806
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:53,370
no problem between us of course there

807
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:56,429
are problems our differences are clashes

808
00:33:53,370 --> 00:34:02,189
but the main agenda for Europeans now

809
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:04,950
that they are united again is to look at

810
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:07,800
the world and to see if facing this

811
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:10,199
common challenge more common solutions

812
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,320
are needed I've my answer is yes should

813
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,908
I mean the main answers to be given up

814
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,200
from politician you're going to

815
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,370
opportunity respond to Charles but also

816
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,379
in your L so if you could touch on that

817
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:21,870
point I mean how the leaders mainstream

818
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:23,969
parties people like mrs. Merkel but but

819
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,638
others use these crises to their

820
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,959
advantage

821
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,129
to sort of continue to advance the

822
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,889
European project rather than admit

823
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:36,308
defeat yes that I I think I I want to

824
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:39,369
clarify a bit what is our stance on the

825
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:43,149
issue I mean first and this is totally

826
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:46,139
out of any question we will defend the

827
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:49,239
free movement of people inside the EU

828
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:52,839
this is one of the greatest achievements

829
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:57,779
that we have in this continent yeah that

830
00:34:52,839 --> 00:35:00,788
you can freely move work and study

831
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:03,130
whatsoever and that if you come from

832
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:05,049
France or from Sweden to Germany if you

833
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,329
come from Poland or Slovakia that you

834
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:10,059
are not considered as a foreigner but as

835
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:12,670
an EU citizens this is a thing that we

836
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:15,430
will always defend this German

837
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:18,609
government then when it comes to people

838
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:21,578
from so-called third countries non EU

839
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:25,990
member states this is also relatively

840
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:29,500
clear our legal provisions all say they

841
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:31,990
can come given the needs of our labor

842
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,000
market and then it trickles down to all

843
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,609
the instruments you know the EU blue

844
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,759
card or whatsoever but this is driven by

845
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:43,480
the need from our labor market and then

846
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:47,680
there is one exception this is the right

847
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,650
for political asylum yeah this is laid

848
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,680
down in our Constitution given our

849
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:56,529
history so if there's a war in your

850
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,019
country if you're personally prosecuted

851
00:35:56,529 --> 00:36:01,269
due to your religious belief to your

852
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:04,000
gender whatsoever you can claim

853
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:07,868
political asylum in Germany it's a

854
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,859
constitutional right that we have and

855
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:15,460
this is currently happening and in the

856
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:19,029
Constitution there is no limit so that

857
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:24,279
this is why the Chancellor acted as she

858
00:36:19,029 --> 00:36:27,430
did so we welcome these people if they

859
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:30,789
are political asylum seekers there is a

860
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:32,910
different group that often let's say

861
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:36,600
comes from the Western Balkan countries

862
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:39,330
they come for economic reasons I can

863
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,089
understand this if you are 25 and live

864
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,960
in Kosovo or in Macedonia that you say I

865
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,370
have a better perspective somewhere else

866
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,220
but you're not in a position to claim

867
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,859
political asylum so we must be honest to

868
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:55,879
this kind of people we understand your

869
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,470
reasoning but not all of you can stay

870
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,020
yeah we have improved the Libra labor

871
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,310
migration from the Western Balkans but

872
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:07,350
this is not a question of political

873
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:12,450
asylum what political leaders need to do

874
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:15,480
now is to support action I think on

875
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:18,149
three different layers the first one is

876
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,680
the domestic one and here we have to

877
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,650
distinguish between short-term and

878
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:26,069
medium-term in the short term we must

879
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:29,490
simply make sure that we have you main

880
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,200
conditions for those who come given that

881
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,029
the winter is instant front of us

882
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,089
meaning bringing the people out of tens

883
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:38,790
provides good schools food medical

884
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:42,210
treatment whatsoever the longer term

885
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:44,070
issue is more complex to integrate

886
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,980
people into the labor market because

887
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:49,110
this only will be a success story for

888
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,110
those who come as well as for the aging

889
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:54,420
societies that accept them if we manage

890
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:56,880
to integrate these people into the labor

891
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,150
market and this has first to do with

892
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,940
learning the language second with

893
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:07,890
professional training and qualification

894
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:10,470
and third integration is not voluntary

895
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:13,529
you also have to accept the values of a

896
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,259
democratic society meaning that man and

897
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:18,090
women have the same rights that

898
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,610
religious or sexual orientations are

899
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:23,000
part of your private life this has to be

900
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:25,620
accepted so this is the domestic level

901
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,160
the second level on which we need to act

902
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:32,430
is the European one yeah we have been

903
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:35,250
talking about a common European asylum

904
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,440
policy it's very much about effective

905
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:40,680
border control at the borders of the EU

906
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,990
these are our common borders and it's

907
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,750
also about a fair distribution or call

908
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,680
it reallocation of refugees that is also

909
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,430
part of it

910
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,529
and the third part is the European and

911
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,480
the international level that is we have

912
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:59,640
to deal with the root causes why do

913
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:03,480
these people move yeah and one key point

914
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,879
here is to end the war in Syria we all

915
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,330
know this will not take place in 69 or

916
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:13,590
12 months but let's put all european and

917
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:16,319
international efforts behind these

918
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:18,510
efforts to stop the reason why people

919
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,550
have to leave their countries so this is

920
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:23,010
what i think is is up to the political

921
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:25,140
leaders to act at the domestic level the

922
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,940
European level and the international

923
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,529
level I'm keen to move a little bit off

924
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,730
the migrant topic so we don't have

925
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,280
nothing to talk about later the day

926
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:36,030
Sandra bit to segue I mean the migration

927
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,400
crisis sort of if you like exposed the

928
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,960
fault lines perhaps between Western

929
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,910
Europe and the French and German

930
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,050
consensus if you like an and cellphone

931
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:44,549
Eastern Europe this part of the world

932
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:47,190
there was there was a lot of rhetoric

933
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:49,650
there was in the end Vito attempts I

934
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,720
mean is there a risk that too fast

935
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:54,180
integration too much Europe risks

936
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,580
forcing that divide wider and and and

937
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,720
Brussels losing centrally senior we

938
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,910
already see some of the rhetoric coming

939
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,250
out of leaders such as mr. Orban mister

940
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,540
fitzer mr. krichinsky I mean how do we

941
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:04,590
make sure that these countries come

942
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,040
along with us and surely it's their

943
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:12,380
right to determine how fast or slow

944
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:16,440
integration goes difficult question well

945
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:18,540
kill it by using but I want to be I try

946
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,700
to be as clear as possible as Frank as

947
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:25,650
possible if said one thing that is in my

948
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,540
view at the art of the debate and the

949
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:31,350
art of the problem which is mutual trust

950
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:33,480
and I think that the our continent our

951
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:36,360
union has lost mutual trust we don't

952
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,870
trust each other I don't believe that

953
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:42,180
this is that you it has been caused

954
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:45,540
initially by the migratory crisis I

955
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:48,240
think that initially has been caused by

956
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:52,140
the way we handled or we didn't handle

957
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,779
the euro crisis because we have turned

958
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:59,460
our relations into a creditor and debtor

959
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:00,570
relations and that is that is the awful

960
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,220
for them

961
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,340
to our trust and offer for what we want

962
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:08,160
to build up together and we should draw

963
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:11,040
a lesson all from that but the reality

964
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:16,350
that we have lost we have lost Muto

965
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:18,630
trust the other that we we do not have

966
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:20,339
on one side on one hand we have lost

967
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:24,540
mutual trust on the other end probably

968
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:28,230
we haven't been very effective in in

969
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:32,550
forging a sort of common political

970
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:34,170
culture about the Union and from this

971
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,540
point of view another war which has been

972
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,460
mentioned by basically all the cop

973
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,480
analyst has been a solidarity and

974
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:44,730
cohesion to me it is very clear as

975
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:49,800
solidarity is not in one way street

976
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:54,120
board it doesn't work only when as a net

977
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:57,240
contributor italy i have to give 2018

978
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,759
the 20 billion euro purpurea to the you

979
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,399
budget and I get back little bit more

980
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,010
than 10 10 billion yuan and I hid under

981
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,580
standard for other countries that kind

982
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:12,150
of Third Reich is very good yes that's a

983
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:14,549
that the arithmetic no madam at and then

984
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:17,070
you forget that the Solidarity is a

985
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:19,500
pillar on the treaty that we have

986
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:21,450
negotiated that we have adopted we have

987
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,250
ratified in our Parliament we have

988
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:27,000
ratified referendum also in other

989
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:28,830
policies you are mentioning you are

990
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,310
mentioning we are talking about

991
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:34,560
migration but can be also on civil

992
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:37,590
protection can be on social cohesion can

993
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,799
be convenient another another owner on

994
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:42,960
financial stability I mean all these all

995
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,100
these situations requires three died and

996
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:52,470
I do believe that that has been a major

997
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:55,799
problem in a day I hope not permanently

998
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:59,959
hope not strengthening west and central

999
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,820
Eastern Europe divided but in my view

1000
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,390
some of our friend from surgery a mr.

1001
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:07,980
Europe have lost a big bouquet shin a

1002
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:12,120
velocity big occasion because in terms

1003
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,540
of quantity what was required was very

1004
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,250
low

1005
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:18,250
term of political gesture would have

1006
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:23,980
meant a lot the others the other issue

1007
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:27,450
is it is perfectly useless that we

1008
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:30,820
negotiate treaty by treaty and we spent

1009
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:33,970
we spend hours and hours negotiation

1010
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:37,660
saying that as I know immigration policy

1011
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:42,970
must shift from unanimity to qualify

1012
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:49,980
majority voting we have been negotiating

1013
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:52,990
that we have been very pushy or to

1014
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,840
foresee that under lisbon treaty asylum

1015
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:59,430
and migration could be decided by

1016
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,430
majority it is not

1017
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,960
you
