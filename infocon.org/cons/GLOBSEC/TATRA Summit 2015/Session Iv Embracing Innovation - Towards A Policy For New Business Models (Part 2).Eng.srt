1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
t that you will make mistakes you will

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:09,629
correct them on the move you can't just

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,679
you know making the old preparations for

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,320
for the ultimate the agency without

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:19,859
making some mistakes even in the

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,990
evaluation you make mistakes but you

7
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,340
will just diminish the size of off

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:31,979
projects that are just submitted without

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:35,670
any chances of success and your work on

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,040
a principle which is the main principle

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,140
of for instance agencies I used to work

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,910
for it's not the agency is part of

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,559
integral part of the ministry of

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,538
economic and this is risk-taking we

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,620
never supported hundred percent any

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,079
project yeah we'll give eighty-five

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,899
percent to incubators if you want I will

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,340
elaborate on that and we will give in

19
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:05,309
some cases 30 40 on up to fifty percent

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:09,799
participation for ordinary a proposals

21
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,720
not more than sit so if somebody else is

22
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,630
winning and have the money to put on the

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,369
table for 50 up to fifty percent of of

24
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,830
the cost governor will assist in another

25
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:25,770
fifty percent this is the main principle

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,929
that we adopt was a main policy by the

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,090
office of this office of the chief

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,909
scientist we mentioned the crucial point

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,979
about evaluating the project or

30
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:40,110
evaluating those subjects that would be

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,280
eligible for for support how did you in

32
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,929
the office of the chief scientist

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,240
evaluate projects did you work together

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,159
with the private sphere or was it just

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,199
the officials of the chief scientist who

36
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,640
were responsible for evaluating the

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,220
project all first of all I have to

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,159
correct you we don't have any subject

39
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,369
that is preferable compared to other

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,180
because I think that government doesn't

41
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:06,149
have any any ability to predict what's

42
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,759
good and what's bad but if we want to

43
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,090
push forward some of the subject for

44
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,149
instance a bio sector which

45
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:18,110
its own characteristics then we will

46
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:22,459
provide fifty percent support regardless

47
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:26,890
of other circumstances which should be a

48
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,890
allowed only forty or thirty percent and

49
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:34,519
what I can elaborate little bit about

50
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,910
the policy that we are adapting so first

51
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:39,530
of all we are working according to a

52
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:42,980
allow specific law which is called the

53
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:47,750
encouragement of industrial rd and we

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:51,048
have to take considerably it's the

55
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:54,459
importance of industrial rd we are not

56
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:57,349
involved in basic research it is

57
00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:00,680
responsibility of the government to do

58
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:03,619
that and it is done quite well but we

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:09,310
are not involved in it although this is

60
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:13,160
the case industry can use the ability of

61
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:16,959
the university's via subcontracting them

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:21,650
no problem with it so first of all we

63
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:26,109
support only in duster R&D secondly it

64
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:29,420
is not intended for internal use only I

65
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:31,430
mean it's written in the center of the

66
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,980
of the law to improve the balance of

67
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,380
payment of Israel namely export and is

68
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,078
similar to what is going on here I mean

69
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,859
the local market is too small you have

70
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:46,130
to support products processes that can

71
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:51,220
be applied abroad otherwise you are

72
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:55,400
losing the ground and another issue is a

73
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,410
having employment within the country so

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,970
we will not support any project that

75
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:04,730
will materialize elsewhere unless there

76
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:08,569
are special circumstances that prevent

77
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:11,569
local production so we put emphasis on

78
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:15,168
local production because of employment

79
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:18,409
the factors etc you see the similarity

80
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:20,450
is obvious between slovakia in israel in

81
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,190
these aspects if you want to decrease

82
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,659
the unemployment rate which is i don't

83
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,910
know right now

84
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,490
eleven percent ten percent and you want

85
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:34,070
to decrease it to five percent this is a

86
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:37,310
basic requirement from your perspective

87
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:42,560
and you can apply it if you are not

88
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:44,840
happy with Jessie Israeli x.x we popular

89
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,150
etcetera etcetera and you can learn from

90
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,049
mistakes that happened there it happened

91
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:56,080
with us and I think that the beginning

92
00:04:51,050 --> 00:05:00,890
of yo your ability to set up an agency

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:06,469
which is transparent not corrupt we set

94
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:09,260
it 25 30 years ago because you have the

95
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:14,410
learning curve of our experience and you

96
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:18,380
can just benefit from it Thank You Adam

97
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,540
we assess to here in Slovakia that there

98
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,210
is enough money there is enough capital

99
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,000
for startup projects that already have a

100
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,849
prototype ready there are in a later

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,820
stage of development however we have

102
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,640
problems with financing very risky that

103
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Valley faced startup projects with with

104
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,729
business angel money I know you are

105
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,469
coming from a private equity corporate

106
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:46,660
however what are your experiences with

107
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,070
business angel investments and are these

108
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:54,130
investments important in long-term

109
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:57,080
perspective for companies such as yours

110
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,600
so I think we touched on a number of

111
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,510
interesting things here about the size

112
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:06,320
of Slovakia about the limitations of

113
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:08,480
market expansion in the open digital

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,969
marketplace on mode investing in

115
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,740
businesses that are looking to sell to

116
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,480
the global market not just the domestic

117
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,280
market and I think you put all those

118
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,750
pieces together and you get an

119
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:23,619
interesting picture on you know building

120
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,330
brand Slovakia internationally not just

121
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,230
European but internationally so what

122
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:34,248
does that mean so leveraging the assets

123
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,959
of the country and turning them

124
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:38,749
into into marketing tools so whether

125
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:44,649
it's successful startups you already

126
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:46,759
have whether it's your successful

127
00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:48,349
international community of Slovaks that

128
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,259
have moved and are working abroad in the

129
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:55,128
US and Canada the rest of Europe Asia

130
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:57,859
and and turning them into into

131
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:01,189
emissaries right to build relationships

132
00:06:57,859 --> 00:07:04,429
with foreign sources of capital because

133
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:07,009
we you know capitals not domestic right

134
00:07:04,429 --> 00:07:09,078
there's a global capitals global I mean

135
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,489
any of our any of our funds if you look

136
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,619
at who is investing in them it's there

137
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:14,539
they're all global or North America fund

138
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:16,189
or our European fund their global the

139
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,558
people who own those funds are global

140
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:20,539
this is really no such thing as a you

141
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:22,279
know a US private equity firm or a

142
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:24,199
European private equity firm because the

143
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,360
people actually investing in those funds

144
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:29,089
are global they're all over the world so

145
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,569
I think it's about using its building

146
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:34,369
sort of international presence lean and

147
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:37,669
efficient to not don't need to spend a

148
00:07:34,369 --> 00:07:40,669
ton of money on it but you know in

149
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:42,859
Silicon Valley in in areas where there's

150
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,889
a lot of activity of like-minded startup

151
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,349
activity you know get some boots on the

152
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,909
ground people who are already there

153
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:50,959
right you don't need to send a bunch of

154
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:52,308
people there but people already there

155
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:57,369
use them to leverage make introductions

156
00:07:52,309 --> 00:08:00,799
to you know mid late stage investors and

157
00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:03,799
and use that and then second leave to

158
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:05,568
your point on you know I think you

159
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:07,008
mentioned scalability as well right how

160
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:08,509
do we get early startups who have

161
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:10,789
something ready to go how do you get

162
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,429
that as a challenge that many startups

163
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:14,899
have so at least I can speak because

164
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:16,638
because my role is actually kind of a

165
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,889
nun and operating executive so I work

166
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,689
with companies we invest in to improve

167
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,839
their business operations and grow the

168
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:26,419
businesses right so in that respect if

169
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,949
you take that and generalize it there

170
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,799
there's the financing of the early

171
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:33,318
business and get the you know the the

172
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:35,718
startup leaders off the feet and get the

173
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:38,990
proof of concept proven but then there's

174
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,159
there's a wider business expertise that

175
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,558
needs to be brought to it if you look at

176
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,449
like google ventures or something they

177
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:46,560
have a team of operational experts who

178
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:48,839
can help people with supply chain

179
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,310
with financial controls and processes

180
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,110
with you know getting financial

181
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,910
statements in place and being compliant

182
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,130
to health and safety regulations all

183
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,360
these things Microsoft the same right

184
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,890
the you've got a support for the for

185
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,140
these companies that you would invest in

186
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,580
right and we do that ourselves so we

187
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,290
invest in a company is a country you can

188
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,240
do that to you can you can have that

189
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,040
could be a network of experts you don't

190
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,620
have to hire a staff of people to do

191
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,660
this right but it's a you know

192
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,400
matchmaking I guess at the end of the

193
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,370
day is what I'm saying can be a key

194
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,560
function right and you know in in

195
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,170
California in certain places in the

196
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,000
world there's enough critical mass that

197
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,680
nobody fostered Silicon Valley there is

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
no government program to develop it it

199
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,189
just happened right because you got

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,750
critical mass because it was sunny all

201
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,790
the time and people like to be in the

202
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,520
sunshine so they ended up being there

203
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,920
and obviously having Stanford and some

204
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,720
key universities there's you you build

205
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,130
off your critical mass now if you don't

206
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,870
have critical mass which I think we're

207
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,250
saying maybe we don't yet that you can

208
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,250
foster that with some efficient

209
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,570
matchmaking the same as relationship

210
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,520
matching tools on the internet right

211
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,040
don't have critical mass to get a date

212
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,610
then you you use an app to find you know

213
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,900
so I think there's a certain sort of

214
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,550
fostering those sort of introductions

215
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,079
that can be done through the

216
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,510
International slow actually there was a

217
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,200
questionnaire that was yeah can I

218
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,150
reactor of course I think a lot of very

219
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,550
very good points have been made and I

220
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,750
think really you have to keep it the

221
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,140
experience from other countries

222
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,780
successful countries shows one any such

223
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,100
policy because of its macroeconomic

224
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:25,250
dimensions one and because it touches on

225
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,770
so many things like even education zone

226
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,470
it has to be led by and to keep it

227
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,810
simple I think that is ultimately what

228
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,360
it's all about them that's how I mean we

229
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:39,209
have a long experience of support

230
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,580
programs you know we went all the way up

231
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:44,010
to framework programme seven our horizon

232
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,640
2020 to the eighth of these programs and

233
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:51,330
the simplicity element is the essential

234
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:53,610
feature for for starters I mean that is

235
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,620
really something to focus on third I

236
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,860
think the issue of scale is really

237
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,830
really which is in center

238
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,450
you're busy it's a bonus but you okay

239
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,770
you also have the size of the country

240
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,410
and the state of economic development

241
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:08,170
that you have and so you need to the

242
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,300
scaling apps with some of the countries

243
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,430
around you i think and i know you're

244
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,140
working on that so i think that is is

245
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:18,609
really something something very

246
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:21,699
important and then foot I okay we've got

247
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:25,300
this scheme to allow member states to

248
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,310
learn from the positive and less

249
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,880
positive experience of others I mean

250
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,800
Slovakia is the first member state to to

251
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,680
have applied for this new scheme and

252
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,870
we're really happy to too soon to be

253
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,109
able to offer that Ian level there are

254
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:46,000
all these instruments support mechanisms

255
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,140
a lot of money which exists at European

256
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,080
level so you have to find the

257
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,730
complementarity with that I think you're

258
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,990
you're talking about the stage is where

259
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:58,540
you could to get to be successful in

260
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,880
getting European funds because that of

261
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:03,219
course offers the the international

262
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,020
platform and as you said the world is

263
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:07,300
global so we're talking here about

264
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:09,910
companies which we have to be able to

265
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,969
compete not just on the Slovak mark not

266
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,680
just within that digital singh within

267
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:18,010
this physical single mark and the

268
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,140
digital single market I the European

269
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,270
Union but also beyond this global

270
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,910
competition actually there was a

271
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,270
questionnaire for for the audience and

272
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,290
they were asked to to to vote on the

273
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,120
question what is the role the government

274
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,860
in fostering innovation and motivating

275
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,430
for entrepreneurial activities and

276
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,410
actually the the answer that has the

277
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:40,209
most votes is just leave the private

278
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,500
entities doing their own business with

279
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,380
less regulation and involvement

280
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:47,470
innovation and R&D activities Tony you

281
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:50,430
are coming from a regulative or

282
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,430
regulation buddy

283
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,959
ya think it's very important that that's

284
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:57,579
the interesting thing in the director

285
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,399
channel in which I work which is

286
00:12:57,579 --> 00:13:03,699
responsible for the digital economy we

287
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,350
both have yes we have regulatory powers

288
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,779
in the air its fears where we need to

289
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,970
regulate but only when we need to

290
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:12,240
regulate we're talking about copyright

291
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,819
when you're talking about the telecoms

292
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,620
framework when you talk now about these

293
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,930
practices which I explained earlier on

294
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:23,499
like geo-blocking okay there we have to

295
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:25,180
regulate but it's it's it's a regulating

296
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:27,490
at European level is often also a

297
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,489
measure of left national or a lot of

298
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:34,629
national regulation I eat 28 times

299
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:37,029
something x 1 x by x one piece of

300
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:41,379
regulation but we also i mean we also

301
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:46,199
support we have we manage 1.2 billion

302
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:50,319
per year research program out of which

303
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:52,748
you know next year 60 60 million euros

304
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:58,269
will be dedicated to particularly to the

305
00:13:52,749 --> 00:14:00,550
22 financing true SMEs in the various

306
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:03,670
development stages covering all the

307
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:07,628
stages so so it's not just that we

308
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:11,709
regulate we have a lot of 28 member

309
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:14,319
states as you know with the crisis the

310
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:19,779
economic governance mechanisms in europe

311
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:21,550
happen strongly have been strengthened

312
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:26,019
and developed and is called the European

313
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:27,670
semester where by member states together

314
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,980
with the European we're talking about

315
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,319
now and initiatives which you are

316
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,449
thinking about our part of this is the

317
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:36,550
structural reform agenda so there the

318
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:39,459
cooperation element is is is very

319
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:42,059
important sorry I interrupt not no

320
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:46,569
question we're not just regulating ya

321
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:48,069
raat ko I just want to read from the

322
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:50,349
interpreter of perspective this sounds

323
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,939
really nice right just leave us to do

324
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,269
whatever but I can tell you from the

325
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:57,189
experience that a lot of smaller

326
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,809
companies startups new ventures in the

327
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:00,670
country which doesn't have and I heard

328
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,829
that also here like not too many

329
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,990
business angel investing there's no

330
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:06,430
there's no property take rents for

331
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,649
from the government or from European

332
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,779
Union yeah I think like at least I'm

333
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:13,690
looking at in my country like nine out

334
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:16,360
of the ten recent successes let's call

335
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:18,610
them started with the I don't know 40 50

336
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,040
K investment grant from from the

337
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,930
government and they also looked into the

338
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,550
ways how they can lower the cost of the

339
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,189
operation so they went into like three

340
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,930
year programs of Microsoft or other

341
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,520
companies where they get environment you

342
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,649
know ain't nothing it will be really

343
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,140
really really hard and I think that's

344
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:37,330
the role of government European Union

345
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,640
different other organizations so if

346
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:41,920
until we have a proper infrastructure in

347
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,130
place in the terms of capital you know

348
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,319
we should we should do that it does make

349
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,540
sense but then it that implies or some

350
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,310
other things and a huge support for the

351
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,310
community okay

352
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,450
