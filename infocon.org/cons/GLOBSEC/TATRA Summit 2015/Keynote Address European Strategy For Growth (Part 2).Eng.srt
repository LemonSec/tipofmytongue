1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,780
utt compensate by accepting the loan

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:13,500
offers of the EU bank or others the eib

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,299
group will in addition to its normal

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,180
business increased significantly its

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,000
lending activity at the risk end and

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:24,420
mobilize we are sure far more than 300

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,859
billion additional of private capital

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,390
over the next three years in modernizing

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,529
Europe's economy and supporting growth

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,600
and employment this figure of 315

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,070
billion I mean this sounds will obscure

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,219
precise but it's simply the

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,719
multiplication of 21 by the factor of 15

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,489
which we consider the many more we will

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,899
achieve but this figure it sounds

16
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:48,239
probably quite huge might sound

17
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,210
artificial in its anticipated accuracy

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,980
and it might sound like alchemy but at

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,699
the end the figure is the result of pure

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,959
mathematics which I've just described

21
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,570
affected by the way which we believe is

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,809
realistic when we implemented the

23
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,119
increase of the 10 billion paid in

24
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,619
capital to year of to air B which the

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,040
heads of state and government decided

26
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,439
back in 2012 we promised at this time to

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,390
mobilize an additional 180 billion of

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,339
private investments within three years

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:24,600
hence calculating effector 18 thank you

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,030
very much the three years given to us in

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,820
order to achieve that goal will end at

32
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,220
the 31st of december this year and i can

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,130
report to you that by the 25th of march

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,679
we had reached the 180 billion so this

35
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,509
is done and had we simply continued we

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,310
would have ended at a factor of far

37
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:46,710
beyond 25 under these circumstances but

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,720
as I said before this is not now the

39
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,320
issue anymore now the issue is risk

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,149
bearing capacity and not liquidity so we

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,829
delivered and this makes that optimistic

42
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,600
that we will be able to deliver on the

43
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,880
investment for Europe though of course

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,009
the increase and the structure of the

45
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,860
new projects will be challenging but

46
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,139
though the governance structure of FC is

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,750
just about to get into place we just

48
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:13,690
nominated or Parliament confirmed the

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,060
managing director

50
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,560
this deputy we have the steering board

51
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,230
in place the investment committee will

52
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,490
be put into place this week so by the

53
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,709
end of the year we will have approved

54
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,050
higher risk projects already of

55
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,940
approximately nine billion euros

56
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,780
generating around 44 billion of

57
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,030
investment so without the the management

58
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,310
and the system is fully operational yet

59
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,410
by the end of the year we will have

60
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,710
mobilized already or of roughly 50

61
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:45,600
billion out of the 315 promise so we are

62
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:48,040
quite optimistic this was only possible

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,329
due to our decision not to wait for the

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,709
governance structure to get into place

65
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,780
but to start with the rollout of the

66
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,300
yoga plan in substance as quick as

67
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,600
possible by the so-called warehousing of

68
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,880
projects we were criticized for this by

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,460
the European Parliament but we have

70
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,280
reviewed that criticism because we were

71
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,800
asked by the European Council not to

72
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,380
wait but to make sure that first visible

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,230
signs come into play very very soon and

74
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,840
in order to achieve this we decided in

75
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,000
our normal due diligence process about

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,860
the quality of the project took these

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,310
projects onto the balance sheet of the

78
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,140
bank with the hope of shifting them one

79
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,480
day under the umbrella of the younger

80
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,640
plan guarantee once the institution is

81
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,200
fully established of these projects

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,238
around half support renewable energy

83
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,970
energy efficiency and other investments

84
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,850
that contribute to low-carbon growth the

85
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,290
others include R&D and industrial

86
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,600
innovation digital and social

87
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,640
infrastructure transport as well as

88
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,820
access to finance for smaller companies

89
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,540
in parallel the european investment fund

90
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:57,730
our subsidiary which we organized

91
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,290
together with the european commission we

92
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,390
are the sixty percent shareholder the

93
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,090
commission of 30 and national promotion

94
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:06,579
banks and others share the rest of the

95
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,320
remaining ten percent the eif is

96
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,940
delivering impressive results in favor

97
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,609
of smaller businesses as part of the

98
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,100
yoga plan the EF has already signed more

99
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,620
than 50 operations with total financing

100
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,690
under FC of around 1.2 billion with

101
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,470
which is expected to trigger more than

102
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,990
70 billion of investments some 65,000

103
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,370
SMEs are expected to benefit throughout

104
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,400
the whole european union

105
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,520
and furthermore we need to be aware that

106
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,429
FC as integral part of EAB will account

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,000
only for roughly one-third of Abby's

108
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:42,070
activities we must not neglect

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,020
delivering on the other two-thirds as we

110
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,940
need to mobilize around 200 million a

111
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,448
billion euros of private investments on

112
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,900
a yearly basis and second we are

113
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:54,760
enhancing our advisory activities within

114
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,669
the framework of the so-called european

115
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:02,020
advisory hub when i arrived here at the

116
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:04,359
bank in 2012 i was overwhelmed by the

117
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,729
wealth of expertise this bank has to

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,650
offer when it comes also to the

119
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,710
technical assessment of a project you

120
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,280
will not find a bank in the world with a

121
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:18,539
broader base of engineering and natural

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,239
science capacity than in Luxembourg

123
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:23,889
every investment was not be when it

124
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,860
comes to environmental social and legal

125
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:28,150
implications many private and public

126
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,450
investors rely on the technical

127
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,400
expertise of EIB not only taking year be

128
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,919
involvement as a proof of a son project

129
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,770
but also rely on the technical advice

130
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,680
the Ewbank has to offer and we are

131
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,780
enhancing our advising activities for

132
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,580
example by widening the scope of some

133
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,369
instruments like justice to all Member

134
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,710
State sage but also by offering our

135
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,360
support with a new advisory hub and now

136
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,729
that we celebrate ten years of just as

137
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,979
very soon we can say that here in

138
00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:00,909
Central and Eastern Europe justice has

139
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:03,969
proven its worth and when I addressed

140
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:07,690
the European Council three years ago in

141
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,120
June I told them it is time to get away

142
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,610
from the differentiation between old and

143
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,470
new Europe and we have to look at the

144
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,570
needs of the European countries and

145
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,770
regions and you will find out that there

146
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,330
are regions in Central and Eastern

147
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,859
Europe which are so far advanced now

148
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,870
that justice activities are simply not

149
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,910
needed anymore while in parts of Spain

150
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,710
or France it is urgently needed to offer

151
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,830
these services there as well so this is

152
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,690
why the finance ministers and the

153
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,359
European Council have agreed to extend

154
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,120
the Justice activities to all member

155
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,800
states who are in need that should be

156
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,960
the criterium of the old

157
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,410
differentiations

158
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:47,469
and we are will continue to do that no

159
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,900
with the advisory hub the third strand

160
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,480
of the yoga plan is all about removing

161
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,669
barriers of investment in this part the

162
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,490
ball lies more in the field of the

163
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:00,040
member states however we can contribute

164
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,350
by identifying these barriers we come

165
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,960
across in our daily business with

166
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,990
clients or within our advisory advisory

167
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,900
capacity concrete results and impact on

168
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,940
the real economy will be significant if

169
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,640
these three pillars are equally

170
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,910
addressed unlocking investment capacity

171
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:22,450
and deepening the European Union's four

172
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,100
main domains I've mentioned strategic

173
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,170
investor infrastructure and innovation

174
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,080
at the beginning it's the two pillars

175
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,400
two pillars of yabbies activity the

176
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,640
remaining pillars are the support for

177
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,890
SNES nowadays speaking in terms of

178
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,690
volume the largest pillar which only

179
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,180
shows the necessity of EIB being present

180
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,540
in those market must really severely hit

181
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:47,080
by the debt crisis last year we had

182
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:49,150
265,000 SMEs in the new portfolio across

183
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,130
the entire European Union and when the

184
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,140
bank was found in 1958 nobody would have

185
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,030
even dreamt of having eiv activities in

186
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,870
the field of SMEs at that time it was

187
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,489
exclusively an infrastructure bank after

188
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:05,140
everybody could see the ruins of World

189
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:07,780
War two I just visited nkosi and Athens

190
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:11,789
this week in Cyprus or exposure amounts

191
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:14,799
to 14.2 percent of Cypriot gdp 14.2 in

192
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,140
Greece we were active in the country

193
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,640
when the crisis hit its peak and no

194
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,460
other bank was ready to give loans in

195
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,219
the country anymore we stayed and from

196
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,739
2012 to 2030 we even managed to triple

197
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,500
our activity our overall exposure to

198
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,169
amounts to 17 billion euros which is

199
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,620
just below ten percent of the Greek GDP

200
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,689
an enormous amount these figures show

201
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,340
that our lending to SMEs is crucial for

202
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,930
the economies of these member states in

203
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,820
order to support sustainable growth and

204
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:45,880
deployment it doesn't make sense to the

205
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,410
lament about the difficulties the so

206
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,480
called institutions are constantly

207
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,699
facing with the Greek government and the

208
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,850
Greek authorities if you don't address

209
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,680
the questions of

210
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,050
the real economy and those who have good

211
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,329
ideas have good products and sometimes

212
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,339
are severely hit by constraints which

213
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,920
the market necessarily or under this

214
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:06,139
necessarily brings about when pursuing

215
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,290
their businesses it's heartbreaking to

216
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:14,480
see how many well functioning perfectly

217
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,089
future-oriented innovative businesses in

218
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,399
in Greece are hampered to make progress

219
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:22,190
because of this and therefore we

220
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,930
concentrate more than ever on this kind

221
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,269
of our activities in Greece in order to

222
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,819
take care of the real economy and not

223
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,920
just talking about state finances we are

224
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:35,329
not a state financer anyway so we are

225
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,040
targeted at the real economy but it's

226
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:39,439
not only these countries in which the

227
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,800
SMEs have difficulties getting access to

228
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,540
finance as I mentioned before last but

229
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,139
definitely not least we are very active

230
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:52,009
when it comes to climate policies we are

231
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:54,259
a treaty based institution the treaty on

232
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:57,620
European Union tells us what to do since

233
00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:00,290
it was written in 1956 and and act in

234
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,959
1958 the treaty on european union says

235
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,610
the Ewbank is there in order to

236
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,619
contribute what we would in modern

237
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,250
language call the completion of the

238
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,930
internal market and secondly is there in

239
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,670
order to level out differences in the

240
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:15,349
economic development in the regions of

241
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:17,449
the then beginning european economic

242
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,920
community because at that time it was

243
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,990
evident that were a parts of the

244
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,149
european communities which benefited

245
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:25,459
less from the marshall plan planned in

246
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:28,880
other parts of the of western europe at

247
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:30,199
that time and since then our objectives

248
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,120
are being set by the decisions of the

249
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:34,579
European Council in climate action is

250
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,380
now a decisive objective of the European

251
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:38,290
Union set out in the decisions of the

252
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:41,750
European Council so we pursue them and

253
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,639
on our road to Paris I've just recently

254
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,769
announced in Lima during the IMF World

255
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,899
Bank meeting that we will increase our

256
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,370
lending supporting climate action in the

257
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:51,380
developing countries that is where the

258
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,810
effect of climate product is the highest

259
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,980
from 25 to twenty to thirty five percent

260
00:10:53,810 --> 00:11:00,739
until 2020 and our learning activities

261
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,810
within the European Union are targeted

262
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,440
clearly and consequently

263
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:10,529
the 25-percent crew supporting climate

264
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,700
action I will conclude by saying that

265
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:17,070
despite the many crises in Europe I

266
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,830
remain a structural optimist and I am

267
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:23,550
sure that we will find solutions but we

268
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:25,740
need more exploitation of the options

269
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,349
the market offers us when it comes to

270
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,930
bringing scarce public resources and

271
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,730
private funds together we need

272
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,310
intelligent instruments sound

273
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:38,060
instruments to do that and we need to

274
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:42,859
quite honest more European thinking and

275
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,859
more European you

276
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,300
you
