1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
an information that I should finish in

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,340
five minutes so I five minutes late but

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,929
i would like to wrap up this discussion

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:14,040
many very good points has been has been

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,310
mentioned here and the top ones that I

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,970
chose are that we need actually a

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,490
matchmaking platform that would boost

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,490
also very risky and business angel

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,680
investments to to startup projects we

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,869
should focus also on business education

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,210
and educating or changing the culture

12
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,550
and the perception of entrepreneurship

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:40,230
in general starting already at very

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,968
early stages of education shall also

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,349
mentioned the point that we should

16
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,629
centralized institutions that are

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,129
focusing on innovation this is the case

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,379
of course of the office of the chief

19
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,149
scientist I know the case of Slovakia

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,649
there are several institutions starting

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,980
from the ministry of economy ministry of

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,270
education and various agencies who are

23
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:00,930
focusing on innovation and there is very

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,730
hard it's very hard to achieve or

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,659
fulfill some some kind of coordination

26
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,820
between these these bodies also ratico

27
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,369
you mentioned that we should try to

28
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,020
involve corporates and we are trying to

29
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:18,390
do that in our everyday job because we

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,100
procedure in terms of supporting

31
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,890
innovation we are trying to connect the

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,869
private sphere with the government with

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,020
the academia with small a middle sized

34
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,409
enterprises and also with corporates so

35
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,939
we see a crucial added value for

36
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:36,500
innovation that the corporates can also

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:40,048
play in this ecosystem and of course

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:43,799
Tony you mentioned that scaling up is

39
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,240
one of the top questions or top problems

40
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,880
that we should tackle here in the

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,669
European Union we still need to learn

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,060
from from the US best practices because

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,930
their companies are scaling up on a much

44
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,430
faster pass than here in Europe and you

45
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,259
mentioned that we should partner a role

46
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,270
we are trying to do it here within the

47
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,340
visa grad region but you are trying to

48
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,520
do it also on a European level and also

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,270
on an international level because

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,290
yesterday we have invited 11 people from

51
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,019
all around the world

52
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,179
Silicon Valley from London from Israel

53
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,280
from Finland and many other countries

54
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,379
who participated here in an advisory

55
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,299
board there is the advisory board of the

56
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:26,849
ministry of economy and they are trying

57
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:29,370
to assist us with the direction on what

58
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:32,159
we should do as the government in terms

59
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,859
of supporting and enhancing innovation

60
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,170
so we are really trying to cooperate

61
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:41,370
this is actually our basic principle at

62
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,518
our work and I hope that the fruits will

63
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,170
be actually tangible very soon and I

64
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,629
would like to ask also the private

65
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,780
sphere to be very patient because

66
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:57,120
because you know the police is it takes

67
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,220
some time to have an effect in the in

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,409
the economy so thank you very much thank

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,959

70
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:06,298

71
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,500
like now my friend Robert Bosch to

72
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:14,480

74
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,780

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:32,560
last one the last speaker and to do I do

76
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:36,069
from lunch but I won't have a long

77
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,220
speech only 40 minutes don't worry I

78
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:41,679
will make it really fast because all the

79
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,080
smart things already said during the

80
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,390
last three days and I can get any

81
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,489
smarter than the 80 excellent speakers

82
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,470
that we have had here during the last

83
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,150
three days and I would like to thank for

84
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,280
all the panelists that have contributed

85
00:03:52,150 --> 00:04:01,000
to the success of this conference thank

86
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:04,390
you so just let me give you a little

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,220
statistics and a little assessment

88
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,679
whether we achieved what we wanted to

89
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,959
achieve first of all we we set several

90
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,569
objectives and goals for this year's

91
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,640
tetris ami we wanted to build a platform

92
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:17,500
that will not only be an integral part

93
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,810
to create a platform which would

94
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,330
symbolize the ambition of Central Europe

95
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,160
to be a driving force of political

96
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,190
change and economic change in Europe and

97
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,880
I think that we've achieved that when I

98
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:35,500
look into the number of participants 800

99
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:39,310
participants from 35 countries including

100
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:42,910
70 media members I think we achieved a

101
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,280
lot this year so I think that deserves a

102
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:48,880
big things for everybody who has come

103
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,090
here to Bratislava thank you the second

104
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,849
objective was to generate ideas on the

105
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:58,719
future of Europe and I think we had

106
00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:01,210
three days of inspiring debates not only

107
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,849
in this room but also in the dozens of

108
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,820
side meetings that we had policies

109
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,590
sessions business meetings in the

110
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,860
sidelines in the corridors in the

111
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:14,770
meeting rooms and these meetings have

112
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,139
contributed to tackle a very concrete

113
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,840
issues for the future of Europe and it

114
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,669
is up to all of us that these ideas do

115
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,539
not stay only in this hotel in this room

116
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:28,870
we will work with them in the future the

117
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,770
third objective was to facilitate the

118
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,410
discussion between

119
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,969
in business and government because we

120
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,300
believe and if we want to boost yo yo yo

121
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,300
yo yo
