1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
oh and thank you all for coming to what

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:07,410
is clearly a star-studded panel tonight

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,210
and my name today actually sorry my name

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,650
is Gabrielle Steinhauser I'm across

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,740
London for the wall street journal in

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,980
Brussels and I'm very very pleased to

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,140
have this great panel today to discuss

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,640
this very very important question of

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,580
future of the European monetary union am

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,449
as a journalist who covers this very

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,009
very closely I will say that it has been

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,530
rather frustrating in the last few

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,750
months because nothing seems to be

14
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,390
really moving a few years ago we were

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,940
talking quite in detail about some very

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,610
exciting concepts for the eurozone such

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,339
as its own budget its own finance

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,350
minister and all these ideas seem to

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,750
have kind of stepped into the background

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,670
and I'm really hoping that today here

21
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,800
with this panel we can give a new

22
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,090
impetus to the debate and I've asked

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,370
everybody to be as provocative as

24
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:05,159
possible so I'm really excited for some

25
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,920
new ideas and on the panel today we have

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,049
with us the European Commission's vice

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,840
president for the euro valdis

28
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:17,490
dombrovskis and at the Slovak the Slovak

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,189
deputy prime minister and finance

30
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,600
minister peter Kazmir who I as a

31
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,908
brussels-based journalist will say

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,869
always makes the best comments on the

33
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,479
doorstep lots of lots of loves lots of

34
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,180
great quotes he has a high profile in

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,979
Europe I will I will tell you that next

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,729
to him we have the Austrian finance

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,700
minister and Hans you're telling who

38
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:45,840
also makes us very happy on the doorstep

39
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:51,360
very often so thank you for that and

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:55,409
then finally we have the Maltese finance

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:59,490
minister ski glue nuh who I sometimes

42
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:02,130
call dr. doom because he has been known

43
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,679
to make some rather gloomy SH statements

44
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,259
but hopefully we'll find some positive

45
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,599
ideas from him today and then finally

46
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,910
going to involve who's the head of the

47
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,209
brugal think tank in Brussels which is

48
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,359
turning ten years

49
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,790
this year and we're very pleased to have

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,910
him he's always one of the great and

51
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,280
thoughtful voices on this and now I will

52
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,560
ask the vice president to take the floor

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:36,160
and deliver his keynote address and then

54
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:40,630
we will come back to the panel thank you

55
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,549
so good afternoon everybody honorable

56
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,920
Deputy Prime Minister honorable

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,740
ministers excellencies ladies and

58
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,619
gentlemen first of all I would like to

59
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,830
thank for this invitation and for a

60
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:57,880
possibility to participate in a toddler

61
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:02,470
summit and to address issue of deepening

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:04,990
economic and monetary union Europe has

63
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:09,070
gone through serious financial and

64
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:12,580
economic crisis recently but it must be

65
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:15,430
say that euro area is emerging from this

66
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,090
crisis more resilient and there are a

67
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:23,010
number of things we are having now which

68
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:27,130
we were not having just five years ago

69
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,609
in terms of euro area's ability to

70
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:34,630
withstand financial and economic shocks

71
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:38,620
so we have strengths and EU economic and

72
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:40,840
budgetary rules we hell now we now

73
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,390
coordinate our policies throughout the

74
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,150
year within the framework of European

75
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,579
semester and this was something which

76
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,610
was largely absent before the crisis

77
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,720
there were stability and growth pact

78
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,000
unfortunately many countries were not

79
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,970
following the rules of stability and

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,190
growth pact and not much happened as a

81
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:04,270
consequence so now we really have much

82
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:07,570
more robust fiscal and macro economic

83
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:10,000
governance framework we also have an

84
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,400
effective financial backstop european

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,580
stability mechanism to help euro area

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,769
countries in financial difficulty and we

87
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,690
have a banking Union to stabilize our

88
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:22,060
banking sector and to ensure that

89
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,950
taxpayers are not first in line to pay

90
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:30,030
for the mistakes in a banking sector

91
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:33,200
and the European Central Bank is using

92
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:37,919
its monetary policy tools to the full

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,520
potential just to give one example it

94
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,700
was famous Mario Draghi's whatever it

95
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,479
takes which help to stop financial

96
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,640
instability in a euro area and whatever

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,040
it takes was referring to the outright

98
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,919
monetary transactions so European

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,010
Central Bank's commitment to purchase

100
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,030
member states bonds in a secondary

101
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,920
market in unlimited quantities if

102
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,960
necessary and several months ago

103
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,700
European Court of Justice actually

104
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,000
confirmed all tried monetary

105
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:16,140
transactions being in line with the ECB

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,690
mandate and actually we saw a more

107
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:23,060
resilient euro area during the recent

108
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:27,120
crisis in Greece unlike the situation in

109
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:30,300
2010-2011 there was no domino effect and

110
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,210
despite the very turbulent and very

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,090
difficult negotiations there were very

112
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,609
few spillover effects to other euro area

113
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:48,869
countries and the stability of the euro

114
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:52,320
area was not in question then to come

115
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,990
back to come to the question of economic

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:01,080
developments we are now seeing Europe's

117
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:03,870
economy growing in fact just some

118
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,690
minutes ago european commission

119
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:12,870
published its autumn economic forecast

120
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:15,650
showing that we continue to help modest

121
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:19,350
economic recovery but this a curry is

122
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:24,359
gradually strengthening in boss euro

123
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:27,890
area and in EU 28 but as this growth is

124
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:32,580
to extend backed by temporary factors

125
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:35,340
such as low energy prices low euro

126
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,280
exchange rate which is helping us

127
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,919
exporters and ECB's accommodative

128
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,159
monetary policy including

129
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:48,020
to do easing and the recovery is still

130
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:52,520
vulnerable to external shocks so we now

131
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:55,460
must use as a time which we help do to

132
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,919
those temporary positive factors we must

133
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,909
use this time wisely to reform the

134
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,850
structure of our economies as also Mario

135
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,300
Draghi has outlined that you cannot

136
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:12,560
solve structural problems in the economy

137
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:14,840
only with monetary policy tools and we

138
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,640
need to go further and to make the final

139
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,530
steps to make economic and monetary

140
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,020
union more durable more stable and to

141
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,809
ensure that its lives up to its

142
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,240
potential so the report of the five

143
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,060
presidents presidents of the five EU

144
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,900
institutions on the completing say mu

145
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,640
shows the way it presents a vision and

146
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,870
the role model for completing the

147
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:44,360
economic and monetary union by 2025 and

148
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:47,510
it underlines the need for economic and

149
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,490
social convergence this means bringing

150
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:53,000
and economic and social levels across

151
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:56,030
Europe closer together and closer to the

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,700
best performers so to have a convergence

153
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,369
towards the top not race to the bottom

154
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,969
and with convergence we mean convergence

155
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:08,900
both within and between or among member

156
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:13,220
states so progress needs to be done in

157
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,960
parallel on four fronts first towards

158
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,420
the generating economic union that

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,669
ensures that each economy has a

160
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:23,180
structural features to prosper within

161
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,890
the EMU second towards financial union

162
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,050
to increase the risk sharing with the

163
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,650
private sector complete banking Union

164
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:33,020
and accelerate capital markets union

165
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:35,929
search towards fiscal union to deliver

166
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,350
both fiscal sustainability and fiscal

167
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:41,630
stabilization and first word stronger

168
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,050
political union including stronger

169
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,480
democratic accountability legitimacy and

170
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:49,969
institutional strengthening it's an

171
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,610
ambitious project it's do not happen

172
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,390
overnight but we can make progress

173
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,970
already

174
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,710
II know two weeks ago European

175
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,900
Commission put forward a package of

176
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,840
initiatives that can be taken within the

177
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,420
existing treaty and within existing

178
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,600
legal basis something what we call

179
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:10,699
deepening by doing and we see these

180
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,710
initiatives as a stepping stones towards

181
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,980
the second stage for a more far-reaching

182
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:18,200
measures to complete the email so now

183
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:22,520
let me mention the most important

184
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:24,050
initiatives on economic governance we

185
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,939
proposed to improve the rules and

186
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,579
mechanisms we helped put together in

187
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,650
recent years to look at economic policy

188
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,160
as a matter of common European concern

189
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:36,110
and in particular the European semester

190
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,300
so we aim to better integrate the euro

191
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:42,560
area and the national dimension in the

192
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:46,040
European semester and to do so with more

193
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,140
transparency and blessed complexity we

194
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,939
will put more emphasis on social and

195
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,189
employment developments including by

196
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,140
involving EU and national social

197
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,600
partners even more in decision-making

198
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,250
and will promote convergence by

199
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,440
benchmarking and pursuing best practices

200
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,150
the Phi president report recognizes the

201
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,420
increasingly important role of

202
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,670
competitiveness in our economies the

203
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,699
crisis revealed underlying problems of

204
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,290
competitiveness and deep economic

205
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,810
macroeconomic imbalances in your area

206
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,569
countries without the possibility to

207
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:23,569
adjust currency exchange rates in

208
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,310
individual euro area countries proper

209
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,740
adjustment mechanisms are needed to

210
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,680
identify and address complete

211
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,480
competitiveness challenges early on

212
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,489
where therefore proposing national

213
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,040
competitiveness boards to be set up in

214
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,890
euro area member states so it would be

215
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,620
independent bodies which would track for

216
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,560
example how wages costs and other

217
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:49,100
competitiveness factors developed within

218
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,930
member states on the fiscal side we will

219
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,690
continue applying the existing rules

220
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:55,489
created by the six pack and two pack but

221
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,220
we need to do more to ensure full

222
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:01,400
transparency we are therefore setting a

223
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,140
new European fiscal board five high

224
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,360
level experts will work in full

225
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,680
independence to provide advice on the

226
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,420
implementation of fiscal

227
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,520
rules and contribute to greater

228
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:15,550
transparency at the same time we need to

229
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,020
increase democratic legitimacy and

230
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,880
accountability we will work more closely

231
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,520
with national parliaments social

232
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,350
partners and others and we will engage

233
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,949
with the European Parliament in

234
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,529
democratic debates on shared priorities

235
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,899
it is equally important to ensure that

236
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:35,330
our voice is strong and the global stage

237
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,640
it will make sense to consolidate our

238
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,279
position and to hell unified stance

239
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,870
internationally so we've proposed to

240
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:44,120
gradually develop a unified

241
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,730
representation of the euro area in the

242
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,170
International Monetary Fund we propose

243
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,970
that the president of the Eurogroup

244
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:54,290
should ultimately represents the euro

245
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:56,240
area internationally finally in a short

246
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,339
time we have created banking unions that

247
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,640
underpins confidence in our banks and

248
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:03,709
safeguards financial stability but we

249
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,870
need to finish what we have started in

250
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:08,779
fact a particular we help to implement

251
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,520
what has been agreed so far the bank

252
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:12,730
resolution and recovery directive and

253
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,290
the deposit guarantee scheme directive

254
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,600
we need to reach an agreement on the

255
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,760
bridge financing on the single fund

256
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,029
which comes into force at the beginning

257
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,650
of the next year and we plan to move

258
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,200
towards European Deposit Insurance

259
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:30,140
Scheme building on a mechanism of

260
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,140
reinsurance and we want to continue to

261
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,720
reduce risks in European banking system

262
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,610
the Commission will present legislative

263
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,880
proposals on deposit insurance before

264
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:43,550
the end of the year and at the end of

265
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,520
the day people have to be confident that

266
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,270
their savings are safe regardless in we

267
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,850
were in Europe their bank is located all

268
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:56,180
the measures I have set out can be

269
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,040
worked on right now but at some point we

270
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:00,500
will need a more far-reaching measures

271
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,160
to complete the EMU some requiring

272
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:06,290
treaty change in spring 2017 the

273
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,500
Commission will set out concrete ideas

274
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,329
to fully complete mu but reflections on

275
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,240
the second stage of completing m you

276
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:16,880
must start now and we want to consult

277
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,060
broadly gathering ideas from across

278
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,420
Europe because our main challenge is to

279
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,459
shape

280
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,540
census for these more fundamental steps

281
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:30,319
not only among governments but also

282
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,839
among Europe's citizens ladies and

283
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,269
gentlemen a successful economic and

284
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,300
monetary union is in the interest of all

285
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:40,130
EU member states and it is in the

286
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,310
interest of all member states that we

287
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,560
can deepen EMU so we do not create new

288
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:49,189
barriers towards member states that

289
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:51,349
shall not that have not yet joined the

290
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,120
euro the European Commission is

291
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:56,389
committed to keeping the process of

292
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,880
deepening EMU transparent and respecting

293
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:03,380
the integrity of the EU internal market

294
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,199
and I personally want to the ones that

295
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,689
completing EMU will make the euro I even

296
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:11,510
more attractive currency also for those

297
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,760
member states that so far how not joined

298
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:18,819
in thank you very much and I'm looking

299
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,819
forward for the discussion thank you
