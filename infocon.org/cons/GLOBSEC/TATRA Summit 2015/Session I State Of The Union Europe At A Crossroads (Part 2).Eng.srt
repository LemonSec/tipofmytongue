you

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,500
you

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,420
you

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,480
you

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,480
you

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,490
you

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,980
you

8
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,470
you

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,990
you

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,990
you

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,980
you

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,490
you

13
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,010
you

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,490
you

15
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,480
you

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,479
you

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,969
you

18
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:12,969
you

19
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,979
you

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,500
you

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,960
some camps you decide by majority

22
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:29,850
because otherwise our treaty are useless

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:33,080
and it is clear that we have we have it

24
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,179
we have to play by our rules otherwise

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,789
they divide and the device would be

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,619
bigger and bigger and the mutual

27
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:43,380
distrust would be bigger and bigger we

28
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:47,009
have to be very serious about our common

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,158
policy never common rules and not not

30
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,110
dramatize whether whether we have to

31
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
implement an issue which has been

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,509
decided by my saw it Whittle it happens

33
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:01,200
very often and and it is clear that this

34
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:05,130
is one one very specific issues but

35
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,380
around which we must build up our common

36
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,720
trust then I was saying the lack of

37
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:11,730
common culture it is here that this lack

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,569
of common culture that we must

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,149
absolutely work on it comes up very

40
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:21,089
clearly on foreign policy issues only

41
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,989
breed potna broad policy issues it is

42
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:26,549
clear that I mean our approach I mean it

43
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,140
is clear that I mean in our continent

44
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,200
you cannot change the border with the

45
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,820
tanks because we have we have built up

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,000
the European Union because we don't want

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,400
to change the border with the text and

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,870
it was very good that we had a unanimous

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,239
reaction on this on what happen but it

50
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:49,320
is also clear and we have to work on

51
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,420
that that our perception of our common

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,829
interest english in the medium and long

53
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,790
term about a big nipples like Russia are

54
00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:01,890
very different in today's Europe and it

55
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,790
is clear that if we do not forge a

56
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,589
common culture and a common approach to

57
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,510
fundamental issues which are linked to

58
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,319
our vital interests such as I don't

59
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,888
choose our nibbles p and in the mail

60
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,480
train ian then there are many tests do

61
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:23,940
we manage to forge a common cut or not

62
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,730
because it is clear that if we do we can

63
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,859
have an impact if we don't we spend

64
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,190
hours and hours of difficult negotiation

65
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,150
and and and I think that in oh no this

66
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,890
is really but when members

67
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,920
the reality and our whose leader is

68
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:41,708
trying to do just that in Brussels to

69
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,078
change treaties to make a compromise if

70
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,510
you like the brexit debate has opened

71
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,280
this Pandora's box and whatever happens

72
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,569
every single country is going to say you

73
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,420
know what I want this and I want that

74
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:54,640
and this is common on anything from from

75
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,059
milk prices to how to deal with Putin

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,768
will will erode I think Britain shown

77
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,959
extraordinary solidarity if you measured

78
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,879
in terms of net contribution and we are

79
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,980
the second biggest netqin Alan Gross and

80
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:10,090
grow stones in gross terms we contribute

81
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,798
on 27 billion euros to the budget to the

82
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,030
year of the European Union so I think in

83
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,660
that respect we do show a lot of

84
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,738
solidarity and though we have a problem

85
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,899
it's a slight disembark thing

86
00:04:17,738 --> 00:04:21,548
particularly of the nation that we've

87
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:24,520
seen the limits of it we've seen it here

88
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:26,948
in this and stretch as i dip my gray but

89
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,930
never russia yes clearly there was a lot

90
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,300
of solidarity shown over the sanctions

91
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,889
against Russia over the annex up you

92
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,440
know the insurgents of a sovereign

93
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:38,199
states territory Ukraine but now we have

94
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,360
this dilemma imputed noses you mentioned

95
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:44,530
solving the Syrian civil war we have to

96
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,900
talk to Putin to find a solution to what

97
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,150
happens in Syria clearly here if its

98
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,280
proposed the Saudis at you know support

99
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,549
and we need to also to talk now to

100
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,229
Russia probably Assad's government as

101
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,870
part of the solution and not just the

102
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,699
problem to stabilize Syria but I'm not

103
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,229
convinced adjust Syria alone because

104
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,120
then you have the whole chunks of Iraq

105
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,039
we have to defeat but there are large

106
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,240
numbers of refugee milling come on this

107
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,740
is this is my point i mean we're talking

108
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,630
about all these enormous issues and

109
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,639
britain is making sure Brussels is focus

110
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,020
on this you know a few sentences in a

111
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,610
treaty I mean it is Brett see a

112
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,020
distraction because it's a firm page

113
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,520
made the primate made by the Prime

114
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,990
Minister and we're going to deliver on

115
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,479
it and I'm going to be campaigned to

116
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,880
stay in the European Union I'm confident

117
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,680
he will get some kind of a package but I

118
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,930
there's a real risk and the biggest risk

119
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,320
in my view is a very narrow victory one

120
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,909
way or the other and the losing side not

121
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,050
putting our for making it work for the

122
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,729
country there's a real risk or what I

123
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,430
called never end ins not just your

124
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,320
endless referenda one after the other in

125
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,380
Britain and in other countries in Europe

126
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,820
demanding on these key issues yeah and

127
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,900
so there's a real danger this is a very

128
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,479
unstable time we face

129
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,888
I mean I have some sympathy for my

130
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,659
colleague from Italy here because

131
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,580
clearly we do need to find common

132
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,680
solutions but we also have to be very

133
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,539
respectful of national sensitivities

134
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,039
here and there's no easy way out of this

135
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,229
and we need to have giving Cameron is

136
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,180
the other countries who also seek the

137
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,590
more opt out some more derogations and

138
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,780
the more flexible Europe because

139
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,008
building a country called Europe I don't

140
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,840
think there is the demos there to

141
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:14,000
support that I don't see that we know I

142
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,888
have to be lucky I speak four or five

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,930
European languages I travel I lager

144
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,750
average you know it's Italian from the

145
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,880
South feels totally European and has

146
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,550
huge solidarity with a person the north

147
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,289
of England frankly is is is an elitist

148
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,389
dream at the moment it may happen in the

149
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:31,849
future and maybe my language I mean

150
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,620
English certainly seems to be cementing

151
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,729
the way Brussels work the fact we can

152
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,500
hold this conference today in the

153
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,820
language of Shakespeare is giving a

154
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,800
degree of dialogue which wouldn't have

155
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,229
existed even 50 years ago think that's

156
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,820
the time a Philistine only speaks so you

157
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:45,590
know you know it is amazing some

158
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,449
processes are inevitable but I think we

159
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,489
are in danger of pushing the project too

160
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:51,740
far then if we push it too far too fast

161
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,990
it could actually break up which will be

162
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,880
tragic for peace and security for the

163
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,380
future of all are a stick of dynamite

164
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,150
has now been shoved into the European

165
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,409
project and whatever happens other

166
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,479
countries are going to want piece of it

167
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,610
they're gonna want to have similar power

168
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,990
to change things and then we start going

169
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,699
back with each other integration or can

170
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,919
it can europe push on from brexit

171
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,349
whatever happens what first I hope there

172
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,859
won't be any breaks it there was no

173
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:19,340
closet we'll see about Schengen exit so

174
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,449
I should cycle as regards the brexit rig

175
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:25,609
negotiation it's like if Europe was a

176
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:28,580
big boat not the Titanic am a big boat

177
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,639
trying to avoid many iceberg prices

178
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:35,330
Syria then and at this very moment

179
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:40,300
there's someone coming saying well I'm a

180
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:44,030
VIP I'm i want my cabin refurbished

181
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:47,960
repainted please have a look I have

182
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,780
serious problems this is I sickly well

183
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,549
but talking with is European

184
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,650
counterparts so of course i will

185
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:59,700
consider mr. Campbell but they are very

186
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:01,859
big will they be ready all these ads

187
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:06,510
states and governments to do whatever it

188
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,820
takes to give mr. camp to London saying

189
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:12,450
look at that I obtained this victory and

190
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:16,620
then you can we can we can stay in this

191
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:20,789
union I'm not totally sure because we

192
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,730
are witnessing a vicious cycle whether

193
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:27,540
you like it or not we have been talking

194
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:31,580
about you crisis the Europe rah crysis 3

195
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:37,919
crisis not a single penny to save grease

196
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:40,409
from the refugee crisis well not that

197
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,289
much solidarity even if I perfectly know

198
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:47,219
that the UK is doing a lot in the dumps

199
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:50,010
in in enjoy a perfect it for even 30

200
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,140
first team thank you wonder aliens

201
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:54,810
terminal at rollators what Germany's

202
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,970
show the discrepancies between what the

203
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,890
UK is doing and then in this very no

204
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,750
such solidarity from the UK will be

205
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,240
ready to do whatever it takes and on the

206
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,400
other side i perfectly understand that

207
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,310
the image given by the EU at the moment

208
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,020
is not attractive at all for you for for

209
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,180
british citizens at all because it's too

210
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,790
little too late it's tension so I'm

211
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,910
afraid we're in a kind of vicious cycle

212
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,250
and I'm all the more worried that of

213
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:24,300
course the bridge will not only vote on

214
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:27,210
the text obtain bus by mr. Kemel from

215
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,339
the comp and bit so my and I tell you

216
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,320
from a French experience and because we

217
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,780
have had referendum and the answer given

218
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,120
was not only text it was a lot also very

219
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,280
emotional and personal record and then

220
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,250
my old my last point and my hope is that

221
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,370
you will be able and I hope you will win

222
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,830
your campaign to insist on what was the

223
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,830
slogan that of the the Tory party

224
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,260
manifesto stronger together and that's

225
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:54,690
my point really if we look at all you

226
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,150
have said the crisis in Syria mr.

227
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,310
poutine and I'm not the repeater the

228
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,560
global challenge of course we are

229
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,949
stronger together oh and of course the

230
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,670
you make sense if the UK spot of the EU

231
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,930
and if we can thanks to the UK

232
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,880
contribution Germany and all hunger

233
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,260
together to address these challenges but

234
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,330
I hope that will

235
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,069
be enough depending of the text which

236
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,510
will be obtained by Mr Cameron because

237
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,610
I'm sure we'll come back to London

238
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:23,720
saying look at that it is fantastic a

239
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,130
text I obtained the the best I could I

240
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,650
don't see him doing something different

241
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,720
but i'm afraid the question will be much

242
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,189
a bit much Brian of course and democracy

243
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,110
has its own and he could get lots of

244
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,490
about 20 minutes left so please send

245
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,960
your questions in we've got a few I'm

246
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,090
going to come to them and also vote in

247
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,390
the poll if you could if you could get

248
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:44,040
your smartphones iPads whatever I'm just

249
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,230
we've got one question here which kind

250
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,740
of plays into all this nice stuff you

251
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,430
were referencing the Balkans and and and

252
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,430
economic migrants from there the

253
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,560
question here is this is broken as the

254
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,060
next round of EU accession States and in

255
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,800
the geographic middle of the migration

256
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,569
crisis must be change our security

257
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,219
strategies in the Western Balkans I

258
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:05,310
assume that's our as in the e that's

259
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,660
from an anonymous person I mean it the

260
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,060
way I read oh here we go it's up here

261
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,670
and when I went when I read that I think

262
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,010
well you know aunty integration people

263
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:16,020
will say wait so problem is that we keep

264
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,700
expanding too fast i mean there's this

265
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,410
is a serious point how should the

266
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,480
Western Balkans now and their accession

267
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,920
demands rise up the agenda because of

268
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:29,430
the migration process your I'm gonna

269
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:33,569
shut that one to you do you think I mean

270
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:36,420
I can simply can simplify my life and

271
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,930
just for generation within the next five

272
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:42,839
years so I think this sentence will stay

273
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,390
I think what is needed to develop for

274
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,910
this group let's call them all Western

275
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,240
Balkan countries despite the the

276
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:55,110
difference as they they have and they

277
00:11:50,240 --> 00:12:00,540
they show it's a credible strategy and

278
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:02,340
how they can come closer to the EU in a

279
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,790
sense that at a certain point of time in

280
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:08,310
the future they can join when I've been

281
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,990
to all Western Balkan countries in the

282
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,689
last two years quite a number of times

283
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,260
and if you speak to to someone in

284
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,670
Albania they say listen I want to leave

285
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,980
this country because what's the

286
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:23,130
perspective for me it is more or less

287
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:26,340
identical the situation to how it was

288
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,980
the last ten years ago and there is no

289
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,620
assurance

290
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,630
will change over the next 10 years so

291
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:35,019
then you decide you leave for Italy or

292
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:39,850
Germany or whatsoever so the point is

293
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:43,420
what can we do in the short term knowing

294
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:47,139
that accession will take time and will

295
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:49,569
require efforts from all sides but what

296
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:52,000
can we do in the meantime to create an

297
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,680
economic and social perspective

298
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
especially for the young people there

299
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,550
and of course you can do something with

300
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,320
with legal labor migration but the point

301
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,930
is you want the people to stay in order

302
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,760
to have a future for these countries and

303
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:11,050
what we are trying to do example it's

304
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,410
just a stone in the war but it's better

305
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:17,290
than nothing to establish functioning

306
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,750
vocational training centres in Bosnia

307
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,079
and in Albania this is something when

308
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,000
you have create an education then people

309
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:27,040
might if you bring this up to higher

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,440
political level you you come up with the

311
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,839
the Western Balkan conference that took

312
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,209
place recently in Vienna where I think a

313
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,190
good process were started it dealt with

314
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:39,300
education for the young people but also

315
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,500
with how you foster regional integration

316
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,420
yeah if you look at the network of

317
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,269
motorways it's there's a huge disconnect

318
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:49,269
between these six countries yeah if you

319
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:51,730
try to fly from pristine artists copy

320
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:54,430
you often fly Maya Istanbul and I have

321
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,800
nothing against these simple but that

322
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,290
doesn't make any sense yeah yeah so I

323
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,810
would focus on practical projects as

324
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:05,050
part of these Western Balkan process to

325
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,849
give a perspective for these six country

326
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,540
how they can incur economically and

327
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,550
socially prosper given that II full EU

328
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,230
accession is quite some time away

329
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,449
Charles I know you have a professional

330
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,800
relationship in that region I mean

331
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:20,170
surely it's a good thing the country's

332
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,229
keep wonder you can't be that bad if you

333
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,329
see one to join I think the EU and NATO

334
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,279
accession have been the kind of glue

335
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:29,380
which is kind of bound the region in

336
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,110
some degree of stability and prosperity

337
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,360
and and is in all in all our interest

338
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,160
because if that if that rug is pulled

339
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,779
under their fees and there is a brexit

340
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,610
and unraveling of the whole European

341
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,750
project there's a real danger of

342
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,070
hostilities breaking out

343
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,750
some of those countries and we have a

344
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:46,330
very fragile situation

345
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:49,870
bosnia-herzegovina is barely functioning

346
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:51,580
as okay as a country of state Albania's

347
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,890
got internal problems we've seen you

348
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,540
know huge protest fiona montenegro which

349
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:59,470
was hoping to get its nato accession

350
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,880
invitation in early next year macedonia

351
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,680
has its own problems it got the huge

352
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,520
migratory flows going through some of

353
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,770
these countries and they're all

354
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,970
petrified that you know barriers will

355
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,439
suddenly put up and some of these

356
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,240
refugees will stay there they'll have to

357
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,010
deal with the problem though the Balkans

358
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,740
is it kind of almost like a case study

359
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,390
and what the the carrots of EU

360
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,580
membership can do in terms of

361
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,770
stabilizing that region after 15 years

362
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,960
ago when you had terrible atrocities and

363
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:24,939
civil wars and that's one of the reasons

364
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,340
that I am in favor of Britain staying in

365
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,960
the European Union Wilkins if the whole

366
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,940
project falls apart isn't so much i

367
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,430
think my country will lose terribly by

368
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,080
leaving we may have some economic impact

369
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,599
but it'll be two or three percent of gdp

370
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,420
but we're a big you know you know rich

371
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,010
world trading global economy type

372
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,870
country so I don't think Britain will

373
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,300
the roof will fall in on Britain but I

374
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,790
do worry for the unintended consequences

375
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:51,550
in other parts of Europe including the

376
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,500
Western Balkans and you know EU

377
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,420
membership it still gives us a huge

378
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,320
amounts of influence and resources to

379
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,300
try and stabilize those small countries

380
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,300
but in and we are here in Slovakia

381
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,880
Slovakia has minorities you know in

382
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,199
Serbia and Croatia and so far the

383
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,060
countries which have joined you know

384
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,190
Slovenia Croatia been great success

385
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,160
stories but you know but the hard

386
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,050
problems you know bosnia-herzegovina

387
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:20,170
macedonia albania kosovo again a big

388
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:22,270
issue we haven't sold that you know more

389
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,550
than a decade on although again the EU

390
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:27,069
pristina belgrade dialogue very helpful

391
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,719
a legacy legacy from Cathy Ashton that

392
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,000
was paving the way for better

393
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,580
understanding and I know and I know

394
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,820
Slovakia was very key in in facilitating

395
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:39,580
all of that but it is a it is a

396
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,770
potentially fragile part of the viewer

397
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:45,100
at which we need to nurture very very

398
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:48,310
carefully and I would hate to see the EU

399
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,170
project no longer boss of reform and and

400
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,569
progress Sandra on that point do you

401
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,779
think Europe has to continue to at least

402
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,269
give the impression as open to

403
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,829
was to to ensure that the project

404
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:00,529
continues to grow witness at the apt

405
00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:02,569
momentum yes I do believe that the

406
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,549
Western Balkans should join the European

407
00:17:02,569 --> 00:17:07,220
Union as soon as possible on that I

408
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:09,770
didn't feel any need for this statement

409
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:13,850
of jean-claude Juncker saying in any

410
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,650
case not before 2018 I really I can

411
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,569
understand the political reasons in the

412
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,089
internal European Parliament dynamics

413
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,549
before being voted as president european

414
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:25,208
commission for the rest it was on one

415
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:27,408
side useless on on the other side

416
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:29,480
counterproductive because now we have

417
00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:31,610
the problem of giving new incentive

418
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,950
notable a new generation but in general

419
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,990
to those government was struggling to

420
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,480
comply with the rule with the part that

421
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,580
is required and his right required to

422
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,409
join the European Union so I do believe

423
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,870
that the Western bulk at the place of

424
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:48,799
the battery but Western Balkans lies in

425
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:53,750
Europe and i do believe also that this

426
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:56,330
should push to and we should use the UK

427
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,830
referendum of course we we hope it is

428
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,080
positive at the italian government we

429
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,270
are ready to walk with the break with

430
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,730
the with the british government in the

431
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,860
in the negotiation if is needed to find

432
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,799
positive solution but i think that on

433
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,260
one side we have to use the issue of the

434
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,210
Western Balkans and on the other side we

435
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:17,059
have to use these the issue the UK

436
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,130
referendum to develop a flexibility

437
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,658
policy a differentiation policy within

438
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,110
the European Union which i think that

439
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:26,450
the only way the only way forward from

440
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,789
this perspective I mean because before

441
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,429
was mentioned the ever closer union

442
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:33,530
issue we want an ever closer union where

443
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:36,230
we could say that the union is for all

444
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:39,200
and ever closer union is only for those

445
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:43,429
who wish so I would be would be already

446
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,850
a good a good step a good step I'd my

447
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:48,919
view and of course I don't have any

448
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,209
advice to give and that I don't want

449
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:57,230
what I'm saying to be taken as an advice

450
00:18:52,210 --> 00:19:01,370
but my hope not not mainly as European

451
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:03,679
citizen then as a current remember of

452
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,678
European government I hope that the UK

453
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,520
referendum will be used to find an

454
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,270
explain to the

455
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:14,240
British public the huge benefit of UK

456
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:16,040
membership because even if there is

457
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,370
something which has never been done it

458
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,830
is exactly this to explain to the Brits

459
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,199
that it is in their interest and I

460
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:27,500
already say that is now our interest to

461
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,280
have UK in and we will do what we can 12

462
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,740
UK but I think that it is a big occasion

463
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:37,610
to clarify the debate and to explain

464
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,740
what are the advantages of being as UK

465
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,780
in the Union and in my view as a

466
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,290
politician with organizer for random in

467
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:48,230
being very brave and very open about the

468
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,840
concrete advantages of being a member of

469
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,970
of the European Union it is clear that

470
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,919
the negotiation is important it is clear

471
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,170
that the key issue and this is key issue

472
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,390
for all of us the psyche show for the

473
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,180
forthcoming robot pressing on the

474
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,890
reunion it is a issue for us which want

475
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,990
to use the 60 years of the Treaty of

476
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:08,270
Rome to relearn the political process

477
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:12,140
their issues not the founding the

478
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:14,629
founding member states the disordered

479
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,880
group the issue is how we want to

480
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,640
organize the new relations between a

481
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,740
eurozone which must be deepened from the

482
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,230
political social and democratic point of

483
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,040
view and which must add a fiscal stance

484
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:30,980
at the eurozone as a whole and in a

485
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,260
single market which we want with with UK

486
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,540
we are very committed Italy to depend to

487
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:39,770
complete digital single market services

488
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:42,980
this is the key issue but this issue I I

489
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:46,190
doubt you can I mean I put myself in

490
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,350
Italy I wouldn't win a reference out the

491
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:50,300
British voter will vote yes because hey

492
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,540
we have solved the relations between the

493
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,370
eurozone and a single man attractions

494
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,170
are other important issue but it is a

495
00:20:55,370 --> 00:21:00,860
city of london but after your exactly

496
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:03,590
exactly so this is why less use and i

497
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,139
say as a committed not only committee

498
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,720
european citizen as someone who is very

499
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,890
committed to have UK in the you let's

500
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,260
use it to add a good and open debate on

501
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:18,350
the benefit of being a member of the

502
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:21,200
review and this kind of debate will

503
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,908
certainly help also the debate in the

504
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,990
but can I go start on the Balkans

505
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:26,419
because you mentioned that you wanted

506
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,760
them to join as soon as possible which

507
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,529
strikes me you know very soon and

508
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,330
somewhat unrealistic given the current

509
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:33,710
situation in some of those countries but

510
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,590
do you think there's therefore a need

511
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,149
now to re-examine this idea which is

512
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,918
gathering a little bit of steam in

513
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:41,689
Britain that we need to invent another

514
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,460
category of membership associate

515
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,049
membership where you have some of the

516
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,110
advances like access the single market

517
00:21:45,049 --> 00:21:49,789
you don't have a full four freedoms of

518
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,840
movement of people maybe this would work

519
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:53,000
very well in some of the book and

520
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,299
Western Balkan countries as a sort of

521
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,529
stepping stone a bit like the eea was

522
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:59,269
you know predicted to be a stepping

523
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,740
stone to join the European Union do we

524
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:02,630
need to be creative in our thinking and

525
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,220
come up with new models of geometry for

526
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,610
the European Union because the one size

527
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,830
fits all under the current treaties is

528
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,269
extremely demanding of fragile countries

529
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:14,210
in the Western Balkans in terms of

530
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:15,500
immigration policy in terms of all sorts

531
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,960
of issues to do with you know their

532
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,370
markets and has a competition law state

533
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,960
you're up for this stuff so do we need

534
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,340
to think of new new categories in which

535
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,760
may be Britain would fit quite nicely

536
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,559
into an associate membership you know

537
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,850
bring original Montenegro but I started

538
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:30,529
going I don't like the Norwegian model

539
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:31,760
that's for sure I reject that completely

540
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:34,250
but maybe need to be better than both

541
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:38,480
creams as possible said no to me it is

542
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:40,970
clear that this can can come if we

543
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,159
decide seriously to depend the

544
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,429
integration around the eurozone yeah if

545
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,919
we decide so end if we are clear that we

546
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,590
don't want to oblige anybody to definite

547
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:55,100
integration but we cannot let anybody to

548
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:57,500
veto our willing will of getting into if

549
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,870
we manage to strike this compromise I

550
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,149
think that by the time the issue of a

551
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:04,969
differentiated membership will real race

552
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:08,268
and can also be formalized to me it has

553
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:09,799
already a reality now but if we go to

554
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:11,630
what the direction can be a reality

555
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,389
which would could need also to be

556
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:16,669
formalized and in that case provided the

557
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:18,949
previous condition is satisfied why not

558
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:20,149
why not with rapidly running out of time

559
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,559
so I'm gonna bring it back to the

560
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:24,350
question here which was Europe at a

561
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,850
crossroads and remove the question where

562
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,899
are the crossroads though going straight

563
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,240
on essentially is ignoring the

564
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:32,129
crossroads and ask for view if you could

565
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,960
sum up in 90 seconds each

566
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,490
where does Europe go from here does it

567
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,720
continue driving on ignoring the

568
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:39,030
different routes it could take does it

569
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,800
stop and pause have a cigarette have a

570
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,120
hot dog whatever side of the road wait

571
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,310
for things to subside or does it need to

572
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,300
take a new direction either stop with

573
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:51,570
you well facing a crossroad you could

574
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:56,790
take the u-turn I think the only country

575
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:59,010
could take the u-turn is the UK and I

576
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:02,190
hope it won't happen but at least the

577
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:07,950
question is raised really to be or not

578
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:09,360
to be part of the European Union fact

579
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,130
that if I look at all the other

580
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,740
countries you have mentioned Poland I

581
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:16,290
even taking the example of Slovakia you

582
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:21,030
could mention Greece Portugal France I

583
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:22,440
don't see a majority of people thinking

584
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,649
they are going to take the you to enemy

585
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,470
they are your skepticism yes they are

586
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:31,110
your phobia so people in favor of the

587
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,630
u-turn of an exit to everything of mine

588
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:39,330
lopez's in favor of a global exit euro

589
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:41,970
Schengen your venue but she won't have a

590
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,689
majority support on this point so you

591
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:49,110
turn first option then you can have well

592
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,930
why not the new euros chlorosis meaning

593
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:54,629
now okay we made progress including in

594
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,910
the recent crisis because there were

595
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:59,640
there was an integration of the EMU

596
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:02,670
further integration York has said that

597
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,890
there would be the need to another

598
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:07,110
further integration I agree but maybe

599
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,530
there won't be political energy enough

600
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:13,139
to do this on the refugee crisis there

601
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:15,149
there is there are step further for

602
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,520
example the odd spots on something like

603
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,550
that the relocation mechanism but maybe

604
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,860
too much political energy will be used

605
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,899
and then as be I've been used sorry and

606
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,479
then the political leaders that the

607
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,930
firemen are fed up and then the other

608
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:33,410
fires to take care of and then okay so

609
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:35,280
they don't have energy enough to become

610
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,850
architects and to build something

611
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,410
something different so this scenario is

612
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:42,090
this an eye of what I would call a

613
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,400
bigger Switzerland the

614
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:47,639
would become a bigger Switzerland which

615
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,279
is not that by bad by the way a space of

616
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,760
stability relative prosperity if we

617
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:56,909
compare with the well with no impact at

618
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,400
all on the neighborhood evolution and

619
00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:03,150
the world affair so my last and final

620
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:06,419
scenario maybe not the way out then not

621
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:10,350
stop but maybe going further going up

622
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:12,390
and it would be yes we go further we

623
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,500
have used this crisis we have faced them

624
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:19,590
it has created tensions but still we had

625
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,750
when we were compelled looking at the

626
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:25,620
word I think it's really key setting the

627
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:29,100
agenda looking at the world yes maybe we

628
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:32,969
could remember that we can be diverse

629
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,158
but we are united you could spend an

630
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,529
hour and i know i have only ten seconds

631
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,770
left to say to stress the differences

632
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:44,580
between guy from bratislava and someone

633
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:48,418
from Paris but seen from Beijing is all

634
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,418
the same and I will conclude by quoting

635
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:54,240
my honorary president Pascal Lamy was

636
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,730
traveled a lot for a 3 t.o

637
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,510
director-general he always insists on

638
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:04,110
this point seen from Beijing a Slovakian

639
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:06,360
and a French it's all the same more or

640
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:09,000
less all the same part of the same

641
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,879
Europe and story with the same model

642
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,909
combining it can make efficiency social

643
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:19,289
cohesion Environmental Protection in a

644
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:21,779
pluralist the context so if we focus on

645
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:23,760
this the third option and you have full

646
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,830
understood that's my favorite one not

647
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,490
the biggest reason but the stronger year

648
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:32,070
of more united Europe not only reacting

649
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:36,299
to the word evolution but shaping a bit

650
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:37,980
more the world outside you're 28 people

651
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:43,020
fighting over the steering wheel where

652
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:46,440
does the EU busca the crossroads I very

653
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,389
much agree with with Eva example but it

654
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,510
just would presume that even looking for

655
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,510
Beijing your wine would win but this is

656
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,510
hahahaha

657
00:27:53,529 --> 00:28:02,720
this is a different story this is fully

658
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,879
right i mean i think Sundra was the one

659
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,029
who said before we are in recent years

660
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:09,980
very much inward looking for a number of

661
00:28:08,029 --> 00:28:13,789
reasons one crisis follow the others and

662
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:16,159
we we look inwards yeah we discussed as

663
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:18,799
Spain gained competitiveness compared to

664
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,440
Germany or to Italy whatsoever the point

665
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,340
is what is our position on the globe

666
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,779
yeah we Europeans together must be

667
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:29,899
competitive towards the u.s. towards

668
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:32,840
China towards India to whatever this is

669
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:35,299
what we are a bit missing currently yeah

670
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,000
and that the aim is not in economic

671
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:40,549
terms that everyone should become like

672
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,250
Germany the point is how can be

673
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:46,070
complementary and what we are doing and

674
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,559
what we are good at and then join forces

675
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:53,689
on the global see this is a bit that I

676
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:56,690
want to open the debate in Europe it's I

677
00:28:53,690 --> 00:29:00,649
think clearly in the European interest

678
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:02,480
that the UK stays but in my view is also

679
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:06,590
in the UK interest to stay but that's

680
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,909
not up to me to decide yeah but no but I

681
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,039
mean it's very difficult if you simply

682
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:12,830
look at the map how could one assume

683
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:15,440
that the channel is larger than the

684
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:17,750
Atlantic so it's for me it's in the

685
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,970
European interest that they stay but but

686
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:24,590
let's see the car to come to a

687
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,220
conclusion of the European integration

688
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,959
for me that is the euro area yeah we

689
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,690
have to integrate more these are the

690
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,940
words completing banking Union physical

691
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:38,600
union and parallel with a monetary union

692
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:40,549
true economic Union this is the inner

693
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,158
core of integration which is an open

694
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:45,200
club yeah the Baltics have shown if you

695
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:49,190
know willing and able to join it's both

696
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,350
willing and able you can join and this

697
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:54,289
is what we have to pursue of others

698
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:56,350
don't want to join that's fine but they

699
00:29:54,289 --> 00:29:59,600
cannot stop the train of the euro area

700
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:02,480
moving ahead but if you're part of this

701
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,719
inner circle you have specific rights

702
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,050
but also specific duties yeah that goes

703
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,300
on economic issues it goes up to values

704
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:14,270
and it goes up to the refugee crisis the

705
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:17,270
euro area is more than than the monetary

706
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:22,430
project so let me say this here and even

707
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:24,050
knows what I mean just what crystal ball

708
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,330
glazing is always difficult and there

709
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:28,490
are so many unknown unknowns you know in

710
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:29,750
the next 18 months when the brexit

711
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,520
referendum will take place and that's

712
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:34,250
obviously what I'm mostly focused on but

713
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,530
clearly stabilizing the euro zone area

714
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:38,180
is extremely important somebody

715
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,530
mentioned Switzerland I mean Switzerland

716
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:41,440
could be heading for a train crash in

717
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:44,000
its relationship with European Union in

718
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,440
2017 the bilateral treaties of

719
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,880
Switzerland will all be abrogated unless

720
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,550
they've sorted out there referendum

721
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,600
results on freedom of movement that you

722
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,220
know this that you know will there be

723
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,540
another I mean Portugal had an election

724
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,060
recently which we almost had a

725
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:58,010
government which was anti-nato anti-euro

726
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:59,480
and what have you or part of it within

727
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,520
the government so there are lots of

728
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,890
unknown unknowns I'm cautiously

729
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,629
optimistic that somehow the EU will

730
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:08,450
muddle through and that somehow Brits

731
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:11,510
will vote by a smallish majority to stay

732
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,280
in but I'm not very optimistic I will

733
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,620
certainly making a positive case in the

734
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,350
practical advantage to the citizen from

735
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,570
you know the end of roaming charges free

736
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:21,740
health care when you travel abroad you

737
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:23,450
know these are the things which people

738
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,920
resonate with you know they understand

739
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,500
in their hands not talking about just

740
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,420
acts as a single market or you know euro

741
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,400
caucusing being prevented in the City of

742
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,230
London this is a interest of the

743
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,570
economic and political elite but not to

744
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,130
the man or woman at the doorstep things

745
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,129
like you know freedom of moon for

746
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:42,620
students and Erasmus environmental

747
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,870
issues horizon 2020 which is of interest

748
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,340
to me as a medical doctor that Britain

749
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,810
does very well in terms of science the

750
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,520
medical research funding from the

751
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,580
European Union and that's best done at

752
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,580
super national level the Ebola fever in

753
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,110
West Africa was largely ring-fenced in

754
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,060
terms of that border was well controlled

755
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:00,169
and tens with people coming in anywhere

756
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,149
into the European Union and being

757
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,010
isolated and treated rapidly those

758
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:06,440
practical examples I are we trying to

759
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,290
sell the doorstep and I'm hoping that

760
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,240
people will resonate with them the there

761
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,409
will be some scaremongering in terms of

762
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,840
you know potential job losses

763
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:17,080
disinvestment maybe Chinese investments

764
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,080
you know

765
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,080
No

766
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,060
you know
