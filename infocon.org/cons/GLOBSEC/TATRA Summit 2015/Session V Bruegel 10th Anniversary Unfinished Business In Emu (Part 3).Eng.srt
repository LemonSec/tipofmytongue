1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,540
they really touch on uncertain symptoms

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:10,920
which we don't address we do that at our

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,759
own peril and it's very disconcerting to

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,990
see that although economics is not a

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,449
perfect science like the natural

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,189
sciences but there are certain laws or

7
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:23,100
principles that if you really go smack

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,730
against them what do you expect and and

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,859
we ignored these for political reasons

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,349
now one would say but Bruegel is not a

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,710
political thing taxes it's just a thing

12
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,780
thing and they and they don't go that's

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,680
not the it's not their remit it's our

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:45,750
remit now to get that political will in

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:51,539
order to achieve the better economy and

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:55,469
more social caring society European

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,870
society it's our it's our job from the

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,500
political so which comes back to your

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,718
question and our electorate wants to see

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,570
what's what's behind what what are we

21
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,479
going to get back so it's not a yes or

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,059
no giving up you know nobody gives up

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,280
freedoms or sovereignty just in a

24
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,380
welcome you know you want to know what

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,479
you're going to obtain and you reason it

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,449
out it is better then you're ready to

27
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,700
give up so it's a question of degree now

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,320
i'm just being told we have now four

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,850
more minutes which is probably the

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,439
moment when i open this up to the

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,408
audience if you want to ask a question

32
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,619
please raise your hand and make it a

33
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,329
question keep it short and say whom

34
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,130
you're addressing the question too

35
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,929
because we probably don't have time to

36
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:46,679
have everybody answer every single

37
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:49,829
question the gentleman over there i'm

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,040
josh from from Bruegel and i have a

39
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,720
question to vice president on broski

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,939
which is related to the point raised by

41
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,360
ministers cocoon and also can drop off

42
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,939
about this asymmetric adjustment within

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,710
the eurozone if i look at the European

44
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,630
semester recommendations

45
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:11,100
in the last three years in 12 13 and 14

46
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:13,740
then there was a recommendation for the

47
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:17,310
euro area that the more symmetric

48
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,450
adjustment would be desirable but this

49
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,040
recommendation is missing from this year

50
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,649
the European semester recommendation

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,840
gave for the euro area so my question is

52
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,880
that first of all do you think that a

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,500
more symmetric adjustment would be more

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:36,299
desirable and the second question if so

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,489
then why this recommendation has not

56
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,890
been made in the context of the European

57
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:48,920
semester this year thank you okay thank

58
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:53,760
you for this question so several points

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:58,820
here first it's something which we

60
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,440
outlined also in our communication on

61
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:04,519
completing the e muon a follow of a five

62
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,180
presidents report that we intend to give

63
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:14,670
euro-area recommendations more prominent

64
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:17,850
stance also advancing them on in time so

65
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:24,179
that the euro area recommendations can

66
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:26,340
then be reflected also in country

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:32,810
specific recommendations to the euro

68
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,810
area member states that is the first

69
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:47,549
observation second on this why it's not

70
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:50,970
done so far because we will only publish

71
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:53,900
annual growth survey later this month

72
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:57,209
and with this will start the new

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:01,640
European semester will be able to use

74
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:05,940
this new approach but then when

75
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,459
discussing euro area fiscal stance or

76
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,060
euro area depth developments for the

77
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:16,140
for example it's important to our other

78
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,100
line that it's not meant to invalidate

79
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,770
or undermine stability and growth pact

80
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,360
member states still held to comply with

81
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:28,200
the stability and growth pact it's part

82
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:32,070
of a treaty so it's more like analytical

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,500
tool to see what policy directions we

84
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,650
should be taking within the stability

85
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,020
and respect that's that's important

86
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:42,239
clarification and then on the symmetry

87
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,560
of symmetry also if we look for example

88
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,570
at macroeconomic imbalances procedure

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,850
it's also symmetric for example large

90
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,219
and sustained current account surpluses

91
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:55,320
are also considered the macroeconomic

92
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,980
imbalances that's one one of the reason

93
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:03,330
why we also were doing in this review to

94
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:05,190
Germany and also recommending them to

95
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:10,260
stimulate the demand side of the economy

96
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,850
to stimulate the investment in order not

97
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,510
to have such a large and such a

98
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,640
sustained current account surplus thank

99
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:20,370
you i think contra wanted to jump in on

100
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,950
this one yeah i just wanted to say two

101
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:26,820
words on on the on the fiscal issue i

102
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,070
think first of all this notion that we

103
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,560
are ready as a union to sustain

104
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,690
transfers cross-border i think is is

105
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,030
probably as you also said mr. shelling i

106
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,150
think is probably wrong i think

107
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,940
ultimately the political support will

108
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,460
not be there and and this will will

109
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,490
cause more difficulties then then it

110
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,090
solves now having said this I do think

111
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:52,830
that fiscal policy is of course national

112
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,390
fiscal policy will have to play a role

113
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:59,390
and we'll have to be more binding lee

114
00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:03,690
coordinated and and i think we need a

115
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:06,210
binding and a symmetric way of of code

116
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:10,140
and coordinating that fiscal policy now

117
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,870
of course when when you say this the

118
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,180
first thing I'm worried about is that

119
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,980
the Commission sort of has started to

120
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,500
become a bit lecture with

121
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,470
perhaps a bit too legs were in some

122
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,240
cases with the interpretation of rules

123
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,290
for countries that have very high debt

124
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,880
levels but at the same time of course

125
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,070
what we will need is we will need also

126
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,850
some form of a binding recommendation

127
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:40,750
that for example Germany should spend

128
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:44,800
another 20 billion also or raise raises

129
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,570
deficit to boost investment investment

130
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,250
in Germany to get this this sort of

131
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,510
symmetric adjustment and so in the more

132
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,970
at the moment I have the feeling that

133
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,820
there's so much non-compliance on all

134
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,370
sides that the trust to to move forward

135
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,190
the next step is actually is actually

136
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:03,700
much less they are now than it was was a

137
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:06,130
few years ago actually you're the

138
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,800
beginning of your intervention just now

139
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,810
a sexist very nicely to the question I

140
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,030
posed in the beginning about the fiscal

141
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,920
transfer transfers that we need would be

142
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:18,190
great if we can maybe get the results up

143
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:21,280
again from what I saw from what was up

144
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,870
earlier it seems like mr. calamy you

145
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,840
have to do a little bit more convincing

146
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,150
at home here because the unemployment

147
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,840
front is coming in at a mere thirteen

148
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:34,419
percent and I don't know to the

149
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,890
Commission it seems like these limited

150
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,510
financial incentives which was once

151
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,219
known as the fiscal capacity or

152
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,740
contractual arrangements are quite

153
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,300
popular here so maybe we'll see some

154
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,300
work on that in the near future and
