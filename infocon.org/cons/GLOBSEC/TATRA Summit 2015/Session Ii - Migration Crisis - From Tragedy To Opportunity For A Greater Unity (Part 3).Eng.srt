1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,730
well or deal with which either conflicts

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:13,469
or at least indifference and

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,590
indifference in European history was

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,500
always wrote to hell yeah so very let's

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,930
be more active and live and act with

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,810
people for solidarity with those in need

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,269
and distinction between refugees and

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,179
migrants economic migrants is the

9
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,610
primary departure level and then of

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,850
course don't forget that there are

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,829
causes in the middle east of this inflow

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:43,200
into Europe over which we have a limited

13
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:45,420
traction and but we have more more

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,760
capacity to deal with this than 50 years

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,559
ago yeah Mary CUNY me finland i know

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,620
it's it's not the main subject of the

17
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,399
day but what on earth is going on how

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,190
can you be having such a breakdown about

19
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,250
migrants when there are so few actually

20
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,320
i leave nowadays in perris the oecd so

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,479
i'm not so well aware of all the details

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,279
what is happening in infant but i just

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,100
want to comment the discussion and their

24
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,900
questions earlier so if we really want

25
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,720
to kind of get creeped of this refugee

26
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,210
crisis the only sustainable solution is

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,729
a global one a lot of measures are

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,759
needed are beginning from solving the

29
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,429
crisis in a and conflict in syria and we

30
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,270
have to be able to help the countries

31
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,610
from which people are living in to

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,590
develop themselves so development

33
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,090
assistance cut off these basic things we

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:45,180
have to make sure that we don't forget

35
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:48,570
those measures either soap and also the

36
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,689
burden sharing in in that sense also the

37
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:55,258
global responsibility from all the

38
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:57,960
countries part is needed but when it

39
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,990
comes to to Finland I I think that it

40
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,719
has been a maybe a little bit of

41
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,658
surprise that people also want to come

42
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,598
to Finland to a cold rather dark country

43
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,770
so i think in Finland we really should

44
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:17,640
be happy of that but to be honest there

45
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:21,380
I think there have arrived much more

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:24,929
refugees dependent compared to earlier

47
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:30,000
years and it really tells us how are

48
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,920
acute and bigger this crisis is but also

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,210
I think and it's my personal opinion

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,239
Finn and should bear its share too in

51
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,390
the global context and and also in the

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,210
European one thank you for that while

53
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,079
we've been talking the audience has been

54
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,510
voting and you are very divided should

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,790
you member states be able to refuse to

56
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,859
take in their share of refugees has

57
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,679
determined by an agree you formula for

58
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,870
relocation yes they should be able to

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,810
refuse say fifty four percent of the

60
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,100
audience no they shouldn't say forty six

61
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:11,580
percent so almost evenly divided but

62
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:14,160
clearly that sort of and then the

63
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,440
question should religion and or

64
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,870
ethnicity play any role in determining

65
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,870
which refugees are you member states

66
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:24,780
except that's a clearer vote seventy

67
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,990
percent say no but thirty percent say

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:30,090
yes so thank you for that thank you for

69
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,980
your for being honest and expressing

70
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,430
your views I want to thank all of our

71
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,320
panelists for their answers today and I

72
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,180
think it's been an enlightening session

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,440
but it certainly won't be the last on

74
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,440
this subject thank you very much
