infrastructure is that the right webs

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:20,910
got me in the world perhaps and I'm

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,750
Mathias but to to get our discussion

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,120
investment in Slovakia thank you I'm

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,519
good morning to everybody I hope you'll

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,239
have another good day fruto de of

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,890
discussions of the tougher summit I

15
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,739
think the topic of this panel is very

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,300
important and actually very very much in

17
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,070
line with what are the priorities for

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,038
for Europe but also for the smaller

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,910
government as president who was speaking

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,750
I was kind of going in my mind through

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,608
some reason in my in my experience in

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,010
the state sector and as you know i was

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,740
before in the ministry of finance and we

24
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,450
were also kind of silently talking with

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,259
too much stefan because we spend many

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:19,200
hours and nights and days during the esc

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:22,409
WG and euro group meetings yeah i miss

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,210
you as well too many hours together then

29
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:29,509
get get used to it becomes a family so

30
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,130
anyway I was thinking about year 2012

31
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:35,299
everything is falling apart grease is

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,030
bad Spain is coming on board cyprus and

33
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:41,280
you know with President very well and in

34
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,890
so lucky also the new government comes

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,350
to comes to power the immediate goal is

36
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,659
to somehow stabilize the public finance

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,539
and get the house in order because this

38
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,119
is really what we have to do otherwise

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:57,450
the whole eurozone may collapse and the

40
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,630
country's inside as well so that's one

41
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:03,329
kind of snapshot for us this was a

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:06,149
challenge to to put public finances in

43
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,310
order to get deficit under three percent

44
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,270
to stabilize the situation is the public

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,090
debt and to

46
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,930
exit excessive deficit procedure where

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:21,090
we went into at that point now another

48
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:23,670
snapshot for me is September 2014 we're

49
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:28,070
just talking that it was a meeting of

50
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:30,630
the echofon in Milano in Italy and

51
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:34,859
actually one of the main promoters of

52
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:36,810
the austerity Minister Minister friends

53
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,150
of Germany I was quite surprised when he

54
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,130
said that look guys we have been

55
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:45,210
successful we stabilized our public

56
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:48,090
finance we did a lot Greece is in much

57
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:50,310
better shape Spain's doing very well

58
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,320
which we call me start growing but we

59
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,850
have what we have to do now is to shift

60
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,700
our focus from austerity or for focus on

61
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,190
public finance or two how do we promote

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,489
economic growth because austerity was

63
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,230
not the goal for its own purpose the

64
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,050
measures which we had to adopt to put

65
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,929
public finance in order were only de

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:15,780
facto the necessary measures to put

67
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,240
situation in this in such shape that we

68
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,980
could focus on economic growth and I

69
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,140
think this was the kind of first element

70
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,030
of what we became the investment plan

71
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,519
for Europe and then was translated into

72
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,220
the UN care package and eventually led

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,910
to EFS I and all those activities that

74
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,010
present her described so for me this was

75
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,200
a very interesting kind of evolution of

76
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,380
thinking at the top of the European

77
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,630
level and I was very happy to be part of

78
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,220
these individually and also is my shift

79
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,019
from Ministry of Finance to the in-store

80
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,440
economy where I focus much more in on

81
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:52,200
economic growth I'm happy that we got in

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,510
terms of the European situation to this

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,429
to this stage of course doesn't mean

84
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,290
that focusing on economic growth

85
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,690
decreases the importance of the of

86
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,370
public finance of making sure that our

87
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,730
house is in order in terms of keeping

88
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,950
the basic rules of fiscal management and

89
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,040
public finance management now what it

90
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:13,079
means for slovakia I can say very

91
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,709
proudly that River as well as we were

92
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:21,450
actually in the front run of of some of

93
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,760
these developments already back in 2013

94
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,240
when we were very much in the

95
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,820
consolidation austerity mood we were

96
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,410
thinking okay how do we actually plan

97
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,860
some seats for future economic growth

98
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,350
because we did feel the what was

99
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,860
described as the gap in investments and

100
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,750
innovations and we came up with the idea

101
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,410
of so-called slovakian has been holding

102
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:52,650
which is in a way a national Slovak

103
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:55,320
solar incarnation of EFS I so the

104
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,890
government decided to put aside three

105
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,390
percent of the EU funds which are coming

106
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:04,169
to slovakia during the new programming

107
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:06,719
period 2014-2020 so around 500 million

108
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,330
euro into a special vehicle called

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,670
slogan Osman holding whose purpose is to

110
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,219
manage these funds but especially to

111
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,620
identify viable commercial bankable

112
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,610
projects and to attract a private

113
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,830
financing to to those projects so for us

114
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:27,000
this is a very interesting instrument

115
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,909
which can do what the FSI should do as

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,560
well it means to use public money to

117
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,890
spoke mainly in a smart way either it's

118
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,890
guarantees or so is sharing instruments

119
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:44,190
and so that we can mobilize more private

120
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:47,120
financing into into economy we are now

121
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:49,350
in the situation where we have analysed

122
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,260
opportunities and the needs in the salak

123
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,960
economy we have submitted to the FSI

124
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,730
around 40 projects there is a kind of

125
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,919
pipeline which has been created for the

126
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,650
European front of strategic investments

127
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:05,340
these 40 projects represent around 11

128
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:08,370
billion euro it shows that there is a

129
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,460
need for financing in Slovakia a need

130
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:15,540
for investments we have also launched

131
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:19,349
heavy modernization in innovations in

132
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,150
innovations program agenda through

133
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,680
through the governments of the Minister

134
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,229
of Finance which includes also support

135
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,710
for anything in particular for four

136
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:32,280
second start up start up companies so I

137
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,650
think the overall overall situation is

138
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,960
that so whatever is very much

139
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,789
in support of those activities that the

140
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,138
eib is doing we are also working closely

141
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:45,840
on on financing for the PPP highway

142
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,740
so-called ring road runs away kia are

143
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,560
seven before ring road also um i can say

144
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,229
that sake is going to contribute 400

145
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,630
million euro to the EFS I through

146
00:06:55,229 --> 00:07:00,539
co-financing of the projects which will

147
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,000
go to the EFS FSI FSI using the funds

148
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,820
from the State Development Bank and the

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,310
slogan has been holding that's very much

150
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,199
for introduction from my side okay thank

151
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:15,740
you thank you so much stuff and learn

152
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:18,030
the learner upset out very clearly the

153
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,810
investment challenges for Europe in

154
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,159
Germany is often accused of failing

155
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,780
firstly to invest in its own

156
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,630
infrastructure and a lack of investment

157
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,859
in its domestic market but also clearly

158
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,310
there you know there is this a wider

159
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,650
european challenge do you agree with

160
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,840
vernon Hoyas assessment and the younger

161
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,900
plan assessment of what the priorities

162
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,760
are the method that's going about the

163
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,530
way that these problems are being

164
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,300
addressed do you think that this is the

165
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:50,729
right solution for europe yeah Thank You

166
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,080
Simon and of course I could be very

167
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:57,330
preferred see I totally share van ohio's

168
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,150
view and hand on the floor to the next

169
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,960
to the next speaker but just to give you

170
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:06,120
a let's say more more comprehensive and

171
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,609
hopefully also more consistent picture

172
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,320
in the way of what are the main elements

173
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:14,490
that van ahora really stressed and

174
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,070
pointed out because it's always

175
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:18,539
important to have a narrative for Europe

176
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,449
and the narrative is not just one

177
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:24,830
element the narrative consists of many

178
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:27,240
of many elements it's and by the way

179
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,719
congratulating the initiative the

180
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,000
initiators of the Tetra summit for for

181
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,510
selecting the right headlines I looked

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,570
at the agenda of the last 22 days it's

183
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:43,110
about Europe really being at crossroads

184
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:47,070
and it's really about how to keep Europe

185
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,589
together and it's about the de

186
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,820
priorities for the incoming

187
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:53,839
presidencies where we have to address

188
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,740
the main challenges of today and and

189
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:02,070
tomorrow and and and Wasel already

190
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:05,850
mentioned some of the solutions to

191
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,860
address these challenges and I would

192
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,470
like to summarize from a German

193
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,769
perspective and that there are always

194
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:16,709
three elements it's a kind of tree or I

195
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:19,949
wouldn't call a troika but maybe 30 is

196
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:23,369
the more neutral name for that it is

197
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:25,800
what he mentioned as austerity I would

198
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,819
call it fiscal consolidation so we have

199
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,500
to go to go on with with that kind of

200
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:33,329
fiscal consolidation for the simple

201
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,850
reason that Europe has to be credible

202
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,800
and the debt levels the public debt

203
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,480
levels are much too high especially in

204
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,719
the year or so on with beyond ninety

205
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,730
percent of GDP so this is ongoing work I

206
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,180
would call it just to be credible to the

207
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:51,180
outside world and the second element is

208
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,719
it's about implementing structural

209
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:57,779
reforms and the third is about how to

210
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,480
foster viable investments and how to

211
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:03,990
bring private and restless investments

212
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,050
in and there is one underlying let's say

213
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,459
principle for all these three elements

214
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,740
consolidation structural reforms and

215
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:14,550
viable projects and this is what

216
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,430
sometimes we both suffered a lot from in

217
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,250
many many European discussions it's not

218
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,829
about announcing something it is exactly

219
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,440
what vana who I said it's let's just do

220
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:28,439
it let's implement structural reforms

221
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,529
let's really go on with growth friendly

222
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,779
consolidation and reds really bring

223
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,850
private investors in because it's true

224
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:38,610
what was that the public funds and

225
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,439
future times will never be enough so

226
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:43,889
it's again not about announcing not

227
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:48,810
about discussions it's about just let us

228
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:51,630
do something to bring Europe forward and

229
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,569
and that is why i would like to

230
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,790
illustrate that was part of your

231
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:59,639
question what what what germany is doing

232
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:02,040
and how Germany can contribute to the

233
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,769
ongoing process and then our

234
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,769
mentioned a lot of pillars let me maybe

235
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,320
add four more pillars and there is a lot

236
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,720
of overlap between all the pillows but

237
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,110
the first one is i guess that countries

238
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:21,360
in europe and Wasel has given a lot of

239
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:23,790
good examples from the Slovakian point

240
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,240
of view that the countries have to do

241
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:30,380
their homework it is true that Germany

242
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:37,259
has to invest more my Minister announced

243
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:41,430
another six eight billion euros 2016

244
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:45,810
2018 and by the way we just had our

245
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:48,560
draft budget for 2016 in in parliament

246
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,300
and of course we have to invest a lot in

247
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,219
human resources and refugees how to

248
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,949
train people how to better integrate

249
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,079
people in the German labour market that

250
00:11:55,949 --> 00:12:01,258
will be quite costly from a short from a

251
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,508
point of view of today but in the medium

252
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,720
to long run I guess it will be an

253
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:10,769
investment in not just our economy but

254
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,740
also in the in the European economy so

255
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:16,220
it's on the national basis people have

256
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,110
to do their their homework to promote

257
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,720
projects and end investments and the

258
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,540
second pillar is that of course all our

259
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,990
countries are not living on an island a

260
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,269
German is very much aware of that we

261
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,579
have to better cooperate and coordinate

262
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,670
our projects within Europe that is why

263
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:38,609
we push our KfW which is our promotional

264
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:41,729
back to better cooperate with many many

265
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,160
other promotional banks in Europe and in

266
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,170
the eurozone so they have global loans

267
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,389
and other arrangements in the area of

268
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,310
three billion euros in place and I guess

269
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:52,529
we have to increase that to better

270
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,599
coordinate our projects within Europe

271
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:58,639
this is the second the third pillar is

272
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:02,430
of course how can we contribute to DFC

273
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,620
our expectation is again through KfW

274
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,519
that will contribute in the area of

275
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,519
eight billion euros to 20 FC projects

276
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,640
through various instruments and the

277
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:17,190
first bands had been launched in

278
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,370
in September so this is a clear

279
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:23,940
commitment by Germany and determine

280
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:26,670
government and decay of W to support the

281
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:29,130
EOB to cooperate with the ER be and to

282
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,469
make DSC a success and then there is a

283
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,240
fourth pillar and in my view this is the

284
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,700
most important pillar it's very much

285
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,950
again in line with what varner jolla

286
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,860
said if the three first pillars are

287
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,690
let's say quantitative palace the fourth

288
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,810
pillar must be the qualitative pillar

289
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:48,570
how to how to improve the investment

290
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,760
climate in europe how to convince asian

291
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:53,160
investors to come to Europe are to come

292
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,380
back to Europe and to invest money in

293
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,750
Europe this is the crucial this is the

294
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:01,650
crucial point so this has a lot of to do

295
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:04,650
with deregulation fighting bureaucracy

296
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:07,079
and and and red tape and sometimes I

297
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,390
have to impression that the the

298
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,640
Commission has started in the rector in

299
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:13,680
the right direction last year and maybe

300
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,720
I don't know mr. Timmerman's who is in

301
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,989
charge of deregulation for example I

302
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,610
guess is very much also busy with with

303
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,890
refugees over not shocked that the

304
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,320
Commission will continue with that

305
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,390
fourth pillar to really build the

306
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,580
narrative and to convince outside

307
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,760
investors to come to Europe and to

308
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,820
invest in Europe to foster growth and

309
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,600
enter create jobs thank you very much

310
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:43,640
for that neatly the choice of leads on

311
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:48,210
to go and buy now as an investor the

312
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,040
burner hoy was very clear that well

313
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,000
first he was he acknowledged that the

314
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,569
world is currently a washed with

315
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,220
liquidity so there's no shortage of

316
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,630
money in the world looking for

317
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,510
investment opportunities he was very

318
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,070
clear that the IB is not crowding out

319
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,750
investment its crowding in I was

320
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,000
interested as investor do you feel

321
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:07,860
crowded out or crowded in by what you've

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,190
sort of what you've been hearing this

323
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:15,540
morning thanks for the question I've

324
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:16,800
always have to remind myself that I'm

325
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,300
not sitting on the government side

326
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,189
because I've been there done that got

327
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:25,939
the lousy t-shirt but now I have to

328
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:25,940
represent private private sector Medina

329
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:34,080
so yes I was very pleased to hear

330
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:37,890
president Hoyer speech because I think

331
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,470
it has underlined again that the UK plan

332
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:43,140
has the right starting point the right

333
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:45,480
UK plan comes from the recognition that

334
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,970
the real problem is not the lack of

335
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,910
money in the market the real problem is

336
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:52,710
the lack of projects I think the

337
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,790
fundamental recognition in the in the

338
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,750
approach of the younger plan is that

339
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,540
governments cannot take on more debt

340
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,520
they actually should reduce all the debt

341
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,520
that was a mast as a result of this

342
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,199
crisis but on the other hand as Larry

343
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,750
Summers put it in us in an article

344
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,520
recently there is actually there is one

345
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,710
territory where there is free lunch

346
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,600
which is public in good quality public

347
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,010
infrastructure investment because it

348
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,570
generates short-term and long-term

349
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:23,900
growth increases competitiveness if you

350
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,850
can finance it from other than public

351
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,010
public indebtedness and that's why it's

352
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,720
a good combination in the UK plan to say

353
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,110
we put in a little public money to

354
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,260
generate much more private investment so

355
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,260
it is the right approach and on the

356
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,510
other hand it's also trying to reflect a

357
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:47,460
very substantial problem of most of the

358
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:49,860
European countries that are public

359
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:52,440
retirement systems or private savings

360
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,020
based retirement systems and our pub our

361
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,280
private has saving systems are

362
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:01,710
unsustainable at the current levels of

363
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,569
interest rate simply there is no real

364
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,329
rate of return for those insurance

365
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:09,600
companies and pension fund managers to

366
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,310
keep up the viability of their

367
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,948
retirement system so they need to find

368
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:17,760
projects where there is some kind of a

369
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:19,679
real rate of return there is some IRR so

370
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,199
there's an enormous pressure of private

371
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:27,030
money trying to find projects in Europe

372
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,190
bankable viable projects they would be

373
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,950
ready to finance this project at

374
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:34,140
historically low levels of interest

375
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:37,920
rates because they can't buy more

376
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,640
government debt so matching the

377
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,710
supply of money with the need for more

378
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,450
infrastructure investment is the perfect

379
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:48,510
match the question is and that's where

380
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:52,080
the eib is coming in they have to be the

381
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:56,100
matchmaker and that's their role not so

382
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,449
much give providing new more money

383
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,459
because there's a lot of money on the

384
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,550
ground but the best use of the ER miss

385
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,560
money is to help governments produce

386
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:08,370
projects because there is a lack of

387
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,100
viable projects in Europe and especially

388
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,560
I think eib has a specific role as the

389
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:17,000
president has said it is to find those

390
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:21,000
risk elements that may hold back

391
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,450
investors from from investing but if you

392
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,620
talk about the lack of projects I think

393
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,770
generating projects is in the hand of

394
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,290
the national government the eib cannot

395
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,030
produce projects private investors can

396
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:38,940
only come if the project is there and

397
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:40,980
there are some bureaucratic problems or

398
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,990
actually counter effective regulations

399
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,420
these days and I'm watching with great

400
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,880
interest Timmerman's project of the

401
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:51,720
third pillar of the younger plan just to

402
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:55,170
give you one example while we say we

403
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,290
need more investment PPP style with

404
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:00,660
private money supporting public purpose

405
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:04,520
for example the recent changes in the

406
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:07,710
eurostat regulations which have

407
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,510
practically made almost all PPP projects

408
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,350
to be part of the government balance

409
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:15,780
sheet in terms of that is completely

410
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,100
counterproductive v we are at meridian

411
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,620
we are investing all around the world

412
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,020
North America Europe including Turkey

413
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,540
and Africa and what we see in Europe

414
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,870
many governments are actually holding

415
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:32,790
back starting projects for example in

416
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:34,590
Scotland Belgium Spain because they are

417
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,200
afraid that those projects which were

418
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,850
previously not part of their government

419
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,460
that because they have a true PPP

420
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:45,030
project that the risk was really on the

421
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,550
private side are now classified by the

422
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,600
rust rot or questionable or clearly

423
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:52,000
classified as government

424
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,149
there is one other not even more tricky

425
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,020
issue which is a bit more slippery than

426
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:02,200
this one when the UK plan was started

427
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:04,780
there was an initiative to say those

428
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,570
projects which are approved by an all

429
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,750
european grand jury to say these are

430
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:13,000
really of european in importance and can

431
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,429
stimulate growth those could the

432
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,750
government costs attached to those

433
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:21,299
projects over time could be somehow

434
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,539
exempted from the Maastricht criteria

435
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:26,980
this idea was thrown out very quickly

436
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,690
because certain governments probably

437
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,270
didn't like the idea of sort it as it's

438
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,179
a very easy way to to loosen up the

439
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,830
rules but on the other hand you would

440
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,740
get an incredible supply of quality

441
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:41,408
projects if you got these rules because

442
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,049
many governments in Europe are suffering

443
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:46,090
with obviously with the Maastricht

444
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:48,039
criteria so they are trying to save on

445
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,189
even on the quality infrastructure

446
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:54,190
projects these are two regularity like

447
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,200
regulatory issues that are causing the

448
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,350
bottleneck of projects where the money

449
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,340
is there and trying to find its place

450
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,780
very interesting thanks when we come

451
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,370
back to that point I think that's worth

452
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:09,850
exploring padova so I want to ask my

453
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:12,580
tires were talk the burner again was

454
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:14,110
just talking about the e i beez role in

455
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,629
this world awash with liquidity is

456
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,580
addressing market failures but i'm a bit

457
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:23,409
puzzled by this idea of market failure

458
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:28,330
given that the cost of capital is so

459
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:30,730
cheap is it just that the markets simply

460
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,770
incapable of producing projects that

461
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:34,600
without the ip's help that can create a

462
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,220
return or is it that they could you

463
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,658
can't recover ments can't create

464
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,799
projects at a price they would like is

465
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:40,240
it just it's simply a question of

466
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,020
pricing or the fact that projects just

467
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,630
can't be done at all with private money

468
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,940
thank you sign I think the choreography

469
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,710
is quite interesting here because I mean

470
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,950
renault jolla set the tone and actually

471
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:56,830
gave the vision then public and private

472
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,559
sector tools and the people who actually

473
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,990
on the ground we need to listen I think

474
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,100
listening is actually what we are what

475
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,360
we are about to do

476
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:09,990
our bank is a bank isn't such actually

477
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,320
has limited means in creating projects

478
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:17,770
but these means we need to we need to

479
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,840
use them as a catalyst to address the

480
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:24,160
issues that were raised by all previous

481
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,490
speakers and that is I think changing

482
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:30,730
the investment environment changing the

483
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:33,280
investment psychology if you want is a

484
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,679
very important message and we need to

485
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,539
not only actually address we did address

486
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,370
the liquidity issues in the past we now

487
00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:43,929
need to address totally different set of

488
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:45,158
issues that is of course I mean last

489
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:47,860
start was um it was addressing the

490
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,840
programs of where are the projects and

491
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:53,620
was desperate out revenue to have

492
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,389
explosions now it is a question of

493
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,580
confidence and investors confidence and

494
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,919
this is not only you ask who are the

495
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,139
investors I mean we have different sorts

496
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,360
of investors and states and member

497
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,070
states are of course a very important

498
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,408
set of investors they invest in their

499
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,539
own capital stock they actually go out

500
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:13,570
and want to have infrastructure that

501
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:15,549
brings the country forward so they need

502
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:18,789
to see an interest in doing this type of

503
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:22,030
investments they need to see return and

504
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:23,770
this return is actually one of the most

505
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,950
striking criteria that here we will look

506
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,690
at if we finance a project so we will

507
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,780
look at the economic rates of return of

508
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:33,870
this type of investments now do we need

509
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:37,960
to do that in particular countries only

510
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:40,270
no I fully agree mr. Stefan that they're

511
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,880
big economies also have their roles to

512
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,889
play in terms of investment climate in

513
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,900
terms of leading the way in terms of

514
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,190
creating examples and choosing also the

515
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:54,299
right projects we have seen

516
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:56,770
infrastructure transport investments in

517
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,658
highly rated cover countries in Europe

518
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:01,960
that have economic rates of return of

519
00:23:58,659 --> 00:24:04,900
thirty percent and above so that is

520
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,840
actually a very good indicator that the

521
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,400
public side should mobilize its energy

522
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:14,050
and potentially it's money to actually

523
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:19,820
realize these infrastructures now

524
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:22,040
if we had beea often faced was the

525
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,409
question on an off-balance sheet are

526
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:32,139
these actually drive us to do

527
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:35,390
infrastructure or not and I think again

528
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:37,730
we sometimes I had a very positive view

529
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:40,130
on let's say the risk transfer which is

530
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,290
intrinsic for instance in the German PvP

531
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,420
models that would allow why would have

532
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:47,920
have allowed actually in the past and

533
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:51,290
off-balance sheet treatment but for

534
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:53,360
reasons that are political reasons in

535
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,250
this country they were choose not to be

536
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,800
put outside the balance sheet but they

537
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,020
stay on the balance sheet now they may

538
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,680
enjoy over for using PPP models is value

539
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:06,620
of time and quality of execution so what

540
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,000
we are doing is actually going out talk

541
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:11,929
to people listen to people try to

542
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,960
identify projects that are useful they'd

543
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,060
have high economic rates of returns and

544
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,310
where we can make a difference in terms

545
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,100
of creating conference that these

546
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,780
projects will find a market because they

547
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,169
have the backing of EU institution

548
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,340
because we have an exchange on

549
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,740
methodologies of how to evaluate how to

550
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,709
procure because we have a dialogue and

551
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,410
we are fulfilling our advisory role

552
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:39,380
which is coming on top of our lending

553
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,450
and blending role afterwards we need to

554
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,370
think about how can we maximize what we

555
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:47,330
are doing so we think about financial

556
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:49,159
instruments with FC we are entering a

557
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:53,710
phase where financial instruments is

558
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:56,930
getting a new dimension this is not like

559
00:25:53,710 --> 00:26:00,880
we do not do in patchwork we really need

560
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:04,280
to address key issues in terms of

561
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,160
drivers to invest of course I mean we

562
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,560
will not or rarely find a project where

563
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,090
B is the only driver to say okay we do

564
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,669
it we participate and that's why the

565
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,800
project is going to come up but we need

566
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,350
to be in constant discussions with all

567
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:22,879
sides to actually convince people that

568
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:26,270
yes this is good to do our role is then

569
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,559
to take it's very difficult let say four

570
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,870
people on the ground to strike the

571
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:31,490
right balance between crowding out and

572
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,620
risk taking and making this particular

573
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,169
difference so that is what we are right

574
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:39,158
now busy with is to try to find this

575
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:41,990
balance to make people actually met say

576
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:43,669
willing to invest willing to procure to

577
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,870
actually create this pipeline of

578
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:50,419
projects and of course afterwards to

579
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,629
finance it so we somehow need to need to

580
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:56,870
play a catalyst role but not too heavy

581
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:58,908
actually in order to not crowd other

582
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:00,678
investors are and these investors are of

583
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,059
course when we talk about crowding out

584
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:03,740
we're talking about people who would do

585
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:05,658
the same thing that us this financial

586
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,019
investors who actually want to go into

587
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:10,700
the dead structures so I think a very

588
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:13,249
important thing is that and the message

589
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,919
was on is that this bank is currently

590
00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:18,529
sort of reinventing itself taking up the

591
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,470
challenge means that we that we actually

592
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:23,539
change also our business model I think

593
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,759
the numbers that were no higher cited

594
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:28,309
were quite important because we did

595
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,649
high-risk and transactions in the order

596
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:33,470
of up to 5 billion per year we are going

597
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:36,350
to do four times more so that is that is

598
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,690
the signal where where we actually go

599
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:40,100
into a change mode and that is very

600
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:42,379
important if you can only do it if we

601
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,658
continue to have this dialogue with all

602
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:46,158
involved sides it's particularly nice

603
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:48,379
actually to have fuzz in here and I

604
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,070
think the experience is that Slovakia

605
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:54,219
has produced absolutely outstanding

606
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,869
because they are at the forefront of

607
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:00,159
using the idea of financial instruments

608
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:03,320
in order to try to create an investment

609
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,509
environment and I think at least for the

610
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,369
photo for the small piece of the way

611
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:10,129
that we could accompany so they can in

612
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:11,949
this particular rod he considers to be

613
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:14,899
an extremely successful way to do it

614
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:17,240
thank you well I wanted to come back to

615
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:21,080
a vassal actually because you know I I I

616
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,820
actually moderated a similar panel here

617
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,619
at the summit last year on this topic

618
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:31,610
pre the younger plan and pre fc's and

619
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:33,678
the very clear message then on that

620
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:35,418
panel was again the lack of projects but

621
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,019
they and it comes to the point that

622
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:40,920
Thomas Stefan was making that about

623
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:43,380
creating the right investment climate

624
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,360
and what people discussing arrows that

625
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,660
some of the real blockages were actually

626
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:53,520
two investment things like corruption

627
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:55,590
poor regulation week insolvency regimes

628
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,230
and legal systems or what you access to

629
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,929
justice for investors I mean I wonder

630
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:03,990
you know you've got these 40 projects

631
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:05,730
but what um but how you know what what

632
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,250
do you would you accept that those are

633
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,650
still big blockages is the I mean is the

634
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:12,420
eib and the younger plan really just

635
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,940
trying to subsidize poor governance is

636
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,460
that what is that the issue here and you

637
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,290
water the blockages to investment are

638
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,550
there still blockages in Slovakia for

639
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,590
example would you accept that those are

640
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:27,080
really where the real the real challenge

641
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:29,399
is like I agree and I think that the

642
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,800
Tamar Stefan put in the right way that

643
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,540
we have this kind of quantitative

644
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,000
elements which have to be put in place

645
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,670
it means there has to be basically the

646
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,230
the money channels either either through

647
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,580
national budgets or through National

648
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:43,100
Development Bank's or through

649
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,020
international development institutions

650
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:47,250
into the projects which are viable and

651
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,320
which would also encourage private

652
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,970
sector to participate but there has to

653
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,649
be the qualitative element which is

654
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,960
basically the investment climate which

655
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,850
has to become and it has to be conducive

656
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,880
enough for private investors to get

657
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:02,459
engaged as far as Slovakia is concerned

658
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,440
I of course I cannot say that we are in

659
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,380
and the ideal position I think it's kind

660
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,750
of marathon exercise where you go and

661
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,090
you improve you deregulate you decrease

662
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:15,090
the bureaucracy you get rid of the

663
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:17,159
corruption wherever it exists and it is

664
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:21,050
really a process which takes a long time

665
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,710
and takes efforts from all different

666
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,389
different parts of the state

667
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,400
administration instantly means to

668
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:29,130
economy not only Ministry of Finance

669
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,650
also construction permits and many

670
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:33,090
things of this type one thing which we

671
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,400
are introduced introducing so lakiya

672
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,159
which I believe will help in this

673
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,800
process is so-called regulatory impact

674
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,680
assessment so basically the government

675
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,639
approved a procedure where each

676
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,650
legislation which is going to be adopted

677
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,720
in Slovakia has to go through this

678
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,970
regulatory impact assessment actually to

679
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,290
be performed by the Minister of Economy

680
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,730
which means that we will be looking at

681
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,840
each legislation from the point of view

682
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,470
of its imp

683
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,120
or potential impact on entrepreneurial

684
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:02,190
environment business environment whether

685
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,860
it's positive or negative and I think

686
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,200
this will help us to kind of pre-screen

687
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,679
and filter legislation even before

688
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,930
before it is introduced and made made as

689
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:18,510
a long one thing which I want to mention

690
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:20,850
is that that the EFS I and the whole Pro

691
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,410
investment move which we are talking

692
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,510
about now in Europe and which is only

693
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:28,430
necessary for making Europe competitive

694
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:31,140
within global economy has to be also

695
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:35,220
supported by but i'll call cross-border

696
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:37,230
projects and i think one maybe materials

697
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,930
can crack me but one complaint I have

698
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:43,140
received so far from the eib people and

699
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:45,450
people engaged in the FSI is that there

700
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,640
are many national projects which is good

701
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:50,310
and this probably the base but there are

702
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,010
too few cross-border projects and we

703
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:55,710
denote we do need to strengthen the

704
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,120
European identity by this kind of

705
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,480
cross-border project whether it's in

706
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,719
energy area infrastructure transport or

707
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,160
or innovation area and we need to me had

708
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,390
actually very interesting discussion

709
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,980
yesterday during the lunch time with

710
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:13,980
ministers and also price at

711
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,550
representatives from Central Europe v 4

712
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,520
+ Austria talking about the fact that we

713
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:22,980
should find a way how how to bring

714
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,900
together the different elements of

715
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,730
innovation clusters even within Central

716
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:30,720
Europe whether it's in biotechnology

717
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:33,570
whether it's in IT or any other areas so

718
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,220
I think this is also a piece of of the

719
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,169
agenda where we need some kind of

720
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,060
encouragement from governments we need

721
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,100
to create a conducive environment for

722
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:43,530
private sector and we have to kind of

723
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,659
pull forces together I really wanted to

724
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:49,379
come on to this question of a transport

725
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:51,180
I think it's clearly crucial I'd like to

726
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,630
ask Thomas Stephanie you know what

727
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:57,240
really object what's going your what you

728
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:59,760
see happening at a European level to try

729
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,260
and foster a better cross-border

730
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,070
investment but before i come to you

731
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:06,870
about sir Matthias you could you briefly

732
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,860
tell us you know it within these

733
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,689
projects are looking at how much

734
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,820
cross-border l

735
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:17,780
there is in that I mean just put us in

736
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:22,040
the pressure for now the the the

737
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:24,530
European Union that actually has a a

738
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,180
cross-border road map at least for

739
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:28,850
transport and energy infrastructure and

740
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:33,140
that is the trans-european networks so

741
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:34,490
of course most of these let's say in the

742
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,010
energy sector most of the cross-border

743
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:38,840
rather than projects they are regulated

744
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:42,020
businesses so that is like gas or

745
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:45,919
electricity interconnectors now these

746
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:48,889
are by definition nationally based so

747
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,630
there is no particular incentive for off

748
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:52,490
in a lot of countries let's say there is

749
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,020
no particular incentive for such a

750
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,840
transmission transmission system

751
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:59,240
operator to actually invest into

752
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,909
cross-border projects that are maybe

753
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,100
more complicated and that it needs

754
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,400
require coordination with another two

755
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:10,219
years oh so complications are there and

756
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:15,470
the use of cross-border investments is

757
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:17,089
not necessarily equally equally arriving

758
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:18,770
at each side of the border so you might

759
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,720
have something an infrastructure that is

760
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,449
actually benefiting one country but the

761
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,389
cost of it would actually be split 50-50

762
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:28,460
so this these are the real problems that

763
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:32,299
we need to address and national

764
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,790
regulators will need to find a political

765
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,340
will to address these issues to

766
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:40,100
incentivize tears know what to do so or

767
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,770
to create river regulatory regimes that

768
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:44,509
are standalone for cross-border

769
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:46,670
investments in which particular case of

770
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:50,810
course EAB would be ready to step in and

771
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:54,590
and say we we will take regulatory risks

772
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:56,299
under FC and and try to support these

773
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:59,110
investments I was really hoping for a

774
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,610
number how many how many projects I

775
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,530
couldn't tell you you can t Tuesday and

776
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:08,750
a very small number or very large number

777
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:10,460
I mean on on it cross border is not

778
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,470
actually the stretch of infrastructure

779
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,200
crosses the border one needs to say I

780
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:18,189
mean cross border in transporting first

781
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,720
ranches it's defined as corridors so

782
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,490
everything that we do in the transport

783
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,189
sector is actually on these corridor

784
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:28,040
that is like an eligibility criteria for

785
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:30,230
so transport and most of the energy

786
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,050
projects that we do in transmission they

787
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:35,780
are part of the of the of the of the

788
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:37,970
larger scheme of trans-european networks

789
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,740
so in that sense you but I would have a

790
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,750
tendency to say a hundred percent is

791
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,850
actually on these costs border accesses

792
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,950
without actually having let site the

793
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:48,170
link that goes over the rhine over the

794
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,450
den you or or or whatever it is

795
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,710
sometimes also be do that but i mean in

796
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:55,160
that sense really it's a hundred percent

797
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:57,350
i c-cannot just just very very briefly

798
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,868
very briefly i just want to avoid the

799
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:02,150
the impression that FC is only there for

800
00:35:59,869 --> 00:36:04,580
infrastructure i mean when are we are

801
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:07,369
pointed it out we are talking about a

802
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:11,330
whole variety of sectors that we want to

803
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:13,610
invest in and and and spur spur private

804
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:15,410
investments and that is only that is not

805
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:17,300
only infrastructure that is of course

806
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,339
the energy sector is of course

807
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,580
innovation this is of course access to

808
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:24,470
finance whereas they means but it is

809
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,970
also industry so we also see balance

810
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:27,560
sheet constraints in industry

811
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:29,149
investments where ring-fenced

812
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,920
investments will be necessary power

813
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:32,960
generation things like that which is

814
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,310
also something that you will be able to

815
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,930
support throughout see but that was just

816
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:39,049
a little correction terms of image i

817
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:43,069
wanted to get yes guide could come back

818
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:44,780
to drama so what you see the europe

819
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,900
could be done at a european union level

820
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:50,240
usefully to encourage more cross-border

821
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,880
projects and I suppose partly I would

822
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,399
throw in banking Union as part of that

823
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,230
to what extent banking Union completing

824
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,330
that is an essential step in terms of

825
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,800
creating a cross-border investment

826
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,259
climate may be capital markets union

827
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,050
ship anyway what do you think Europe the

828
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,609
European Union can be doing to help at

829
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,790
that level create a better investment

830
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:13,670
climate yeah this is very important

831
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:17,330
question let me briefly introduce the

832
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:19,250
response by it by saying first on the FC

833
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,109
I think we discussed several times but

834
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:24,770
we all concluded that there should not

835
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:26,569
be geographical quota and the DFC so

836
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,480
whatever is viable and would bring

837
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:31,990
private investors in we should really

838
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,680
support especially of course a

839
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:37,319
cross-border projector very much

840
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,930
welcome and that is why I said on a

841
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,000
bilateral basis maybe again we have to

842
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:44,910
encourage our promotional banks to work

843
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,100
closely together because they are quite

844
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,220
close to the real business they can

845
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:55,020
maybe also help to better identify

846
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:58,049
cross-border dro checks and the second

847
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,150
point is of course very much linked with

848
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:05,120
the capital market Union I think 11

849
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:07,800
truth just in this room is that

850
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:11,910
sometimes listening to the Commission I

851
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:14,160
of T the impression that people really

852
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:18,240
think that the internal market in Europe

853
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:21,899
is working it's not and of course we

854
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,779
have to our utmost to strengthen the

855
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,730
internal market sometimes it's just a

856
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,650
question of European customers and

857
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,290
consumers because they don't care about

858
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,060
European internal market they just buy

859
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:35,370
local products which of course is very

860
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,770
much welcome but again we have to do

861
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:40,290
more on to get the benefits out of the

862
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:43,050
of the internal market and the capital

863
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:47,009
market Union and by Commissioner Hill is

864
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:50,430
an important again another pillar in

865
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:53,580
this comprehensive picture because it

866
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:55,169
has one essential aim if there are

867
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,779
hurdles and future times because of

868
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:00,510
regulation and maybe also because this

869
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,390
regulation bank regulation is necessary

870
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:07,140
because it's a learning curve out of the

871
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:10,140
financial crisis 2008 if the banks are

872
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,109
not able any longer than future times to

873
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:16,080
finance the economy and giving credits

874
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:18,780
to enemies and others and then we need

875
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,720
alternative ways to find this kind of

876
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,420
funding and financing and as again

877
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,060
brings us back to the capital market

878
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:32,790
Union to find better ways especially for

879
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:36,680
SMEs to access the capital market this

880
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:40,170
is very much about transparency ratings

881
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,180
sharing of risks and SMEs and so on and

882
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:44,610
so forth this is about promoting

883
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,330
financial instruments which of course

884
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:50,330
had been very much criticized

885
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:52,520
a crisis like securitization high

886
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:56,420
standard securitisation and so on and so

887
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:59,210
forth so very much convinced that this

888
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,040
is the right way to go in the role of

889
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:05,900
the state and the role of the country's

890
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:10,400
in my view is is is a limited one it's

891
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:13,390
about the the catalyst role that we

892
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,160
mentioned it's about supporting

893
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:20,660
investors it's all about risk sharing

894
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,520
and in my view it's not about copying

895
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:25,310
the mistakes of the past what we did

896
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:28,040
over the last 20 years is that some of

897
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:30,680
our European countries had three percent

898
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,779
of the gdp financed by European

899
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,430
structural funds and what happened it's

900
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:37,550
exactly they invested in infrastructure

901
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:39,859
that means the third highway but no

902
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:41,840
traffic running on the highway these are

903
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,960
the mistakes of the past and that is why

904
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,870
we always stress viable projects rather

905
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,530
than just projects and that is why I

906
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:53,930
guess we are all in the Cutie to really

907
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,300
listen to private investors and to

908
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:58,790
identify what are the hurdles what are

909
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:02,330
the obstacles what are the Plaka chures

910
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:04,790
if the mass fish criterion is a is a

911
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:06,860
blockage let's let's discussed it but

912
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:10,160
please not in the way that the

913
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:13,490
Commission sometimes tends to to discuss

914
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,549
it that first we have an more

915
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:18,649
flexibility through an investment closed

916
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:20,900
then through another clause which is of

917
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:23,690
course called the structural reform

918
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:26,360
clause now we are talking a third clause

919
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,730
which is called the refugee clause and

920
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,340
the fourth Clause I guess will be the

921
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,780
so-called Christmas clothes you know so

922
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,150
and this is the wrong way to go because

923
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:38,440
it would not foster credibility in our

924
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:42,530
system but we really have to look at the

925
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:46,310
important things and I have noted that

926
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:49,100
maybe we both should talk to eurostat on

927
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:51,590
the booking on Public Accounts the

928
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,360
question of ppps what kind of part

929
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:55,610
should be on the public accounts what

930
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,650
part should be on the private accounts

931
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,270
so this is a very concrete and precise

932
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,090
issue that are more than happy to take

933
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,810
home and to

934
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:05,760
to clarify very good a good man you

935
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,860
wanted to come back in and I just don't

936
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,380
the cross-border saying because the

937
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:12,810
whole of the European Union was founded

938
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,060
on the idea that if countries in Europe

939
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,650
share critical infrastructure markets

940
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:19,200
and regulation they are less likely to

941
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:22,010
go war against each other so that's a

942
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,569
very core of our European project now a

943
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,430
lot of things have happened and for

944
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,110
still border crossing capacities in

945
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:29,730
energy for example are very relevant

946
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,500
especially in the central Eastern

947
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:34,910
European part where the dependence on

948
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,650
energy especially oil and gas is huge

949
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:42,930
but one thing I wanted to race you there

950
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:45,660
was a great initiative a year ago by

951
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:48,210
Angela Merkel on what we call the Berlin

952
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,700
process when I was referring to that the

953
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:53,010
how to integrate the Western Balkans how

954
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,220
to keep the Western Balkans looking at

955
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,690
Europe and not looking east which is the

956
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,240
problem if somebody is standing too long

957
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:03,360
in a queue they have the idea of joining

958
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,649
maybe another queue which goes faster so

959
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,420
how do we do that then the Western

960
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,920
Balkans project the core issue if you

961
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,780
talk to the Prime Minister's or

962
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,870
ministers of economy of the Western

963
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:16,170
Balkan countries is infrastructure

964
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:18,509
connectivity and if we could create in

965
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,270
the Western Balkans cross-border project

966
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:23,070
and there are roads there for example

967
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:25,680
the road coming from Croatia via

968
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:29,010
Montenegro to Albania another one that

969
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,009
goes from Serbia through kosovo to

970
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:36,570
albania if these cross-border projects

971
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:38,250
could be realized with the help of div

972
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:41,040
and the other international financial

973
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:43,620
institutions and private investment that

974
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,720
would completely change the landscape

975
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:48,690
the political landscape of the Western

976
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:51,540
Balkans so infrastructure can very

977
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:54,690
quickly deliver not very quickly quite

978
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:57,240
slowly but it can it can deliver very

979
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:59,760
significant political results and

980
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,439
therefore cross-border is relevant also

981
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,700
at our neighborhood especially at times

982
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,920
when people think that the critical

983
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:08,580
infrastructure in the Western Balkans is

984
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,990
raising fancies at the borders we're

985
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:13,019
running quite long time if there was

986
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:19,558
anybody who wanted to ask question

987
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:21,178
the point from anybody no okay no one no

988
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:26,159
one wants to stand up defend the

989
00:44:21,179 --> 00:44:32,880
commission against against for your a

990
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:35,279
stat for that matter yes okay so i'm

991
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,509
steppin up at the very beginning I was

992
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:41,549
very struck that island as a referred to

993
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:43,679
be eid is potentially a macroeconomic

994
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:46,679
stabilization tool I was wondering if

995
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:49,109
that was something an ambition that the

996
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:54,089
German government shared for the for the

997
00:44:49,109 --> 00:45:00,029
eib I'm not so sure whether the IB would

998
00:44:54,089 --> 00:45:02,699
like to to have that that role and maybe

999
00:45:00,029 --> 00:45:06,479
you should ask vana Jolla again whether

1000
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:08,069
he would really assume this kind of role

1001
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:11,279
but of course it goes without saying

1002
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:15,929
that the eib is one element and one

1003
00:45:11,279 --> 00:45:19,829
instrument in that sense and that we

1004
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:23,639
have to better make use of our of our

1005
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:26,279
European instruments in in place it's

1006
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:29,639
it's not the the instrument from a macro

1007
00:45:26,279 --> 00:45:31,409
economic point of view otherwise we

1008
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:33,209
would make another mistake in my view

1009
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:36,869
that we always concentrate on the

1010
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:42,868
European a level we concentrate on a

1011
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:45,239
kind of European fiscal stance and we

1012
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:47,549
create maybe another expectation on the

1013
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,679
European level it only goes together in

1014
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:51,479
my view and I guess just very much in

1015
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:57,989
line with was said in this panel

1016
00:45:51,479 --> 00:46:00,388
together with the homework and the EDD

1017
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:03,389
elements that can be done on the on the

1018
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:08,789
national level Europe is still to some

1019
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:11,789
extent a union very much based on on the

1020
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:14,249
National competences many of us would

1021
00:46:11,789 --> 00:46:17,429
think that we should have better

1022
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:19,259
progress on the European level in the

1023
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:22,169
sense that we need more European

1024
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:24,149
competences also in that in that respect

1025
00:46:22,169 --> 00:46:25,920
but we are not yet there we are willing

1026
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:28,910
to go into that direction but as

1027
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,910
long as European

1028
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,710
you
