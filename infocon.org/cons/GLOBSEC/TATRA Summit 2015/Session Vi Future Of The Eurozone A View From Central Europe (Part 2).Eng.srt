1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
muscled inject liquidity within the

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,560
eurozone which had disadvantage you ever

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,110
hear ya on the whole taking a longer

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,469
perspective it had much more advantages

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:16,049
to to have the possibility and emerge of

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,270
Minerva given by the autonomous monetary

7
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,880
policy in our case thank you that that

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:25,430
might be specific to anger miss you

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,810
discover actually I stole our whole

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,099
banking sector in the Czech Republic

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,710
actually the liquidity in the checker

12
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:37,770
market is enough so so this is not the

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:42,690
posh for our country to thinking about

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:47,610
the entering banking Union in a one two

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:49,739
three years also if we take it from the

16
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,010
another point of view from for example

17
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,349
lender of last resort perspective it

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,379
should be enough banking curve for

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,350
banking Union the ECB so this is also

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:05,670
not the case or argument for the Czech

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,619
Republic because our banking system is

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,140
quite a resistance which will show

23
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:14,280
during the last financial crisis major

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,409
problems as to the second question as

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,799
the oreck our reaction on five

26
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,479
presidents report the Czech Republic

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,810
understands the purpose of deeper

28
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,900
integration of the eurozone and i think

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,740
that the we welcomed that all you member

30
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:36,150
states are included in the discussion of

31
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,810
the proposed measures because they have

32
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:44,189
also clear impact on no no no zone

33
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,979
members and as I said the what is

34
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,189
important for us all that the approach

35
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,720
to the euro and no no euro area or

36
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:57,600
member states should remain balanced

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,420
estudio fiscal Union IV agreed that the

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,689
more unified fiscal Union policy has to

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,310
play a role in the properly functioning

40
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,079
car monetary union so we understand this

41
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:13,310
direction in

42
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,550
european commission okay but also of the

43
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,550
view of mr. balik that it was more in

44
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,920
your interest or more in the interest of

45
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,080
your country to stay outside for the

46
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,790
moment and to be part of it if you look

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,790
back of the over the last seven years

48
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,540
okay as they're already any bet will be

49
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,830
the next member any bed from the

50
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,000
audience I don't know what I say the

51
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,000
question was up but I thought there was

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,190
no response so we've kept in complete

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,840
darkness hunts you have a bit but Hans

54
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:47,720
is coming from the western part so he's

55
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:54,610
a compatriot could you probably explain

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:56,870
why hands it was a microphone came of it

57
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,430
but we had to ask this this morning

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,230
Livington let's have it he had a

59
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,540
response on that but of course coming

60
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:06,290
from London he probably will have very

61
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:10,459
clear reply on that question any other

62
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,620
bets know from this side of the EU on

63
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:17,420
this issue then we probably go on to our

64
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,920
next questions I mean there was a

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,890
suggestion let's say that we disc oh you

66
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,410
wanted to say something for mr. Barack I

67
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,260
didn't react on the under the present

68
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:31,910
support and you have mentioned that it

69
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:34,220
is mostly for the eurozone again I would

70
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,260
be I would give a more fine-tuned the

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,320
reaction to that I think that the five

72
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,870
presidents reports is for the 28 except

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,269
for that there are certain structures

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,670
proposed a new institution proposed

75
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:51,590
which should be at the first wave

76
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:55,130
mandatory for the eurozone members only

77
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:59,320
but and as we see it from from the

78
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:02,510
outside ins and out but we are the outs

79
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,390
whatever this whatever negotiations we

80
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,850
start basically five president support

81
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,790
is a vision and we welcome that that

82
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:13,250
finally after so many years now at least

83
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,279
they're a thirst blueprint of a of a

84
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:19,548
future of the euro the direction or a

85
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,529
roadmap if you wish where the European

86
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:23,840
Union would like to go is

87
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:26,570
and that's absolutely positive we have

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,260
to have a vision especially after a

89
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:33,860
crisis situation but it has to be very

90
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,830
clear that yes you are right there are

91
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,000
institutions to be put in place in one

92
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,070
way or another there are many

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,710
discussions yet it is not crystal clear

94
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,230
yet in many respects what will be the

95
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,810
final form what legal obligation we

96
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,310
remain but mandatory only 40 the

97
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,200
eurozone countries but the whole

98
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,020
negotiation should be first of all

99
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,530
transparent second inclusive and

100
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,240
Outsiders should be included taking part

101
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,549
in the nectar sale because in the future

102
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,850
that will be our institutions also so we

103
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:07,070
want to take part how whatever fiscal or

104
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,070
competitiveness authorities would look

105
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:13,310
like and also as in the case of the

106
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:17,150
banking Union to be open for accession

107
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:21,020
even without joining the eurozone if the

108
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,469
country itself is able to and we link to

109
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,090
join because the advantages of course

110
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:29,360
taking couple the obligations on

111
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,010
voluntary basis if the advantages seems

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,169
to be positive so with this

113
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,419
understanding we think that it is also

114
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,909
for the 28 and not only for the eurozone

115
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:41,120
members and we are very keen and we are

116
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:44,090
trying to follow very strongly how the

117
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,940
fine-tuning of this blueprint if you

118
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,630
wish will develop we take part in

119
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:54,289
discussion and we want to be included so

120
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,940
a very important point you're not

121
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,430
formally included and the vice president

122
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,590
supports discussions but you want would

123
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,330
like to be included or your informally

124
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,179
included but you like to be more

125
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,280
formally included we are included we are

126
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,890
already included in the discussions to

127
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,109
the extent the general discussion has

128
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,300
started at the level of ministers in a

129
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,950
caffeine for instance we are part of the

130
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,270
discussion no question about that but

131
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:22,960
the details of the realization of these

132
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:26,000
proposals the details of the proposed

133
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,940
institutions the legal background is not

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,090
developed at all maybe somewhere in the

135
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,849
back corridors but not not publicly but

136
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,609
as soon as it develops and we are going

137
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,188
into the

138
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,639
this we want we would like to remain

139
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:43,620
part of the discussions even in the more

140
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,939
detailed so you were part of it but

141
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,530
you're afraid that you will not part of

142
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,719
being discussing for example the details

143
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,150
of the fiscal council of this

144
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:53,099
competitiveness council no I wouldn't

145
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,830
say that we are afraid we want to be

146
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,840
sure that we are not forgotten we are

147
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,770
not ignored but we don't afraid for the

148
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,840
time being we have got inch assurances

149
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,758
quite important assurances from eurozone

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,008
member states and also from the

151
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,439
presidency and also from the commission

152
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,569
that we will be included but we want to

153
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,610
me because if you read the document and

154
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:17,000
as you had the impression that is more

155
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,069
for the eurozone then for the outsiders

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,919
that is from the text of the it is

157
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,889
sometimes Oh back it is not clear cut in

158
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,698
all chapters whether it is for the 28

159
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:31,279
but it is only for the 19 and that's why

160
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,020
we think that this clarification

161
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,900
crystallized in Dettori basis the

162
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,389
eurozone countries but the rest of these

163
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,839
countries should be included and anyone

164
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:45,569
is reading the text don't misunderstand

165
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,969
or don't have i would say incorrect

166
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:50,580
conclusions from the epicness of the

167
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:53,690
text that's why I say do we don't have

168
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,520
any fear so far outsiders will be on

169
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,919
continuous basis involved but that's I

170
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,049
think very important in exactly variable

171
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,698
very important point I'm confused I must

172
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,020
confess I've i read it i would think

173
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,330
let's say it has to do with fiscal

174
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,620
issues mostly for the eurozone of course

175
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,628
it's a five presidents report we know

176
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,729
that one of these five presence is not

177
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:13,020
part of the eurozone so he may have

178
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,128
brought up his issues as well but

179
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,490
formally he's there to represent

180
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,169
European Council so anyhow this you

181
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,830
discover mr. let's say you want to say

182
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:26,039
just from the point of non-eurozone

183
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:30,000
country absolutely we stress and we

184
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:33,718
agreed that the equal treatment or phone

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,149
should be fulfilled and also the

186
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,310
approach to your unknown URL County

187
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,349
should be balanced as to the question of

188
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,018
five presidents airport or another ones

189
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,600
but I think it's all words which are

190
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,279
quite a

191
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,130
only heard from the non eurozone

192
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,750
countries yeah probably a question to

193
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,310
mr. let's say let's say at your

194
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,020
perspective on this five presence report

195
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:56,250
but being inside the eurozone if you

196
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,050
look at your neighboring countries

197
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,540
meaning you see this as being a report

198
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,400
of essentially the eurozone club or it

199
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,579
is really a report of the EU as a whole

200
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,040
is it not essentially ninety percent of

201
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,910
the issues addressing eurozone related

202
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:15,329
issues and that mostly hardly considers

203
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:17,400
the issues relevant to the non eurozone

204
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,830
countries and by this is already

205
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,800
creating I mean a kind of an implicit

206
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:24,900
divided between the eurozone and on

207
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,589
eurozone countries I'm looking at the

208
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,209
reports as a report for the 28th

209
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,339
definitely but I think it's quite

210
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,800
natural that there is some stress or

211
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,110
some focus on what's going on in the

212
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,930
eurozone because as we have said like

213
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:44,130
once once you have given up the monetary

214
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,260
autonomy and once the crisis relates to

215
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,990
the currency that is common for for

216
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,430
several member states so so it's natural

217
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:55,800
that there are there are many proposals

218
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,270
with a particular side of the eurozone

219
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,339
members but I wouldn't say it's

220
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:04,230
exclusive for for the eurozone it's for

221
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:06,000
the 28th it has to be 44 4 28 and if

222
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,720
sees we have a lot of discussions on

223
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,490
that and i think it's it's and contain

224
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,830
all the details because as you said it's

225
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,720
a vision i mean it has got some it has

226
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,390
got some ideas from up with the ideas

227
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:21,209
such as european physical board etc we

228
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,000
can get to that in a while but i thought

229
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,170
it engages member states inside and

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,930
outside of the eurozone in the

231
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:31,800
discussion and then after public and

232
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:36,599
worked work on technical details and and

233
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,089
and design those those elements and

234
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,040
institutions in detail but four is

235
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,740
extremely important meaning the further

236
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,420
road map or a further technical plan

237
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,459
related to what was in the five

238
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,140
presidents report is extremely important

239
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,479
in the domain of economic policymaking

240
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,900
absolutely this for us for sure and i

241
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,220
believe for colleagues as well okay are

242
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,160
there any questions and the audience

243
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,660
about the five presidents report

244
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,429
now I mean of course it's a technical

245
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,769
issue but I think it's a very important

246
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,790
issue I personally found the report I

247
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:08,009
think there were some others in the

248
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,899
audience who taught that with me lacked

249
00:11:08,009 --> 00:11:12,809
technical details I wanted to have more

250
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:16,290
of these details about if you say we

251
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:17,670
want to have a fiscal union by 2027 how

252
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,069
we would get there that's why I asked

253
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,599
you the question so you hope let's say

254
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:26,040
that these things will be worked out and

255
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,670
the coming yeah the years months and

256
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:33,079
years months and years the the

257
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:37,709
Commission announced two weeks ago that

258
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:39,238
in in 2016 they set up an expert group

259
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:41,670
that will work on the on the

260
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:44,040
institutions or proposals for the

261
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,209
stage-two we are quite happy that it

262
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,639
will be during the time of the sloak

263
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:50,248
presidency in years time so we're very

264
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:53,519
happy to assist in the because it's the

265
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:57,110
phase two is a priority for us and also

266
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,489
the Commission indicated that in 2017

267
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,170
they will publish a white paper which

268
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:04,790
will go definitely into more detail than

269
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:09,089
the five presidents report on the

270
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:11,579
measures in the interface too so I

271
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:14,369
believe these discussions are all are

272
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:16,799
already happening will be happening and

273
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:19,339
in the months and years to come and

274
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,629
there will be more concrete proposals

275
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,189
there's one question at the back yes we

276
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:24,629
can probably take it right away if it's

277
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:27,029
related to the five presidents report

278
00:12:24,629 --> 00:12:30,600
sorry more or less economic policymaking

279
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:33,629
and thank you Mathias rumor from the

280
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,029
Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs just

281
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:39,809
a question on on the report in relation

282
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:42,029
to competitiveness reforms in general

283
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:44,189
mean what would you be able to say which

284
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:46,740
is the more important implementing the

285
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:48,240
five presidents reports or report or

286
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,119
pushing ahead with more general

287
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,089
competitiveness reforms such as

288
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:58,399
deepening the single market trade

289
00:12:53,089 --> 00:13:00,540
education research and so forth it's

290
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,220
certainly overlapping of course there

291
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,929
are things which are overlapping that

292
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,160
the broader single market agenda the

293
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,990
structural reforms which are mentioned

294
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,490
this morning and then the specific

295
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,439
things related to what is in the five

296
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,640
president support but they're also since

297
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:14,069
you're representing a sweet

298
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,010
it's rated two issues which are of a

299
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,650
relevant for the eu28 yes mr. yeah AB

300
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,510
bulk yeah I think that that's a very

301
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,430
important point that while we are

302
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,710
speaking of five president support we

303
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,989
are always saying from an outsider's

304
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,180
point of view that the integrity the

305
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,430
single market should not be touched upon

306
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,829
I mean it should be kept and even

307
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,810
strengthen to the extent possible the

308
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,700
second point out of that it comes that

309
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,770
competitiveness or improvement of

310
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,870
competitiveness is an issue and a very

311
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,390
important issue but why we are

312
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,540
concentrating on the structural issues

313
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:51,689
we might have a vision and we are not

314
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:56,040
against it that we I mean the European

315
00:13:51,690 --> 00:14:01,710
Union is moving ahead having some future

316
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:04,530
ideas future objectives before its eyes

317
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:11,040
including with all the 28 countries and

318
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:14,069
it is something constructing in the move

319
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,079
in the movement how would I put it this

320
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,610
fight president support in my

321
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,100
understanding if you compare with

322
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:24,840
paintings first the main sketch is

323
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:27,420
already on the on the picture the main

324
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,070
protagonist in a structured way I

325
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,500
already on the picture but colors

326
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:37,080
background i would say shadows and

327
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,500
sunshine is not painted yet and the

328
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,290
coming weeks mumps and even years now

329
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,870
the details of the whole picture will be

330
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,839
developed and maybe i can even imagine

331
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,750
that the painter the painters together

332
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,880
the 28 painters will decide that one

333
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,460
protagonist which was put on the on the

334
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,290
canvas at the beginning maybe it should

335
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,420
disappear and that other protagonist

336
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:04,160
should be put there so what I mean it is

337
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,810
a very constructive a kind of a ongoing

338
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,910
production if you wish we're really the

339
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,699
sketch is already there and we really

340
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:14,310
welcome that as I said but we know that

341
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,500
there are plenty of work still to arrive

342
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:18,900
to finishing or finalizing the picture

343
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,960
and hopefully to put it in the loop but

344
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,850
or somewhere else but but really I think

345
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,949
that's a good start

346
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,139
and within that competitiveness

347
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:31,609
strengthening competitiveness and not

348
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:36,389
and if I may have a bit between brackets

349
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:39,149
any intention to deteriorate deteriorate

350
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:41,160
competitive this should be avoided what

351
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:43,110
I mean by deteriorating competitiveness

352
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,209
there are certain proposals for instance

353
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:49,560
about strengthening social dimensions

354
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:51,449
and very few people is thinking when

355
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,518
speaking about strengthening social

356
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:56,339
dimensions it's the question of

357
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,380
competitiveness countries outside of the

358
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,399
eurozone many countries outside of the

359
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:04,680
eurozone is would like to still improve

360
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,769
its competitiveness it's partly question

361
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,109
of wages obviously but once we are

362
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:13,920
putting the some social dimensions in

363
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:16,860
and we would have a kind of a push for

364
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,800
higher wages suddenly and not in an

365
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,009
organic way that would mean that these

366
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,019
countries competitive would deteriorate

367
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:27,600
it's their convergence would slow down

368
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:31,319
or even would turn in the other

369
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,970
direction and overall overall the EU

370
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,120
overall competitiveness would

371
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,649
deteriorate if today there are

372
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,949
transports relatively low-cost

373
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:45,149
transports from Bulgaria Romania Hungary

374
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:47,250
I don't know Poland this adds up to the

375
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,860
competitiveness of German French and

376
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,410
Spanish companies if I with the social

377
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,860
dimension element I bringing up the

378
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:58,469
wages and I just try to make disappear

379
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,029
this competitive advantage that would

380
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:02,970
mean that French Spanish and German

381
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:05,579
companies who are taking using these

382
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,770
transport possibility would be less

383
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:10,589
competitive and I think that on the long

384
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,299
run a medium and long run strengthening

385
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,698
of the competitiveness is an issue for

386
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:17,490
the European Union we know looking Asia

387
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:20,250
looking the United States we can't

388
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,409
afford to deteriorate competitors on the

389
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,359
contrary that's something which we have

390
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:27,120
to we have to strengthen very strongly

391
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,100
okay thank you bashira scope I have you

392
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,750
on this issue of the integrity of single

393
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,129
market the competitiveness of the Iwo

394
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:36,230
overall not too much kind of new burdens

395
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:40,340
make the balance between two

396
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:42,620
so this to Buster I stutter something

397
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,260
news in European Union better

398
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:48,979
institution where the concept and so on

399
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:53,030
there should be something like higher

400
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,549
principle like in the way that there

401
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,970
should be focused on evaluation of X

402
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:01,730
extinct instruments before creating a

403
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,160
new one and this is not a reaction to

404
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,570
the five presidents a record because

405
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,980
from the opposition of the Czech

406
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:12,230
Republic be welcome this dis concept but

407
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,370
the aesthetic creation the fiscal

408
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:20,390
austerity and so on we think that this

409
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:22,639
principle should be followed okay if I

410
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:26,090
could link up to another issue as i said

411
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,860
already this morning commission some

412
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:29,959
rough keys refer to or the vice

413
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,659
president this plus the broskis refer to

414
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,549
the eventual review of the treaty what

415
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,890
is coming often open brussels if we

416
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:38,299
revise the treaty to do things where we

417
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,309
distinguish between the eurozone and

418
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:43,250
Iran eurozone and then then we're back

419
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:45,980
into this issue which you mentioned how

420
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,270
or back into another issue which is high

421
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,950
on the table in brussels by the way

422
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,970
which the Brits and the context of the

423
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:54,490
British I mean reform proposals which

424
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,390
they want to have from Brussels some

425
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,400
guarantee that they will not be

426
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,049
discriminated against in the context of

427
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,850
the single market if I could ask a

428
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:04,040
question first to mr. let's say how you

429
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,439
look at it from your perspective if

430
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,299
there were to be treaty review whether

431
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,220
you would favor a distinction between

432
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:12,650
eurozone and the non eurozone which has

433
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,570
to do with kind of the eurozone Council

434
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,330
which has to do with the accountability

435
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,620
mechanisms with the transparency with

436
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,290
reporting from the eurozone which

437
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:26,209
formerly is still something which is

438
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:28,610
somewhere in limbo if you allow me I

439
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:31,160
will I would like to very briefly react

440
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,799
to the question from the audience before

441
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,799
address your question I do not think

442
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:40,340
that the issues or the document of five

443
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,040
presidents and competitiveness is our

444
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,100
aren't these two issues that they would

445
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,820
be in conflict actually the the five

446
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,090
presidents report

447
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:54,000
means proposals for national

448
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,820
competitiveness authorities and I don't

449
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,990
think that the single it's either or

450
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,120
question like I do you have five

451
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,530
presidents visions or you keep single

452
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,239
market I think these two are not

453
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:09,410
mutually exclusive they should

454
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:11,880
complement each other and as we set

455
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,590
single market although it can be

456
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,070
improved it's there so you don't need to

457
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:19,439
deal with that too much in a visionary

458
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,060
document or a visionary sketch so I'd

459
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,250
like to subscribe to what has been said

460
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:29,490
before to your question on treaties I

461
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,220
don't feel I have the mandate to talk

462
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,570
for for the soil government on on

463
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,980
treaties that would be that would need

464
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,100
to be coordinated with the Ministry of

465
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,440
Foreign Affairs nevertheless where when

466
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,189
we talk about further integration and

467
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,310
further steps let's say on our way to to

468
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,950
fiscal union or on our way to deeper

469
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:53,159
physically integrate the eurozone or or

470
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,080
the EU we have in mind also some

471
00:20:53,160 --> 00:21:00,510
mechanisms that are feasible without

472
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:02,939
treaty changes so we believe that or and

473
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:07,590
now it's my personal view like treaty

474
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,930
will will have to change at some point

475
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,570
I'm not saying now we're in a year or in

476
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,860
few years but it will be it will be a

477
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,960
lengthy process it will be a very

478
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,479
political process I I think it will be

479
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,350
less necessary divisive as well for the

480
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:24,150
you / me it could be divisive it well

481
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,610
but all the discussions are in a way

482
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,710
divisive so so you have different views

483
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,260
and then hopefully you come at the end

484
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,990
and and have some common decision so i

485
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,460
I'm I'm not so skeptical it would be

486
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,760
divisive in the way like it would be the

487
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,470
end of the you know I don't think so and

488
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,230
any few some the audience on the whole

489
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:47,130
issue of I present support treaty review

490
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,690
yes there's somebody in the middle it

491
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,490
could also be related to for several

492
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,580
what Brittany's putting on the table in

493
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:57,020
Brussels if you please introduce

494
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,090
yourself my name is Samuel Yama I

495
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,040
at egmont the royal institute for

496
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,080
international relations I have a

497
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,070
question or getting the last part of the

498
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:10,250
report the political aspect because it's

499
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:13,600
very it is not clear what exactly they

500
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:16,490
want to do regarding accountability and

501
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,620
the emulsion the fact that we have to

502
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,820
improve that role of the of national

503
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,840
parliaments of the European Parliament

504
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,760
but we don't know exactly what it means

505
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:28,639
in my point of view we need to create

506
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,700
our own committee within the open

507
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,650
Parliament I would like to do what do

508
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,480
you think about that thank you so

509
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,680
meaning you're addressing the question

510
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,570
or you want to have the question

511
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,790
respondent which I raised whether you

512
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,310
need to have a eurozone committee for

513
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,560
which within the parliament basically a

514
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:47,659
form of accountability of the eurozone

515
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,070
group towards European Parliament which

516
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,940
is already going in the direction of

517
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:56,210
what I said so mr. Barack good question

518
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,040
i think that the last part of the five

519
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,290
presidents report is a part of the

520
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,260
sketch which is not very elaborated yet

521
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:07,700
the idea is obviously there but it is as

522
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:10,820
far as i know it is not very intensively

523
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,390
discussed so far even within the

524
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:17,179
European Union but that raises a

525
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,010
question about democratic accountability

526
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,020
which i think is a very legitimate

527
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,600
question strengthening democratic

528
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,310
legitimately there's much stronger

529
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,610
involvement of national parliaments

530
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:31,730
that's again a legitimate question and

531
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:34,790
not necessarily i think the commission

532
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:37,160
or ourselves have the final answer how

533
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,020
what would be the techniques what would

534
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,060
be the solution for that but the

535
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,220
objective and i fully agree with that

536
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:46,610
the objective is there the your question

537
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:51,140
whether it can be divisive frankly

538
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:53,810
speaking yes most probably it cannot be

539
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,690
excluded that a certain moment of time a

540
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:59,179
treaty change will be unavoidable is

541
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,490
further structural institutional

542
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,280
development of the European Union is for

543
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,350
see of course when this time will arrive

544
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,030
then politically speaking at that's

545
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,409
highly political then politically

546
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:13,430
speaking

547
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:15,800
the maturity of the proposals and of

548
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:17,870
course the larger European audience

549
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,750
because in most countries at the end of

550
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:23,149
the day that will be object or subject

551
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:26,480
to a referendum and of course with all

552
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:29,870
its risks so I think it's a highly

553
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,520
sensitive issue logically thinking and

554
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,649
personal my view is that's unavoidable

555
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,260
that a certain moment of time the time

556
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:40,400
will come for TD change but how to

557
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:42,470
manage the right timing the extreme

558
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,080
important the event is raising the

559
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,090
awareness of the citizens who are going

560
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,639
to what about that to create an

561
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,889
atmosphere that it is really understood

562
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,310
what is proposed that what is at stake

563
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:57,080
is extremely important so I wouldn't go

564
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:59,960
further than that and the last point

565
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:04,370
which I want to make I can only imagine

566
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:07,490
a future your pay union where it's

567
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:10,100
finally a big family and the big family

568
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,170
one might have better talent for that

569
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,600
and the other one better music talent

570
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,010
and so on but at the end of the day I

571
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,840
wouldn't like to be a member of the

572
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,760
family when you have first class members

573
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,490
and second class and third class members

574
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,230
within the family in the family each and

575
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:27,050
every family member should be on the

576
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:29,300
same footing even if he or she plays

577
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,310
better piano and the other is better

578
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:33,980
talented in languages but at the end of

579
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,960
the day that's all of the members of the

580
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:39,500
family who are living within the family

581
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:43,220
so I I can't imagine frankly speaking on

582
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,610
the long term a very divided first class

583
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,780
and second class Europe exactly max with

584
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,189
the same question let's say no

585
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,440
discrimination we need to have the

586
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,680
single market integrity of say of the EU

587
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,670
for the eu28 overall mature escoba you

588
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,220
want to add something on that issue

589
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:02,090
before I turn to a eurozone member again

590
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:04,820
I think that from the eurozone countries

591
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:06,439
it will set everything nothing nobody

592
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,000
good but I founded a company of the egg

593
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,440
league with our colleague and I found

594
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,330
this extremely important to hear they

595
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,190
certainly because of course we may hear

596
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,139
it in Brussels in the context of the

597
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,420
British debate but not necessarily is

598
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,490
coming from the country's Poland Czech

599
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,110
Republic Hungary missile to say

600
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,650
something on that issue on the integrity

601
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,320
of fully agree

602
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,330
very very briefly are regarding the

603
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,820
political legitimacy that that was one

604
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,490
of the questions so I many times during

605
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,520
our discussions on deep integration is

606
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:39,060
set and rightly so that many proposals

607
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,970
would require would require functioning

608
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,770
political union and I agree like in the

609
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,830
ideal world in the best of all possible

610
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:48,990
worlds it would be the case like should

611
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,419
we have a common eurozone budget then

612
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:54,180
yes it should be run by some kind of a

613
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,540
common Democratic Authority with some

614
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,550
responsibility with accountability etc

615
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:01,500
nevertheless I think like we are we are

616
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:05,310
facing issues that are more pressing and

617
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,440
that we should not basically turn the

618
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,240
perfect into an enemy of the good and we

619
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,310
have good solutions that do not require

620
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:15,680
a fully functioning political union and

621
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:18,000
that's why we stress in our proposals

622
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,540
instruments instead of like fully

623
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,840
functioning fiscal union or political

624
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:27,180
union it's possible to have some good

625
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,280
solutions even even without a treaty

626
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:32,340
change in without a political union but

627
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,830
I totally agree in the end it would be

628
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:38,250
it would be very good if there is some

629
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:41,580
sense of responsibility and legitimacy

630
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,110
political political any other questions

631
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,720
we have about five minutes left and I

632
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,419
think we touch them some very important

633
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,540
issues alesh a former colleague of mine

634
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:54,180
but who is working in Czech Republic

635
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:57,240
thank you alishmas czech government

636
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,430
office I have a question that was then

637
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,650
we have touched upon a little bit we

638
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,230
talked about treaty change but about EU

639
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:05,940
treaty change but what if it there will

640
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:08,010
be actually a euro zone treaty change in

641
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,710
a sense what if there is a further

642
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,540
integration of the eurozone but not so

643
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,240
much of the EU what would the central

644
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:18,060
european countries think being left in a

645
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,090
second tier of some kind of an EU but

646
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:22,919
not not the quarry you and how how could

647
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,490
they react what could we do right now to

648
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,900
prevent this could you explain Alice

649
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,760
what you mean by the euro zone treaty

650
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,410
change meaning as far as I know there's

651
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,120
no euro zone three tables there's no

652
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,460
eurozone as an institution and

653
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,280
33 t change will have to be made under

654
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,559
the EU law the question is what if there

655
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,960
are some what if some proposals that we

656
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,240
here in Brussels we here in Paris maybe

657
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,059
less in Berlin about some further

658
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,710
integration of the eurozone and what

659
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,450
would the countries that are outside

660
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:57,930
think about this and how could they

661
00:28:51,450 --> 00:29:00,090
react to this who dares to start your

662
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,430
camera just just shortly I think that

663
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,159
this will be very or it is a very

664
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:09,090
sensitive issue and difficult to answer

665
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:12,390
and I still do not believe that it will

666
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:15,480
change that that this movement or this

667
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:18,000
push meant for the changing will be so

668
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,580
strong because otherwise there would be

669
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,830
or there will be a possibility that and

670
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,389
other countries and it's not the check

671
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:27,570
perspective i do not think i'll just

672
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:30,030
just as a me as a person could follow

673
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:32,280
the british example you know which one

674
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:35,639
during the referendum on so on so i

675
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:42,600
think it's a very sensitive issue and it

676
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:44,820
could create very ml strong imbalances

677
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,500
within the European Union among a lot of

678
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:53,939
countries mr. borrow my view and I think

679
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,890
I try to explain that of course I can't

680
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:58,080
speculate what the reaction should be

681
00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:00,000
but it would be very much against the

682
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:06,000
thinking and the mentality of my

683
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:11,040
government so as I said we are for the

684
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,140
full Europe that doesn't mean that some

685
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,659
countries which have members of the

686
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,730
eurozone cannot go faster and going

687
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:22,230
ahead in integration but legally

688
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:25,530
speaking the ins and outs cannot be

689
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:28,860
divided or excluded if you wish from

690
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:30,540
from one to another so we I think that

691
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,340
and of course that speculation and

692
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,290
that's my personal view we would be

693
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,530
extremely negative on that we good

694
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:40,470
against this and in what way and Mara I

695
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,660
don't know that speculation but it is

696
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,580
very much against the Hungarian thinking

697
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:46,770
we think that we have to go hand-in-hand

698
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,570
together which doesn't

699
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,280
to the possibility for the eurozone

700
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:53,340
members to go faster and integrate

701
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:57,420
faster institute I'll institutionalizing

702
00:30:53,340 --> 00:31:00,209
new bodies and new structures provided

703
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,760
that is open also for the outsiders if

704
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:05,490
they so wish and they are able to and

705
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,180
willing to abide the rules of the game

706
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,130
that has perfectly could be produced

707
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,140
through the banking Union there is a

708
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,690
practical experience and the banking

709
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,450
Union proposal was put forward that was

710
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:21,030
put forward for the 28 all the 28

711
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,340
members participated in discussion at

712
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:26,360
the end of the day obviously that was

713
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:29,639
mandatory for the eurozone members and

714
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,709
volume and voluntary basis any country

715
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,740
could have a close cooperation with the

716
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:37,170
ECB and I as far as I know there are at

717
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,240
least two countries which are eager to

718
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:41,040
closely cooperate with the sea beyond

719
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,780
average other ones also there i was in

720
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,210
eurozone there are ones which want to

721
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,010
obtain now into the eurozone and now

722
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,960
Denmark is one which ones who don't join

723
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,870
but politically they cannot so hungry

724
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,610
wants it is not rejected on the second

725
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,679
one the second one is Romania it is

726
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,439
public public information Romania is

727
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,660
definitely wish to cooperate closely

728
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,350
with the ECB as far as the banking Union

729
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:06,030
is concerned hungary has did not make

730
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,980
any decision because we think that the

731
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,110
banking Union is not fully finished yet

732
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,720
the whole structure and that is about

733
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:15,300
the deposit insurance scheme which is

734
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,310
now again on the table yes we of course

735
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,680
would like to gather some practical

736
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:25,580
experience how the banking you know

737
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:28,800
really functions and on one hand

738
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:32,820
assuring stability for the banking

739
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:35,100
system how the business models and how

740
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:37,770
the operation of the banking system is

741
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,980
going we it's already in place for

742
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,900
roughly for one you know almost except

743
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,290
for one day one year and what the one

744
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,730
day exactly November forth so I think we

745
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,280
are gathering the practical information

746
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,290
we see how the because what was the

747
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:56,010
objective of the banking Union to cut

748
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:57,980
the vicious circle of the sovereign and

749
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:01,730
the banking

750
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:04,010
in-depth knees and at the end of the day

751
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,350
if you have if you don't have the

752
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:10,700
deposit insurance scheme at European

753
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:12,709
level then in extreme extreme cases you

754
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,950
can arrived a situation that finally the

755
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:18,950
domestic budget is still responsible for

756
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:21,559
and is obliged to pay out the hundred

757
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:24,770
thousand euros for the depositors in

758
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,110
case of a huge bank if the new system

759
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:29,418
could be put in place I think that the

760
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:33,110
whole picture the whole structure as

761
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:35,090
banking Union would be finished but it's

762
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,610
not on the agenda for the time being we

763
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:41,090
are open to that but decision will be

764
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:43,580
made later it's not to my detector

765
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:46,250
public any intention to obtain to the

766
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:48,290
banking Union or you don't know I think

767
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:52,220
that it will be closely connected with

768
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:54,290
joining the eurozone well and is the

769
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,320
question at the beginning difficult to

770
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:59,540
say now maybe it will be the daughter go

771
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,760
here or there are government prospects

772
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,700
on that to say from this side of the EU

773
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,389
very very positive to hear this but I

774
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:10,668
stood as to do research I think that we

775
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,740
are the second country which you join

776
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:14,270
yeah i know i saw know that the the

777
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,888
ratings are coming up which are becoming

778
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:19,040
a bit more representative probably we

779
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:21,619
can change the screen we time is over

780
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,429
but i want to see whether it is one last

781
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:28,399
question a brief question on the issues

782
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:30,440
which we discussed ok the rating is up

783
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,489
again the the pole again I mean which I

784
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,679
would expect from my perspective

785
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:35,750
certainly for the first Poland being I

786
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,760
hope it is representative certainly the

787
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,350
first bet was not representative but

788
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,530
this one looks a bit more representative

789
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,580
but I don't know you have to see from

790
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,190
your perspective whether it's

791
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,639
effectively czech republic or hungry but

792
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:55,909
anyhow it's nice to see denmark above

793
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:58,400
hungry that is interesting so is run off

794
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:05,510
further questions I would like to thank

795
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:07,010
the three speakers miskova mr. ooh sorry

796
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:09,500
I forgot your name

797
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:12,230
Bergrin and mr. less safe for this a

798
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,910
very interesting panel I recall three

799
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,730
points which I would like to give to you

800
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,700
as my conclusions what I found extremely

801
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,050
important for us to note eurozone

802
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,299
membership is no longer automatic as we

803
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:25,250
discussed so we have new implicit

804
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,770
criteria new criteria which have come in

805
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,480
in addition we do not longer make it

806
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,759
really automatic as it's written in the

807
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,200
treaty it will be a political decision

808
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,170
which will have to be taken on both

809
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,529
sides second issue which i would like to

810
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:42,470
stress and again as I said when I open

811
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,910
this panel I come here I pick up new

812
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:45,859
things or things which I don't feel

813
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,960
enough in Brussels I have felt that

814
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,540
again the integrity of the EU is

815
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,550
extremely important it's not only the EU

816
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,680
as being the eurozone which is sometimes

817
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,460
certainly stressed a lot if you're in

818
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:00,589
the midst of the EU or certainly in the

819
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,480
capital of the orsay the main place of

820
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:06,970
the European institutions we shouldn't

821
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,970
think only about eurozone but about us

822
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,080
sure
