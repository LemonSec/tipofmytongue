guests the ax ladies and gentlemen their

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,959
panelist dear friends I would like to

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:18,810
welcome you all thank you for coming and

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,920
joining us for this panel I'm sure

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,130
discussion is going to be very

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,080
interesting and at the beginning I would

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,109
like to invite you to vote also for our

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,720
question so please please comment on

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,420
that one let me start also with the

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,989
first introductory remark regarding

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,239
industry 4.0 or smart industry as we

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,980
also used to call it traditional

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,040
businesses traditional business models

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,459
and industry will need to adapt and

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,100
transform actually two new digital era

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,949
the this process of transport

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,070
transformation and adoption is often

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,218
call as for industrial revolution it

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,250
comes after the steam after the electric

21
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,820
power and it would be dominated by the

22
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,680
power of ICT and Internet of Things I

23
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,509
think the success of implementing this

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,850
concept would be crucial would be

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,590
critical for industries all around the

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,229
world for the productivity for the

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,150
efficiency so I'm have very happy that

28
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,789
actually I have experts who will discuss

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,810
their experience on this issue with us

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,549

53
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,409
the four gentlemen mr. at Isla Danny

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,969
business Kyra develop a solid state

58
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,700
storage system for scale of cloud and

59
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:29,858
enterprise data centers thank you for

60
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,439
making this trip can be here with us

61
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:35,349
today I would like to kick off actually

62
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:36,489
the debate with more general question to

63
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,369
which i assume we will have a different

64
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,719
different approaches do you believe

65
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,000
actually that the digital transformation

66
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,799
to industry 4.0 is crucial for our

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,349
industries do you believe that this

68
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:49,329
process is necessary for us to be more

69
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:52,328
competitiveness more competitive and

70
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:59,200
more efficient may I stay with mr.

71
00:02:52,329 --> 00:03:02,470
Kapadia one issue that i want to just

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,619
bring on for and i can i guess that's a

73
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:09,489
part of just the backdrop that the

74
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:12,909
industry is struggling in many ways and

75
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,099
the issue today is that there is a

76
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:18,608
complexity in the system there's

77
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:21,310
volatility whether you're whatever part

78
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:23,260
of the supply chain you are in you are

79
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,829
not very sure of what the demand is

80
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:29,349
going to be the customers are demanding

81
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:32,709
a price point they're demanding some

82
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:34,720
kind of luxury that at a price price

83
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:39,549
point and then there's a government

84
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,400
which is also trying to legislate some

85
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:46,209
issues of safety some issues of

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,900
sustainability now all these are the

87
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:53,220
drivers for the manufacturing industry

88
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:57,010
to change and riding on on the change

89
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,680
basically enabling it is the digital set

90
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:03,399
up which is happening so the mega data

91
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:09,519
the data which can be now extracted from

92
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:12,340
a cloud the issues of how the machines

93
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,449
at least are now talking to each other

94
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,880
they have been for a while where a CNC

95
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:21,549
system can have a closed loop you can

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,150
you can produce components which are of

97
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:28,330
quality but the issue

98
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,150
means is that how soon there is going to

99
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,960
happen so there is a lot of work in

100
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,659
progress this is going to be something

101
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,409
that each manufacturing industry will

102
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:44,229
have to contend with that's a given and

103
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:46,690
with that given what needs to get done

104
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:49,210
is that you need to understand it fully

105
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,830
and holistically and make it into a

106
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,310
business plan rather than trying to

107
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:59,169
attempt it in a microwave so that would

108
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:02,020
be my first response to this that it is

109
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,880
going to touch each and every part of

110
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,729
the manufacturing industry sooner than

111
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,659
later and there has to be a preparation

112
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:13,719
for it which needs to cut the hype out

113
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,650
of industry four-point-oh and make it

114
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,240
more deployable in a way that balances

115
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:23,590
both the virtual world and the real

116
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,349
world Thank You mr. dimma maybe from

117
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,539
more you buy the perspective do you

118
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:30,219
think actually that already companies

119
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,320
are taking an advantage are taking the

120
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:39,190
opportunity actually that industry 40

121
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:42,580
brings the question is not if we have

122
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,860
the chance to choose between doing it or

123
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,520
doing involved because it's actually

124
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,229
already going on and as you know as a

125
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,659
German automotive industry our video is

126
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:56,260
representing as well a manufacturer's s

127
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:58,960
suppliers we are fully globalized and we

128
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,419
are in a quite tough global competition

129
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,719
so the competition is demanding that

130
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:10,750
anyway I think that's that the whole

131
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:14,710
story has two parts the one is the whole

132
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:17,050
issue on production and I think in terms

133
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,620
of connected production in terms of

134
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,870
Internet of Things in terms of parts

135
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,650
talking to machines in terms of

136
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:29,710
supervising logistic chains the

137
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,409
automotive industry in Europe you can

138
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:36,880
say is quite advanced I think we are

139
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:38,740
quite a driver in that matter and then

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,229
we have the other part and that's

141
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,380
product because also the auto itself

142
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:47,830
will be connected it is already going on

143
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:52,539
as most of you as customers is you might

144
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:56,169
know we are talking about connected

145
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:59,800
driving which means assisting but we are

146
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:03,729
also talking about a huge issue on what

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,090
is happening with data have cameras

148
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:09,818
sensors and everything a lot of

149
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,280
possibilities are there that's why new

150
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,680
competitors are coming into the car or

151
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,840
trying to come into the car now like the

152
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,210
famous googles and apples and so on and

153
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,270
that's also why the car industry is

154
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:25,508
actually working together with them and

155
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,060
this requires also I think a new and I

156
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,449
mean software engineers are one of the

157
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,930
most wanted people in also in the

158
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:41,610
automotive industry nowadays and on the

159
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:44,650
second part you can see that very new

160
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,830
models of working together are coming up

161
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:52,659
so three manufacturers for example are

162
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:55,539
buying for 1.5 billion euros and a

163
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:59,620
digital mapping company like Nokia here

164
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:02,349
they just did Daimler BMW and Audi I

165
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:06,340
mean that's in the German automotive

166
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,650
industry the most hardest competitors in

167
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:11,349
the market so but they have to work

168
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,690
together on this because they don't want

169
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:16,690
to let the field the googles and the

170
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,669
apples only and that's why they have to

171
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,210
do that because otherwise there will be

172
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:24,880
no chance to to gain at the end of the

173
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,310
day also new business models it's very

174
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,870
true actually I would like to start with

175
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,340
mr. rosina but then you know we have

176
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,500
experience from all over the world from

177
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,819
us and from India the automotive sector

178
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,070
is to be said that is actually

179
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,500
benefiting the most from from concept of

180
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,209
industry 4.0 what is your experience do

181
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,669
you actually already feel the impact of

182
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,709
smart industry or Internet of Things and

183
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,600
then maybe i will also like to invite

184
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:48,160
you on to have discussion between

185
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,110
yourself because you have experience as

186
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,230
i said from india from us all around the

187
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,230
world

188
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:51,520
as you hear what's going on in the

189
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:58,530
automotive world there is still the

190
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:58,530
tires States America agrees you

191
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:12,620
the digital revolution is going on

192
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,620
communication is missing nothing worse

193
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,510
though okay I destroyed you okay but I

194
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,960
think I don't have to repeat it to you

195
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:24,650
ever a very good yeah yeah so so after

196
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,279
the a few years of experience I can tell

197
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,170
you that's really the impact of

198
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,970
implementation of 40 and it is not

199
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,740
possible to speak about impact only in

200
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,300
terms of Slovakia because really an

201
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,240
automotive sector is a very

202
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:41,469
international sector one and we are one

203
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,950
of many kilowatts here in Slovakia and

204
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:48,380
these three of the three of the

205
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:52,250
production scheme now in the present

206
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:54,920
time is like from OEM throughout tier

207
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:59,500
one producer Steve to and clear the next

208
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:03,319
steps this way it is a very white

209
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,420
question if we have spoken with some

210
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,820
experts what are the economical

211
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,880
expectations because yeah all the guys

212
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,980
we can take some documentation with us

213
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,370
an expectation is maybe in the figures

214
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:20,450
after the successful implementation of

215
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,190
industry for point systems is maybe the

216
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:27,040
reduction or growth of productivity

217
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:31,400
about fifty percent which is a huge huge

218
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,949
step forward for a future and also is a

219
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:37,520
big challenge for all of us for example

220
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:40,670
the reduction of this of the staff of

221
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:45,380
the sources let's say about the forty

222
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:48,170
percent maintenance costs we expect may

223
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:52,100
do make all over then maybe about by

224
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:56,810
thirty percent it is really also a huge

225
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:59,990
number of money and not quality a cost

226
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,180
maybe about a twenty percent reduction I

227
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,279
just took a cost about the Danny person

228
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,920
also direction is forecasted and

229
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:09,829
basically the a production costs also

230
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:12,349
all in it at all the production we

231
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,930
expect about many person which is a

232
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,529
really

233
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:19,109
a huge challenge for all of us and in

234
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:21,480
automotive industry is only one way how

235
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,750
to become how to make the business

236
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,820
sustainable in this triad which means

237
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,240
this is already quite a big competition

238
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:33,690
between the American cars now nowadays

239
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,950
you can see some information war let's

240
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:39,870
say and some some slope of information

241
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,390
about some some problems with the legs

242
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,600
house with the pollution of those those

243
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:48,089
things european cars are in my point of

244
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,580
view on the technical point of view on a

245
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,459
highest level now and what is our target

246
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,300
but what should be our aim to keep the

247
00:12:53,459 --> 00:13:00,089
advantage of european car producers the

248
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:02,699
let's say hi tech level of cars which we

249
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:05,100
have still and the third asian part also

250
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,440
is fighting very hardly and now those

251
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:11,700
three words are mixing all together and

252
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,459
now i think is on place certain question

253
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,600
about some standardization how to

254
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:21,420
maintain some some rules also for a

255
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,490
moment on things for example and those

256
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,310
those those things which means there are

257
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:29,870
many liars if you like to speak about

258
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:33,810
about the implementation of industry 4.0

259
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:36,120
but basically it is ongoing process we

260
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,099
are in and we have to really implement

261
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,190
it throughout the action plan is lavaca

262
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,480
very fast it's very very first you would

263
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,420
love to be part of that and work on it

264
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,850
with you mr. Daniel can you share with

265
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,990
us your view from from also us birth us

266
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:55,470
perspective but being Slovak so

267
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:59,430
basically I've you basically any new

268
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:02,070
technology and IOT or industry 4.0 is

269
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,260
basically another wave actually has two

270
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,540
components you know there are new

271
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,189
opportunities which is additional

272
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,380
services and business you should be

273
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,020
generated and and you know people

274
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,880
employed that's the additive component

275
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,770
but very significant is subtractive

276
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,370
components means if you don't have it

277
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:23,100
you will be losing existing markets you

278
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:25,500
know we should we should remember that

279
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,450
you know everybody from us has things

280
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,490
like

281
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:33,050
smart phone and not even ten years ago

282
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:37,640
because the European manufacturer was

283
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,250
the Nokia yet Sony Ericsson and suddenly

284
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,330
I t technology or compute came to the

285
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:48,080
phone and today people are not buying

286
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:50,630
the phones because you know it's it's

287
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,460
nokia zone but because of the services

288
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,430
and applications what do you have to

289
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:59,630
them so we saw how disruptive the

290
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:03,079
changes are and if you don't adapt to

291
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:05,689
new industrial wave basically your

292
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,240
production will be reduced so so there

293
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,550
are two aspects subtractive that if you

294
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,230
don't participate or you are late you

295
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,839
will lose the business and therefore

296
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,050
there is no choice and you have to

297
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:21,530
participate and the second aspect is

298
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,430
additive where new services will be

299
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:29,380
built you know all these revolutions are

300
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:32,569
effectively platforms you know the new

301
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,439
you know smartphones are other platforms

302
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,880
that people can plug in ideas

303
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,100
innovations application create new

304
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:46,370
services which was not possible before

305
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:49,640
and I see industry 1.4 as the platform

306
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,920
that is for example car which will have

307
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,220
some compute copper copper capability

308
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,790
and it will create all many services

309
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:03,370
from mapping optimizations and another

310
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:05,780
services because imagine you know

311
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,760
optimal will be evolved to self driving

312
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:12,020
and now you'll be sitting in your car

313
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:15,319
instead driving for our basically an

314
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,140
hour doing nothing which people will

315
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,240
don't do nothing so we'd mean eating

316
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,160
that within that hour sitting in the car

317
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,100
you will be probably consuming new media

318
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,439
or or doing some work and it will

319
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:33,329
completely change the dynamics so so

320
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,899
industry one point 4.0 is happening

321
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:40,888
and we have done don't have luxury to

322
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:43,019
not participate Thank You mr. Kapoor iya

323
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:45,149
being also a policy analyst our policy

324
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,980
advisor what do you think what would it

325
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,470
impact actually on the labor market and

326
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,809
maybe also the trend of relocating

327
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,429
production to low-wage countries how

328
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:55,819
shall we as a representative of

329
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:59,249
government also adapts to this trend I

330
00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:01,979
think like first the acceptance is that

331
00:16:59,249 --> 00:17:06,110
this is a reality which is going to

332
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:10,559
happen and one of the largest issues

333
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:14,069
would be the skill base and the human

334
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:17,398
interface is drastically going to change

335
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:23,069
and for that what would be required

336
00:17:17,398 --> 00:17:25,579
required is that the today the normal or

337
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,590
the what you think is the workforce

338
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:32,820
would not be the same workforce going

339
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:35,279
forward so there's a huge amount of

340
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,340
effort which needs to have makers to

341
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,399
recognize this and start rescaling and

342
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,769
it's it's not easy because it's easier

343
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:46,049
said than done because you have to have

344
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:49,049
kind of technologies which are going to

345
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:51,570
interplay and thus to interface in a

346
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:54,960
value-add process is is going to be a

347
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:58,950
Charlie cos need to take cognizance off

348
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,059
is the way manufacturing is happening

349
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:06,059
all over the as a linear chain anymore

350
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:09,418
it's now a network so whatever product

351
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:12,480
just showed the phone and and we all

352
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:14,010
know that how how iphone is assembled

353
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,340
where it is assembled and where the

354
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:19,590
value is kept the thought process and

355
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,090
the engineering is happening in other

356
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:28,620
geography and thus there is a total

357
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:30,629
integration of this through networks so

358
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,029
the so the boundary is the geography

359
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,950
chol boundaries and even political

360
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,980
boundaries are being crossed back and

361
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,490
forth and that is a recognition that

362
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:45,210
each of the policymaker needs to have

363
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:46,770
and facilitate so let's look at an auto

364
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,600
and i'll give my own

365
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:52,260
example from my own company because we

366
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,080
supply to damla through the through the

367
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:59,810
world certain transmission components

368
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:05,189
and some of these components move to

369
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:09,090
Germany they are then processed may be

370
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,920
assembled in that or another geography

371
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,159
like it the component could very much

372
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:18,300
come from that place to even to Slovakia

373
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:20,460
get assembled and move back to some

374
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,270
geography which is which it is getting

375
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,540
sold and and then finally there would be

376
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:32,220
a servicing part which would which would

377
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:35,389
happen so once we recognize that the

378
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,460
boundaries are going to be crossed and

379
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,650
these supply chains are now

380
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:43,880
boundary-less then you have to have

381
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:46,080
trade facilitation which sort of takes

382
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,410
cognizance of it and actually

383
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,889
facilitates it rather than become

384
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:56,490
restrictive so I'm not talking about

385
00:19:52,890 --> 00:20:00,000
that the you know EU as a block but

386
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:03,690
across geographies that means you know

387
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,570
there are there are larger larger mega

388
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:10,050
blocks which are also in play like you

389
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:12,720
know TPP and TTIP so all that also needs

390
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:15,389
to be taken into cognizance that how

391
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,540
these components are going to flow

392
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,370
besides of course the data and today

393
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,850
governments are talking about how to

394
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:27,209
channelize that how to regulate it so

395
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:29,909
regulatory mechanisms are will have to

396
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:33,750
be in sync with industry four-point-oh

397
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:36,600
and along with this will have to be in

398
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:39,570
sync the human element that means the

399
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:44,850
rescaling so at one end the governance

400
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:47,850
of putting in the the basic rules of the

401
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:51,360
game and the governance around that and

402
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:54,090
for the for the policymakers would also

403
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,639
be to how to rescale the human element

404
00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:00,110
because they need to be rescaled not

405
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,540
that they're going to they are it's it's

406
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,689
I think in all economies whether they

407
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,700
emerging economies or advanced economies

408
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:12,320
each government is struggling for to

409
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:15,440
create jobs so in that sense better

410
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,178
start sooner than later thank you very

411
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,559
much mr. Lima maybe from the Brussels

412
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:21,230
point of view do you think the browser

413
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,690
is actually ready to not maybe regulate

414
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:28,970
but to deregulate and to support in the

415
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:30,650
industry 4.0 in this regard a lot of

416
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:35,570
things were said already and I would

417
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:42,799
like to add two remarks on this question

418
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:46,428
of how can we keep our value chains in a

419
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,470
changing world first example we have the

420
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:51,520
same issue actually on another field

421
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:54,350
which is connected that's the feel of

422
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,660
electromobility everybody is talking

423
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,639
about ich ours especially in Brussels

424
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,950
it's when it comes to emissions when it

425
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,280
comes to see you too it's a huge issue

426
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:06,770
our problem and we have those cars on

427
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:11,200
the market our problem is batteries are

428
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:15,770
basically produced in Asia not in Europe

429
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,380
so that means in an e car you don't need

430
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:22,639
an engine combustion engine you don't

431
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,500
need a gearbox you don't need a emission

432
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,770
cleaning systems at all and a lot of

433
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:31,520
other parts which are in our value chain

434
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:33,620
are not needed in any car anymore so the

435
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,100
question for politicians always has to

436
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:39,678
be i think in europe if you force an

437
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,389
industry into different technologies

438
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,150
what they actually doing for example

439
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:47,720
when they do co2 regulations then you

440
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,820
always have to be very careful what you

441
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,720
are doing to existing value chains or

442
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:56,899
are we having tools to be part of this

443
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:59,150
competition in new value chains and

444
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,919
there of course in the last panel that

445
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,260
was debate discussed the young younger

446
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,390
plan and investment plans for example

447
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:08,240
there are some tools which create

448
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:10,880
possibilities are we able to create a

449
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,860
battery cluster or some battery clusters

450
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,590
in Europe for example with the next

451
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,469
generation

452
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:19,740
batteries coming to connectivity again

453
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:23,340
the same issue yet alone mascara yeah

454
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:26,309
right well yeah that's at least his

455
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,610
money actually that's true but coming to

456
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,840
connectivity it's the same issue

457
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:33,809
everybody has navigation systems

458
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:38,789
nowadays in his new cars they are run by

459
00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:40,408
GPS GPS is American I'm in Europe in

460
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:42,840
Brussels now for 10 years we are

461
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:46,830
discussing the Galileo project for 10

462
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:50,209
years now this is actually a measure

463
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:55,799
where European value chain could be

464
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:58,830
created also force by politics why has

465
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:03,379
to be there only American data clouds

466
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:03,379
why do they have to be only with Google

467
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,240
if we have a digital single market which

468
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,830
we are discussing in the margin moment

469
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:17,130
which i think is key for these issues we

470
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:21,120
have to think about own standards and

471
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:24,090
own capability to be part of these value

472
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,649
chains I think that is what politicians

473
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,350
can do and at the end of the day I mean

474
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:33,479
it's clear for for the industry the the

475
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:36,689
challenge is how can we keep value

476
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,260
chains together I mean the big success I

477
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:42,690
think at least of the German automotive

478
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,480
industry which is in reality when you

479
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:48,390
come to to Slovakia when you go to

480
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,370
Hungaria when you go to Spain when you

481
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,100
go to czech republic in fact it's a

482
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:55,889
European automotive industry when it

483
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,490
comes to production that the success is

484
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:01,830
the close contact between suppliers the

485
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,840
closed network between suppliers and

486
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:07,379
manufacturers how can we keep that

487
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,939
together and also take into account new

488
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,480
players in the field because they will

489
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,250
comes last remark we have we are every

490
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:19,549
two years doing the frankfurt motor show

491
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:23,429
that's one of our one of our biggest

492
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:25,660
things we are doing we had a new

493
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:30,070
mobility world which was a

494
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:33,790
a complete halt only with companies and

495
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,169
people which has four with our eyes

496
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:38,260
nothing to do with the automotive

497
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:41,530
industry in the past like Google's like

498
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:44,110
apples like Siemens for example coming

499
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:47,740
back like a lot of startups being

500
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:50,290
dealing with issues digital issues on

501
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,760
the transport sector they are interested

502
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,230
now in our motor show because they are

503
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,570
connected to the car they want to go

504
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,880
into the car and we somehow have to

505
00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:01,389
welcome them and deal with them my thing

506
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:04,830
is I just need to take Alice this point

507
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:07,510
if I may yeah sure yeah because you know

508
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,550
what i was talking about dissolution of

509
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:12,700
borders and here you are talking about

510
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:15,310
resurrecting them so is that the way

511
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,880
forward because i don't think the world

512
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:22,030
is moving in that direction of obviously

513
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,800
the the the politicians are challenged

514
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:27,850
as well because they need to preserve

515
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,980
their domains but as industry i think

516
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:33,750
bringing down the barriers whether

517
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,750
whatever we I mean picnic

518
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,510
you
