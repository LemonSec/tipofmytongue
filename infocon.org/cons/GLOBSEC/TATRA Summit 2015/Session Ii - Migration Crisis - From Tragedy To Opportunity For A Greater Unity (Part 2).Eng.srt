1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,649
the debate and situation and at least in

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,000
my case I'm a member of the European

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,969
People's Party family which is the

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,250
biggest yeah Donald Tusk and jean-claude

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,710
Juncker sits at the same table and we

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:22,350
meet in Brussels next time in December

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:25,170
and I I shared with many with people

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,650
like Nicolas Sarkozy who is back at the

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,349
table from France that to start with

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:36,089
quota as the beginning of the answer or

11
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:40,680
the system was wrong was not not a good

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:45,270
beginning but to deal now with the

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,820
situation seriously and and really is a

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,039
must for all individually for countries

15
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,050
and also for for the community central

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,920
europe has different history i'm happy

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,718
you use durham central for decades I had

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,879
to oppose we are Eastern year we are

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,149
noticed Eastern Europe there is western

20
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,459
central eastern there is European mosaic

21
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,990
of a different countries different

22
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,100
regions different languages different

23
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:15,330
cultures Europe is very old nice and and

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,089
valued valued or precious diversity in

25
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,340
unity and Central Europe means something

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,590
in in the center something what was a

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,369
better field between big powers in the

28
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,950
past during the century of fears century

29
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:35,189
of fears it's it's it's a notion of

30
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:39,150
ilium that's an important now I come to

31
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:45,649
this it is something where these

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:51,240
countries were part of ethnic purchase

33
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:55,409
when more totalitarian time has has

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,890
flown than freedom very limited decades

35
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:03,049
of democratic experience now we have 25

36
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,049
years of freedom it's one generation one

37
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:09,199
university life mean

38
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,760
a new experience with freedom

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:17,190
responsibility common Europe and all

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:23,780
these are key and multicultural society

41
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:28,020
around but also my response was if not

42
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:31,680
compulsory quota but but functioning and

43
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,480
responsible solidarity because

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,760
solidarity is something which must be

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,340
based more on people-to-people

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,870
relationship than bureaucratic or

47
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,700
administrative relationship and this

48
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,670
response in my spectrum in my party is

49
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,329
is there I oppose my prime minister to

50
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,149
see European Union because of quarters

51
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,770
it's something dubious and this term was

52
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:59,100
used by the member of the government of

53
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,800
Slovakia I agree it's dubious for

54
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,930
domestic reasons there is a lot of

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,930
politics in in the situation there is

56
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,540
there is a lot of calculation today and

57
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,060
I am against the calculation because it

58
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,280
is about so in your own money but people

59
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,180
now they are dealing and and we are

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,600
ready to do to show and share solidarity

61
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,570
so you think that it's Slovakia should

62
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,519
accept in fact the mandatory quota even

63
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,769
though that was the wrong starting point

64
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,230
it was wrong starting point and Slovakia

65
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,660
should claim the rule of law is

66
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,929
important in Slovakia for slovakia in

67
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,820
europe for europe yeah if legal expert

68
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,700
says that rule of law is not good

69
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,609
because majority then i'm against some

70
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,359
taxation laws in slovakia which is which

71
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:51,630
were not reasonable and are against

72
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,880
economic growth in this country but i

73
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,030
have to observe majority and legislation

74
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,980
which is valid so is it in your eyes is

75
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,650
it acceptable for a member state of the

76
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,920
european union to limit their refugee

77
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,430
intake save to christians look as i am

78
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,660
white no no asylum procedure is based on

79
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,580
strict rules and and we are we are

80
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,769
country which observes international and

81
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,070
national legislation it's not based on

82
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:24,760
religion or race yeah so I oppose this

83
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,040
approach for future for long term for

84
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,260
integration of course there are

85
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,230
significant sensitivities but this is

86
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,020
not issue of asylum seeking an asylum

87
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,300
treatment no well but he will come to

88
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,049
that in the next round a final political

89
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,720
question and then we'll move on how do

90
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:48,280
you perceive the role of Angela Merkel

91
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:52,260
in this crisis has she been throwing her

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,150
weight around too much has she been

93
00:04:52,260 --> 00:05:00,520
creating problems for others or has she

94
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:03,039
been showing moral leadership or all of

95
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,469
the above simple question but not so

96
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,960
simple situation and answer if I

97
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,500
mentioned constitutional crisis economic

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,229
and financial and I know what it was

99
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,200
inside and I both there when anger

100
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,400
miracle replaced garage shredder I was

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,390
in the Commission in crow this

102
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:27,250
commission and in burrows she brought a

103
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:30,250
lot of pro-european commitment balanced

104
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:35,470
approach reserved a smaller states it

105
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:41,590
was not kind of curatorial or or direct

106
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:45,940
aureum against the rest and I think she

107
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,789
helped significantly decisively to

108
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:52,290
address constitutional crisis economic

109
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:57,060
and financial nothing is perfect nobody

110
00:05:52,290 --> 00:06:00,040
nobody is perfect and her role was

111
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:05,740
unreplaceable in those years and decayed

112
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:08,710
on on on this sort of situation I would

113
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:13,060
say the messages from largest European

114
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:18,460
EU country on readiness to absorb to

115
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:20,260
accept up to 800,000 refugees message is

116
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,200
spread very easily and swiftly

117
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,270
throughout an outside continent meant

118
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,280
for example that in Syria and Syria or

119
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,490
in

120
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,289
she comes most of people think and

121
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:37,820
believe that they are welcomed and

122
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:41,940
expected in Europe or in Germany and I

123
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:46,889
hope that in Germany now after sunday CD

124
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:52,410
and CSU and SPD miracle and they

125
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:56,130
affirmed and Gabrielle will be able to

126
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,919
keep on going and to address steps which

127
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:04,740
are necessary now otherwise without

128
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:07,229
Germany without consolidated approach we

129
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:09,540
shall not consolidate situation together

130
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:12,330
and I think that consolidation of the

131
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:16,590
situation is a base for credibility of

132
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:18,180
Europe at intra and add extra and it

133
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,080
will not go with our German government

134
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,130
led by or now led by Angela Merkel but

135
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,870
there may have been an error in

136
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:29,900
communication in the way angular Merkel

137
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:32,760
communicated to the Syrian refugees the

138
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,390
willingness to there is always there is

139
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,890
always a lot of simplification

140
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:43,070
propaganda misuse by for example illegal

141
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:45,419
traffickers yeah bari by organized crime

142
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:48,090
we got a question about organized crime

143
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:52,380
comes out in a second I wanted to ask

144
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:53,969
first Monica venome will the refugees

145
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:58,020
pay for our pensions and our welfare

146
00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:00,419
systems yes for four-day parts but the

147
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:04,049
integration is the kind of her the key

148
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:07,890
word as I said already earlier and in

149
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:11,390
certain countries sir there are areas

150
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:15,780
where countries have difficulties to get

151
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:19,740
employees so in in certain countries in

152
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:22,619
certain areas it really can be of help

153
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,250
when more people come to the country but

154
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,350
but really what is important is that we

155
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:31,229
can't look at the immigrants or refugees

156
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:33,780
as one group because they have different

157
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:36,539
origins different skills different

158
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,490
backgrounds so and that actually makes

159
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,020
the integration process very challenging

160
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,799
because you need

161
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:47,490
tailored measures so for some of them

162
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:50,300
you need to improve the basic kills but

163
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,040
actually the amount of highly educated

164
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,170
immigrants and refugees have increased

165
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,560
during their years and we have to take

166
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:02,310
care add that there is not either brain

167
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,579
waste which is happening actually now so

168
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:09,060
if we invest in them now then in the

169
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:11,730
long run they will help to pay off yes

170
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:15,000
exactly works s we have to think of it

171
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:18,000
as an investment but bit when it comes

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,820
to this brain waste one interesting

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,150
figure is that when we look at the well

174
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:28,920
educated immigrants who have they

175
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:31,829
decrease from foreign universities so

176
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,680
forty-two percent of them work in a

177
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,750
lower skilled jobs than what education

178
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,579
so we're not taking enough advantage yes

179
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,760
and but when it comes to those

180
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:44,700
immigrants who have they decreased from

181
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,600
the domestic University they're only

182
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:51,330
twenty-two percent of them work in jobs

183
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,420
with where the requirements are lower

184
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:58,140
than what their education so they lot

185
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:01,229
lot to be done and in order also to look

186
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,270
at a kind of the transparency when it

187
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:05,310
comes to decrease of course in every

188
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:09,000
country have to be sure that a decree

189
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:13,140
which you have has the same level as say

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,050
you have in your country but I think the

191
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,420
system is not functioning properly when

192
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,339
you hear these figures that's certainly

193
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,920
something to bear in mind Kathy you want

194
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,440
to come in on that I just think there is

195
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,079
there is certainly scope for changing

196
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,650
the narrative into a lot more was it a

197
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,410
lot more positive one not only the OECD

198
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:38,100
research but a number of other studies

199
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:41,040
and research show that there is one area

200
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,750
we haven't talked about yet there is one

201
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,880
area of public policy that's the most

202
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,870
predictable of all and that's demography

203
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,019
and this is a continent where the labor

204
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:56,459
is shrinking which especially

205
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:59,399
in Central Europe as an would certainly

206
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:03,118
agree the demographic projections are

207
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:05,429
very dire and so you have you have a

208
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:09,149
pool you will have to look for a pool of

209
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:11,160
labor in the next 10 15 20 years in our

210
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,980
in this very country and in all the

211
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,639
countries around it and in many parts of

212
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:20,040
Europe so that's this one real sort of

213
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,049
driver that should that should push for

214
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,230
integration but the other the other

215
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:27,029
aspect is that the people who come here

216
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,600
and it doesn't matter whether they come

217
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:34,110
from a poor background in Africa or

218
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,569
whether they are fleeing Syria and you

219
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,399
know Aleppo they the one thing that

220
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,779
unifies them and I agree that they have

221
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,369
diverse backgrounds but the one thing

222
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:44,399
that unifies them is the day are

223
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:46,170
risk-takers they have drive and hence

224
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,749
they are much more likely to be

225
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,199
entrepreneurial right so is the is the

226
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:55,110
best and brightest that that you that go

227
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:59,248
and take the dangerous journey to make

228
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:02,429
it here so I think that they can if if

229
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:05,220
the policies are done well and if the if

230
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:08,100
the countries use the integration

231
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,049
capacity that they may have because it's

232
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,699
not the financial is not a logistical

233
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:14,189
challenge at these numbers it's

234
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:17,069
certainly not it's a mental challenge

235
00:12:14,189 --> 00:12:19,679
and is an integration challenge and if

236
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,899
it's if it's done well they could

237
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,809
contribute to making the societies

238
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,809
diverse and hence more resilient in this

239
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:31,019
new era of exponential tea and global

240
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:33,509
developments that are hard to adapt to

241
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,879
and if you have a society that's more

242
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:39,419
diverse it's going to be more deductible

243
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:41,129
almost by definition bacuna so you say I

244
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:42,779
just wanted to say that there of course

245
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:45,809
we are not either saying that this is a

246
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:47,819
kind of a nice story everybody wins that

247
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:51,029
is not the case of course if the

248
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:54,839
integration doesn't kind of if we don't

249
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:56,669
succeed in that also certain groups in

250
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:59,279
those countries where a lot of

251
00:12:56,669 --> 00:13:01,230
immigrants and also refugees come and

252
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,640
especially when it comes to low-skilled

253
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,690
jobs the native-born good

254
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,970
in lots worse position so I think

255
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:13,490
information delivering is kind of the

256
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,160
key and also we have to be able to

257
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:19,160
deliver all that information which is

258
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,459
not so nice yeah I was going to come to

259
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,100
that that there are losers of

260
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:29,150
immigration and that's the same whether

261
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:32,230
they're refugees or economic migrants or

262
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:34,699
whatever and those tend to be the people

263
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,360
at the bottom of the pile in our own

264
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:41,540
societies what used to be called the

265
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,180
white working class and they are the

266
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,300
people who are first of all losers from

267
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:51,079
globalization in general because they've

268
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:56,719
been priced out of jobs by imports but

269
00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:00,380
also specifically competitors for public

270
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:05,060
spending on housing schooling health

271
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:09,980
care and social benefits with the new

272
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:12,229
arrivals and who I here in Germany to

273
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:13,820
some extent I no fair yura gasps misson

274
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,280
is still around or whether he's had to

275
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:21,200
leave us but one hear stories from

276
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:23,420
Germany that of German working-class

277
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,200
people saying you know all of this money

278
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:31,400
all is being spent on accommodating the

279
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,570
refugees what about us so I think that's

280
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,480
certainly something we need to think

281
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,220
about sorry there's you had point mate I

282
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,720
can also speak to that because I think

283
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,720
that's it that's something we're under

284
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,730
estimating at the moment hey I you know

285
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,170
welcome positive narrative swords

286
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,360
migration but I think we should be very

287
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:50,300
careful about too closely linking

288
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,180
economic benefits to refugee populations

289
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,339
as a driver for welcoming war there is

290
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:59,750
an international legal responsibility

291
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:01,580
yeah to protect those in need of

292
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,830
protection regardless of their economic

293
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,200
costs and benefits so you know we have

294
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,030
to keep that as that as the headline and

295
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,220
I think the second reason to sort of be

296
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,839
very careful about this is there's been

297
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,750
a lot of talk over the last few months

298
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,390
of you know there's the Syrian engineers

299
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,010
are Syrian doctors this is how

300
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:20,110
tastic we need these people and that's

301
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:22,420
great as long as you're Syrian

302
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,310
engineering qualification is recognized

303
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,930
in the country you arrived in right and

304
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,969
one of the major challenges for us over

305
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,859
the next decade and this is particularly

306
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:32,170
challenge for Germany which has a quite

307
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:35,260
a rigid labor market and recognition

308
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,360
system is how do you manage to recognize

309
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,069
that qualification and or create the

310
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,780
kind of bridging programs and skills

311
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,940
development programs that will

312
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,339
facilitate access to the labor market at

313
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,140
the right level and one of the ways to

314
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,120
think about this is not just investment

315
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,310
in recognition of qualifications but

316
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,530
also skills development programs that

317
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,239
look at coastal populations Native

318
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,569
communities as well as new refugee

319
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,920
communities and thinking about that sort

320
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,290
of investment for the whole community

321
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,959
and population and here i think that

322
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,760
there's completely an underserved role

323
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,230
for private sector actors get well

324
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,990
that's certainly a message that we would

325
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:13,090
want to to pass on to your gazz misson

326
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,360
who in his day job is deputy labor

327
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,880
minister and responsible for a lot of

328
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,340
those things we've had some questions

329
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,770
from the audience so I'd like to start

330
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,830
by taking one or two that have been sent

331
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:29,500
in anonymously and then ask some real

332
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:32,830
members of the audience to give us their

333
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,640
questions and comments but first of all

334
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:38,950
as peripheral EU states what role can

335
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:43,480
croatia Romania Bulgaria play as

336
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:46,300
positive influences for you desire z you

337
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,170
wishes in the Western Balkans region for

338
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:53,709
example on migration catty these are

339
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,030
you're not quite your your clients

340
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,670
because they're already member states

341
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:03,699
but you used to be client there near the

342
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:06,879
clients of duty clients well I would

343
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,640
echo my neighbor here on the panel yawn

344
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,280
and say that first and foremost uphold

345
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:17,170
the uphold the icky in their own

346
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:22,660
countries and and certainly should they

347
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:27,310
become or continue be transit states you

348
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:29,950
know not not not be inclined to to be

349
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,139
closing borders etc but

350
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:35,700
are all non Schengen countries so they

351
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:40,300
are they are outside outside of the

352
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:43,980
smaller Schengen space in the Western

353
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,899
Balkans I think that ironically we are

354
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,730
slightly better equipped in providing

355
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,850
concrete support than we are inside the

356
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:53,980
EU actually through D because there is a

357
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:57,399
there is an assistance mechanism in

358
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:02,050
place yeah we were able very quickly to

359
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,150
reorient and reprogram a lot of the

360
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:06,639
assistants towards migration management

361
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,660
border management work with the host

362
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:14,290
communities in addition to the

363
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:17,140
humanitarian aid in general so we are we

364
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,510
are ironically better equipped to react

365
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,880
quickly because a lot of the lot of the

366
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,190
mechanisms for example humanitarian

367
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,750
assistance is only for outside the EU

368
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:30,970
and this crisis has shown that

369
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,410
mechanisms for quick reaction inside the

370
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,360
you may need to be developed in the

371
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,680
future as well they don't exist yet so

372
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,240
we are able to react quicker and

373
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,790
certainly the help of Bulgaria Romania

374
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,720
Croatia to the Western Balkan countries

375
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:50,409
would be very welcome because logistical

376
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:54,160
help is needed expert help is needed

377
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:56,590
material support is needed but on our

378
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,260
side on the on the US side I'll just use

379
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,929
one one example we were able to

380
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,330
reprogram 10 million euros for for

381
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:08,470
Serbia and the former yugoslav republic

382
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:10,960
of macedonia with in between adoption in

383
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,330
the commission and contracting we spent

384
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,600
only three weeks which is like lightning

385
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,540
speed for for the EU so certainly helped

386
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,290
both in terms of personnel and and money

387
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:25,810
material would be would be most welcome

388
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,399
great well the couple of issues which we

389
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,919
haven't discussed yet which are there in

390
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,680
the public and therefore reflected in

391
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,470
our audience one is concerned about

392
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:38,380
terrorism the other is concerned about

393
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:40,450
organized crime and trafficking so one

394
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,570
question which i'm going to put two

395
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:47,500
young feegle but others are welcome to

396
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:52,179
come in how do we avoid the known

397
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:55,180
phenomenon with an already mostly

398
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:57,880
integrated Muslim population that we're

399
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:01,990
some in the second generation born in

400
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,890
Europe turned to terrorism that's a

401
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:08,530
whole panel subject in itself probably

402
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,840
and the other one what link is there

403
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:14,920
between migratory human trafficking and

404
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,199
other illicit forms of trafficking is

405
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:21,030
there any discussion of the nexus

406
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:27,580
between this crisis and other security

407
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:32,460
threats yeah it's yeah it's a huge topic

408
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:37,350
calm and maybe I would started with

409
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:41,890
mentioning one book from Israeli author

410
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:44,860
almost oz how to cure a fanatic this is

411
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:48,790
the title very short small book which

412
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,820
speaks about dividing line in our lives

413
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,170
and societies it is not between

414
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:57,610
civilizations it is not between cultures

415
00:20:53,170 --> 00:21:00,840
between people basically but it goes

416
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:04,120
through our inner conscience either we

417
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:09,250
respect life with respect dignity of

418
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:12,000
everybody or not and the other side of

419
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:15,400
the line is fanaticism of any sort

420
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,240
ideological artistic political religious

421
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,490
you mean you may continue there are

422
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,620
different examples in human history and

423
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:27,850
European history especially of the

424
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:32,429
swords and waves of fanaticism and the

425
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:37,360
dough's and responses education

426
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:41,890
education education which means knowing

427
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:45,129
more and respecting more because we may

428
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:48,730
become happier in france in germany in

429
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:51,650
slovakia in relationship not isolated

430
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:57,440
not soul not

431
00:21:51,650 --> 00:22:02,000
embraced by by our other DD walls or

432
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:05,050
hand offenses and I think that this is

433
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,280
phenomenon which speaks by itself that

434
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:13,240
integration is quite demanding process

435
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,550
integration is neither absorption nor

436
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:20,150
assimilation integration means

437
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:25,460
participation as equals taking part on

438
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:29,120
the same civic human base and for that

439
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,400
we need to bring understanding of

440
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,149
minorities and majorities together or

441
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:38,530
not not to nurture parallel societies as

442
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:42,860
we frequently see but really help

443
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:45,860
children to grow together to know the

444
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:48,350
culture of the neighbor and to build up

445
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,360
neighborhood in the neighborhood not

446
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:53,179
around Europe but not where people

447
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,979
really live integration even European

448
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,920
the relation starts at home in the

449
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,470
country it goes on by a neighborhood

450
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,440
with the neighbors I am happy that visa

451
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,960
grant is something we'll is quite known

452
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,550
and it's not imposed it is something

453
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:13,610
very European in living together and

454
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:16,220
even even working together in political

455
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:20,090
terms and this is example and

456
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,730
contribution also to European policies I

457
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:27,580
think we still need to learn the best

458
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:30,170
practices to put together quality and

459
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,540
access to education as a double

460
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,280
objective not only access and then you

461
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,879
have a gal Italian system without

462
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:42,139
quality or only or so low quality and

463
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:44,120
you have a logistic system so this is

464
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:49,010
more about education and living together

465
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:50,840
this terrorism and trafficking can I

466
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,580
something because I think yeah making

467
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,709
important very briefly I can see the

468
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,439
audience is getting edgy to ask

469
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,120
questions so sick I can draw on the

470
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,280
French example when it comes to

471
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,959
integration and I think identity is very

472
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,910
important there was some research a few

473
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,920
years ago in France where they asked a

474
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,630
lot of second-generation immigrants so

475
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,970
the children of immigrants yeah do you

476
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,350
feel French very high percentage said

477
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:14,180
yes I feel French the second question

478
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,600
said do you think others think you a

479
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,880
French the number dropped so people can

480
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,919
felt French we're aware that no one else

481
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,690
in France thought of them as French and

482
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,850
the body language of the state is

483
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,250
extraordinarily important if a state

484
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,080
says you are or you are not part of us

485
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,300
you are not part of our society you are

486
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,949
in you are out that has a strong effect

487
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,020
particularly on the second generation

488
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,330
about how they feel about participating

489
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,530
in a society and we've seen that in a

490
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,780
number of countries I think we should be

491
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,670
very aware of the narratives and the

492
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:45,530
identical identity issues that are

493
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,850
involved with yes and when it comes to

494
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,530
human trafficking and smuggling and

495
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:50,659
financing we haven't looked more closely

496
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:53,210
closely enough at financing I mean there

497
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,760
are investigative journalists making

498
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,560
links between Isis and smuggling I think

499
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,720
there are your huge crossovers between

500
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:02,120
different criminal networks this is a

501
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,540
very horizontal phenomenon many people

502
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,889
are migrants themselves facilitating the

503
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,070
next stage of their journey through

504
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,690
through helping co nationals across the

505
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,580
next stage of the smuggled journey so

506
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,740
they're not necessarily smugglers there

507
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,439
are organized crime networks involved in

508
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,080
this there's a huge diversity of

509
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,030
smuggling in travel logs is this but it

510
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,490
is a huge business with high profits an

511
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:27,020
extremely low risk and if you wanted to

512
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,730
be involved in other nefarious actors

513
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,570
that barriers to entry are extremely

514
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,980
though yeah I heard mark pierini the

515
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,409
other day say that it was a

516
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:38,780
billion-dollar business now this year in

517
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,580
Turkey if you reckon that each family

518
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,480
spent on average two thousand five

519
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:47,330
hundred euros to get from Syria to

520
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,900
Europe and most of that money was going

521
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:54,220
to intermediaries in Turkey worth worth

522
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:56,270
bearing in mind right it's your turn

523
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,490
ladies and gentlemen you've been very

524
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,139
patient gentleman over there I'll take

525
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,540
sort of perhaps two or three questions

526
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,660
at a time please

527
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:08,629
yourself tell us who your question or

528
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,760
comment is for and keep it short thank

529
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,950
you melanesia it's a method and a think

530
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,960
tank from Bratislava Slovakia the

531
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,780
question is to anybody who wishes to

532
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,260
answer that and I'd like to return with

533
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:23,300
no disrespect to the people who are no

534
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,760
longer here to the previous panel and

535
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:29,750
two things intrigued me very much one

536
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:33,470
was when state secretary Asmussen spoke

537
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:37,160
about the Constitution right to claim

538
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:41,180
asylum in Germany and he always makes a

539
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,100
very precise argument and today he also

540
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,410
made a very precise argument with one

541
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,209
caveat that was that he said that the

542
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,120
right is unlimited that means that

543
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,850
there's no ceiling which i think is

544
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:55,100
constitutionally and Aristocles

545
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:56,810
praiseworthy and from the point of human

546
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:01,870
rights also praiseworthy from the point

547
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:04,610
of policy it's very i would say

548
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:07,820
ambiguous because what I think it does

549
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,409
it encourages anybody abroad to kick out

550
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,560
as many people as you would like to from

551
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:14,300
your own country because it says well we

552
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,060
will receive as many as you can kick out

553
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:20,510
so that's first maybe some comment from

554
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:23,750
the panelist and second was when we are

555
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:26,270
dealing with the refugee crisis in

556
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:30,490
Europe I think that we are dealing with

557
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:33,770
it both domestically and externally and

558
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,830
domestically the debate is mostly I

559
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:39,710
would say not mostly but to a great

560
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:42,620
extent limited to snipping from one

561
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:47,510
prime minister to the other but what I'm

562
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:51,139
missing is that helping Germany while we

563
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:56,240
are watching Chancellor Merkel to take a

564
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:59,330
deep in the nasty water helping to

565
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,520
project an argument that there are 145

566
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:05,500
signatories to the UN Geneva Conventions

567
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,420
this is not solely a European problem

568
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,730
are we so weak in the European Union

569
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,290
that we can't talk that the countries of

570
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,360
the Gulf and we can only say

571
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,920
statistically that's well they haven't

572
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,800
taken in

573
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:23,270
buddy but we have to take in everybody

574
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,580
isn't it a time that we showed also not

575
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,740
only a big heart that we have for

576
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,350
everybody but also some brains and the

577
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:34,070
teeth because UN convention is not just

578
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:37,219
a piece of paper to which you sign and

579
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,139
then do nothing Thanks gotcha two

580
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,430
questions I think they mainly go to Liz

581
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:47,450
although you didn't say to whom

582
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:49,910
gentleman in the front row deputy tank

583
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,280
based here in Breslau two questions one

584
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:54,680
is about twinning mechanism of bilateral

585
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:58,129
arrangements which for instance this

586
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:01,970
country its country on one hand try to

587
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:04,460
turn down or sink down the quotas the

588
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,810
ear a location mechanism with some

589
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:08,800
numbers on the other hand offered

590
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:12,110
bilaterally to Austria to host

591
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:15,379
temporarily 500 asylum seekers from

592
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:18,560
Austria and I wonder what would be

593
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:21,800
comments from the Commission and from

594
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,450
expert pleased about this arrangement I

595
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,350
not Australian buses in the room and

596
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:30,470
he's listening a second Western Balkans

597
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:32,990
over the winter may become a waiting

598
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:36,530
room a huge giant waiting room for many

599
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:39,050
refugees it's partly by design because

600
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:43,750
what Germany needs to slow down the the

601
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:46,490
whole flow they cannot handle 10,000 new

602
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:51,380
migrants a day maybe they can handle

603
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:55,100
3000 so what the what is the capacity

604
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:57,980
there to House people to we know that in

605
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,770
Germany now people are intense what

606
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,990
about the Western Balkans and what can

607
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:05,990
countries like Slovakia that has a long

608
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,490
relationship friendship and support of

609
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,250
course the Balkan countries do in this

610
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:12,500
and attached to this for your figure we

611
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,870
will have a presidency of the you after

612
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,570
the touch and this migration crisis

613
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,729
might decide the success of failure one

614
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,770
presidency how we handle it I don't

615
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,600
think I don't see our Ministry of

616
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:27,070
Interior and other people involved

617
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,559
in preparation of the presidency

618
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:31,960
focusing entirely on this but are

619
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:35,260
already doing it so as a politician

620
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,580
former commissioner you negotiator what

621
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,700
would you do if you will be in charge

622
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,168
not but what would I get okay great

623
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:47,890
thank you very much is there a third

624
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:49,660
question in this round yes sir um can I

625
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:55,200
can I just say that women are allowed to

626
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:57,220
ask questions too as well as answering

627
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,080
thank you very much you forever all

628
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:05,880
there is autumn a winter is coming yeah

629
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:08,230
there is some project for really

630
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,740
decreasing all these problems of

631
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:14,740
migrants walking through several

632
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:20,230
countries project of the creation of

633
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:25,030
some let's say train bridge or plane

634
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:28,110
bridge this kind of support it was

635
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:31,690
discussed because really an airlift a

636
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:36,039
Berlin Airlift as it were okay thank you

637
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:37,330
sir that's plenty to ask to let me start

638
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,750
and try and allocate some of those

639
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:42,939
questions German constitution and

640
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,750
European teeth without with the Arab

641
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:51,780
world Liz would you like to take those

642
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:54,700
open-ended asylum I repeat slices and

643
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:56,289
dead I mean the thing about the Geneva

644
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,059
Convention international or is there are

645
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:00,400
some unfinished questions about it you

646
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:03,250
have the right to claim asylum but a

647
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:05,850
country also is the one that was those

648
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,260
protection so it's not necessarily

649
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:10,030
unlimited if countries find other means

650
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,919
to offer that protection and some of the

651
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:15,039
issues the concepts that are now being

652
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,270
discussed in many countries is can we

653
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,940
designate Turkey a safe third country

654
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,010
and in international law under certain

655
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,049
circumstances you can say you have

656
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,820
passed through a safe country where you

657
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,950
could and have received protection on

658
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,770
your way to us therefore we can send you

659
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:34,750
back to that so there are you know there

660
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,360
is an unlimited right to claim asylum

661
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,070
and the same would apply to Iran as a

662
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,590
safe country for Afghan

663
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:44,620
in theory you have to meet some very

664
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,209
very strict legal criteria and the UNHCR

665
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,739
is currently revising its guidelines on

666
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:50,769
this and it'll be interesting to see how

667
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,870
you might who and how countries might

668
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:55,600
fall under this rear it but it you know

669
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,299
there are the practical organization of

670
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,189
the right to claim asylum is something

671
00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:02,168
that's deeply complex and could allow

672
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,269
for quite a lot of movement I mean the

673
00:33:02,169 --> 00:33:06,490
entire Dublin system is premised on the

674
00:33:04,269 --> 00:33:08,110
safe third country concept except if

675
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:10,679
you're returning people to Greece

676
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:13,120
obviously and when it comes to

677
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,100
internationalizing this issue you know

678
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,719
it's much easier to internationalize the

679
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,039
funding side of this issue and do

680
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,480
pledging conferences and there'll be

681
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:22,360
another pledging conference in the new

682
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,970
year it's notable that there will be a

683
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,090
world humanitarian summit held in

684
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,730
Istanbul in may of next year so there is

685
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:33,699
this moment now to really talk ok are we

686
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,139
going to bring the international

687
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,590
community together to discuss these

688
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:42,279
things together there are precedents

689
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:44,080
though there was a comprehensive plan of

690
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,929
action that was agreed in the 1980s to

691
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,418
deal with displacement from Vietnam now

692
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:50,919
while the political and contextual

693
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:52,240
situation in Vietnam was very very

694
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:53,500
different there are some lessons to be

695
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,700
learned about what it takes for an

696
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,789
international community to come together

697
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,289
and decide how to equitably just divided

698
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:00,519
up responsibility there is that

699
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,990
President and there's growing pressure

700
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,210
to talk about either a global

701
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:05,740
resettlement program or some form of

702
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,829
international congress that would have

703
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:12,099
be able to have this conversation and it

704
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:13,750
is notable that you know the US and

705
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,790
Canada have been increasingly asking

706
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,199
Europeans what can we do to help but

707
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:19,480
also countries that have never really

708
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,618
been involved in this before Brazil and

709
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,649
Argentina have been offering

710
00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:26,109
humanitarian visas to Syrians and taking

711
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:27,819
several thousand each so far Mexico is

712
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,290
getting ready to launch a resettlement

713
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:31,210
program it's never done that before

714
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,310
there are new actors coming into the

715
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:36,040
field and when it comes to the Gulf

716
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:37,750
states I recognize the challenge of sort

717
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,639
of how do you ask Gulf states to take

718
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:42,579
refugees it's not it's not in this sort

719
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:43,929
of is philosophy what is interesting to

720
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:46,389
note the number of Syrian nationals

721
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:48,280
who've been given labor visas in the

722
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:50,800
Gulf region and that's something that

723
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,369
also happens in Europe if it's easier to

724
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,710
access

725
00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:54,999
the labor market then claim asylum many

726
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:57,249
people will come and try and access

727
00:34:54,998 --> 00:34:59,470
labor market in Poland for example

728
00:34:57,249 --> 00:35:01,450
Ukrainians are using the labor migration

729
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,009
or rather than an asylum route because

730
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,049
it's a lot easier and it's been made a

731
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:06,490
lot easier so we should also look at

732
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:07,930
different ways in which people can

733
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,669
access protection which isn't

734
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,279
necessarily within the sort of legally

735
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:13,839
defined criteria but you think of it 11

736
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:16,210
sort of possible model that you're

737
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,509
pointing to there or sketching is that

738
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:23,200
we could put pressure on Saudi Arabia or

739
00:35:19,509 --> 00:35:26,069
Qatar or wherever to pay for Syrian

740
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,379
refugees to go to Brazil or Argentina

741
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:31,269
rather than Munich interesting so there

742
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,099
are concepts of private sponsorship that

743
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:34,749
are emerging it's a long standing in

744
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,400
Canada which is the idea of offsetting

745
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:38,019
the costs of resettlement by getting

746
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,730
community at is involved it's a bit like

747
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:42,519
the American but if you're suggesting an

748
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,829
international trading of resettlement

749
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:47,618
places the American definition of a

750
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:49,539
Zionist is a Jew who pays for a second

751
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:53,410
jus so does the third you should go and

752
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:55,420
live in Israel I mean it may be worth

753
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:57,819
having a global conversation about what

754
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,499
an equitable division of responsibility

755
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:01,420
is when some of that responsibility is

756
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:03,910
financial and some of that is human and

757
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,480
there and what it would actually take

758
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:10,259
and I'm personally not convinced by the

759
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:11,920
idea of trading quotas for humans I

760
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:14,950
think that could go in a negative

761
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,989
direction Ferno some more innovative

762
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,489
creative responses to get a bigger

763
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:21,400
international response is definitely

764
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:22,779
necessary okay um the west bowl I'm

765
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,230
gonna ask you about the West Vulcan

766
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:27,519
waiting room but going if you want

767
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:30,099
waiting room in a second but just very

768
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,479
quickly on what Liz was saying let's not

769
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:34,509
forget we don't need to talk about

770
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:38,710
Bahrain and Syria is a Saudi Arabia

771
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:40,930
sorry and quite i think that the really

772
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,789
urgent international and much more

773
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:45,339
stepped up international response that's

774
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:47,829
needed is to help the two countries that

775
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:49,450
are completely overwhelmed and stranded

776
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:51,849
and not enough attention is being paid

777
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:54,069
to Jordan and Lebanon they are

778
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,539
middle-income countries that are

779
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:57,279
borrowing from the international

780
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:59,799
financial institutions at higher rates

781
00:36:57,279 --> 00:37:03,670
then then otherwise and it's they have a

782
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:04,990
completely non selvam post-crisis the

783
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,000
systems are overwhelmed

784
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,009
nobody's paying attention so let's not

785
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,200
forget that there is a reservoir of two

786
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:14,380
and a half million people just in Syria

787
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,439
just in Lebanon and Jordan so before we

788
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:20,260
would we would venture into how to force

789
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,330
or cajole Saudi Arabia into taking

790
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,890
someone let's take off let's take care

791
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,930
of the host communities and I very much

792
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,819
agree that the investment needs to go

793
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:30,100
not only to the refugees but the host

794
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,020
communities as well and this is

795
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,390
something this is another crisis that is

796
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:37,270
very easy to foresee they are going to

797
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:39,190
get up and move within the next I don't

798
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:41,560
know whether month or weeks or years but

799
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:43,930
it's going to come unless we take the

800
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,270
resolution yes is a disaster waiting to

801
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,368
happen and not enough attention is being

802
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:51,100
paid we've got roughly 10 more minutes

803
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:53,470
no the Western emotional wait wait the

804
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:57,069
Western Balkans waiting room is exactly

805
00:37:53,470 --> 00:38:00,100
what my humble part of the Commission is

806
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:03,520
trying to prevent an argue argue against

807
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:07,360
we are very concerned about attempts

808
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,880
that are actually vocalized bye bye bye

809
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,660
some member states of sort of desiring

810
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:15,510
to keep the the the refugees in the

811
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,220
Western Balkan countries I think that

812
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:22,080
particularly for me go Slav Republic of

813
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:25,540
Macedonia is in no no shape to to have

814
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:29,950
to be hosting huge numbers currently

815
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:32,800
Serbia is little better off the Prime

816
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:35,549
Minister himself spoke about you know

817
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,050
being able to accommodate a dozen

818
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:40,869
potentially up to 20,000 people but

819
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:43,930
these are really short term short-term

820
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:46,810
measures so I agreed there is a huge

821
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:49,210
danger that unless we do it carefully

822
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:52,650
there could be another bigger problem

823
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:55,840
arising in the in the Western Balkans so

824
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,090
that is something that is certainly not

825
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,460
in the interest of the EU and I think

826
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,990
that you mentioned very well you know

827
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,330
Slovakia and other countries in the

828
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,830
region are very interested in in the

829
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,840
Western Balkans and this could be

830
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,660
potentially a very concrete way of

831
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,300
helping them both in sending people

832
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,040
there as well as may be exploring the

833
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,270
model that we have in Austria I spoke

834
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,950
with the Austrian Ministry of

835
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:23,990
interior last Friday about the model and

836
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:28,220
it is a very interesting one big winning

837
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:29,779
model winning is a way of yes it's a way

838
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,980
of calling it it's a very interesting

839
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:36,980
model and also the lesson from it so

840
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:40,760
slovakia accommodated 500 asylum seekers

841
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:44,300
for austria temporarily in in a town

842
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,580
called gap Chico here and the residents

843
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,280
and the mayor were so worried about it

844
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,160
they actually organized the referendum

845
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:55,760
against it overwhelmingly against having

846
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,009
the the isilo secret stay there few

847
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,040
months down the line the mayor himself

848
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:04,640
said we were needlessly worried it

849
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,770
worked and so I think that that's a very

850
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,220
much a lesson when you look at the

851
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:12,350
eurobarometer the countries that have

852
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,439
very few migrants are the ones that tend

853
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:17,299
to be most anti-migrant and the ones

854
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,610
where you have experience with them are

855
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,190
most like we may get a chance if we're

856
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:24,140
very quick to ask Mary about her country

857
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,360
which is a country that has very few

858
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:33,080
migrants and is having a nervous

859
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:36,860
breakdown over them but first Yong the

860
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,140
Slovak presidency coming up what should

861
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,610
you be preparing for what would you be

862
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:43,580
preferring for if you were in government

863
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:47,240
if I may I would at minus three points

864
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:52,040
yeah first when I represented political

865
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:55,370
majority we passed in years 2003-2004 by

866
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:59,990
a migration office of Slovakia up to

867
00:40:55,370 --> 00:41:04,819
10,000 refugees mostly from Pakistan and

868
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:09,740
Afghanistan no referenda no problem no

869
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:13,670
scare normally makes your way today

870
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:18,109
something I think Pete your electoral we

871
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:19,760
shall have elections my friends so as an

872
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:22,640
opposition politician is going to be

873
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,339
contesting those elections we do you

874
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,680
argue against

875
00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:29,808
the prime minister or do basically

876
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,999
ignore the issue say it's a non-issue

877
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:34,039
we've done this in the past let's move

878
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:37,609
on to the real issues which in my mind

879
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:40,160
are x and y I'm sorry that this this

880
00:41:37,609 --> 00:41:42,229
greynium doesn't speak too much or very

881
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,729
little about the roots on the problem

882
00:41:42,229 --> 00:41:49,578
rather about the realities situation and

883
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:52,098
the complexities and if we don't heal

884
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:54,769
the wounds the roots we don't have

885
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:57,319
answers real answers credible answers

886
00:41:54,769 --> 00:42:00,229
long-term answers to the situation on

887
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:04,999
the continent so I would respond to

888
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:07,939
Milan sure it's our own on German

889
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:11,569
response I'm happy the Germany now and

890
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:14,529
since I'd an hour is full of fast songs

891
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:17,869
Patriota smus something based on

892
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:21,019
Constitution and patriotism and European

893
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:23,150
and foreign policy which is linked to

894
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:25,700
European policy core of german foreign

895
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,039
policy european polish and that's it's

896
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,930
good for us that's good for Germany and

897
00:42:28,039 --> 00:42:32,660
I think what what is needed to add to

898
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,879
this legalistic a constitutional

899
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:39,259
approach that everybody has right I

900
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,420
think they have right to have a country

901
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:44,989
which belong to people i mean they

902
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:48,349
refugees from Syria so let us let us

903
00:42:44,989 --> 00:42:52,999
help Syrian people to get their country

904
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:56,359
back from jihadists from cali fault from

905
00:42:52,999 --> 00:43:00,468
Isis Isis is the biggest international

906
00:42:56,359 --> 00:43:03,920
and global global threat so let us deal

907
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:06,140
with that otherwise we are lost in in

908
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,200
this nitty-gritty debates so there is a

909
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,489
thread ultimate threat and either we do

910
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,078
something and eliminate such threat or

911
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:18,849
we shall have much more difficult

912
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:22,880
situations in Europe of next year

913
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:25,670
Slovakia's presidency Minister of

914
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,309
Interior has a lot to do and elections

915
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:31,700
is coming I think this debate should be

916
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:33,529
with people from interior ministry from

917
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,879
migration office and not only in

918
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:37,099
Slovakia but broadly more

919
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,599
internationally but it's up to them and

920
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:41,720
up to organizers to in

921
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,489
right what I would do differently I

922
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,029
think of course it's important to

923
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:51,829
prepare by action by doing not by sort

924
00:43:47,029 --> 00:43:54,890
of planning but meh refugee crisis is

925
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:58,160
something a long term at least we may

926
00:43:54,890 --> 00:44:02,749
expect and what we shall probably need

927
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:05,118
is kind of revitalization or boost of

928
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:06,799
Schengen and security policy more

929
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,710
coherent approach which means for in

930
00:44:06,799 --> 00:44:13,579
security policy more together with other

931
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:15,920
policies humanitarian development maybe

932
00:44:13,579 --> 00:44:17,839
Schengen group like we have your group

933
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,009
of ministers with permanent president

934
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:24,140
and some some mechanisms to deal with

935
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:27,019
highly sensitive issue and more

936
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:30,470
sensitive than ever and it will not be

937
00:44:27,019 --> 00:44:32,390
diminished in next year's but even more

938
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:37,009
sensitive as I say and we didn't speak

939
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:41,598
too much about terrorism and and of

940
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:44,660
course we should also prepare prepare

941
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:49,069
for a credible Slovakia slow Slovak

942
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:54,170
input into into this preparation of

943
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:58,160
presidency so um i would i would go for

944
00:44:54,170 --> 00:45:00,349
more active and responsive action if i

945
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,729
was quoted at the twitter i said

946
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:06,910
people-to-people people-to-people

947
00:45:03,729 --> 00:45:09,348
solidarity is something important and

948
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:11,598
then there or something about why don't

949
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:13,789
do we have institutions here everything

950
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,950
and that's quote from either from a

951
00:45:13,789 --> 00:45:20,299
normo name everything comes through

952
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:23,390
people & and remains via institutions if

953
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:26,479
we want to integrate in France or in

954
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:28,460
Germany or in Slovakia somebody to live

955
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:30,799
together it must be via people but

956
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:34,249
institutions ministers ministries

957
00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:37,299
governments should facilitate should

958
00:45:34,249 --> 00:45:40,488
create conditions which are safe

959
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:43,640
realistic for for people to people

960
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:47,229
living together integrating together if

961
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,229
not then we shall have a
