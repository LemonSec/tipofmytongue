1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
continue to support it because I believe

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:08,879
it as an idea it makes a lot of sense

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,980
okay but I don't envy you for hammering

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,650
out the details I mean it must be a

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,929
nightmare yeah we are running slightly

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,760
out of time and actually just before we

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,039
just maybe conclude any questions for

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:28,289
the audience before we go for the final

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:29,849
conclusions please i miss my name is

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,859
have no minimum from the eggman

11
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,260
institute i have a question we're

12
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,510
getting the recreation of a capital

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,769
market union because you mentioned that

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:44,550
we need unanimity attic conceal my

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,129
question is for the council concludes

16
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,809
about my my point when it comes to

17
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,489
regulation you usually have the

18
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,050
qualified majority which is less and

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,029
less ambitious instead of everybody and

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,010
they will they will agree on this and it

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,160
was reported so the question is do you

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:04,349
really think that the UK will accept the

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:08,548
draft and yes do you think that I'm

24
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:12,509
optimistic because my education was with

25
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:16,439
the negotiation no time for negotiation

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,630
and maybe we can imagine capital market

27
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,149
union at your zone level if it's not

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,360
possible at 28 and what do you think

29
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,220
about that thank you yeah well um I

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,329
think you have I have to be honest I'm

31
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,340
positive because I have let's say a

32
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:34,500
certain advantage of having listened to

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,720
the British representation in the core

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,009
appear and have a greet of the text so

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,810
it's hard for the minister I mean he

36
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,790
still has the Liberty to do this so a

37
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,220
next Tuesday to dispute a couple of

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,220
paragraphs or wordings where I if I will

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,470
be a brief ever bred i would i would pay

40
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,119
changed slightly some wordy but not the

41
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:57,570
substance um on a capital market union

42
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,310
for the 19th so monitored for the

43
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,439
monetary you know i think there is a

44
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,240
little there is no risk basis other the

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,699
opposite side i mean the the brits if

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,038
they if they subscribe to it on tuesday

47
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,890
its beta concept capital market union

48
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,869
428 they are more concerned about all

49
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,230
these activities that happen in the 19's

50
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,540
within

51
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,738
19th i could or would have an impact on

52
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,298
the outs in particular on london so this

53
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,980
there is the concern and we are waiting

54
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:25,170
for the letter of cameron next week and

55
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,970
see what he wants and what is requesting

56
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,579
and see how we are going to respond to

57
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,109
this but on that part because I mean

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,540
this is why I mentioned the 50 years

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,489
period I mean we have this nice little

60
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,170
label capital market Union but in fact

61
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,640
what is it it's it's it's basically the

62
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,369
internal market for financial services

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,828
that's it basically and I have never

64
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,870
heard a British representative disputing

65
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,239
this you want to be carved out whatever

66
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,819
is I think there is a little risk as

67
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,310
long as we do this properly step by step

68
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,129
and gradually but you will be right to

69
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,269
basically speculate about what a the

70
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:59,730
whole discussion on breaks it could

71
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:00,870
could it the impact on CM you I don't

72
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,640
have a glass bowl I don't know what's

73
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,349
going to happen over that's a couple of

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,929
months I would say yes probably there is

75
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:09,060
a certain risk at a certain moment that

76
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,980
it be may delay a process or even have

77
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,989
even the full stop because there's

78
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,090
uncertainty I don't know I have no clue

79
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,530
about this but I was not exclude it by

80
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,900
definition I would not say they're

81
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,340
strong enthusiasm because as I said and

82
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,620
Marco set is right from the beginning

83
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,000
the Devils in the detail because one

84
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,709
thing is to agree on the political

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,540
statement it's the thrust of the

86
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,209
activity we support the Commission

87
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,650
proposal it's the right direction the

88
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,930
other thing is once we have to deal with

89
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,190
each every regulation with the

90
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,389
prospective directive and all these

91
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,970
things and it comes to nitty gritty

92
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,190
details then the discussion among member

93
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,980
states starts and there is the the

94
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,599
problem but I am a professional optimist

95
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,819
that's when working in the counts of

96
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,488
secretarial and I hear these kind of

97
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,280
let's say is like pessimism about it's

98
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,349
too much too many people around the

99
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,530
table somebody should say that's the way

100
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,418
forward it will never happen in Europe I

101
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,120
promise to you it will never have and

102
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:05,269
I'm happy about this because it's my job

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,069
to help these guys to find something so

104
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,949
no but seriously politically I would say

105
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:13,319
if you start something like say well I

106
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,419
need a dominant player I mean these

107
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,940
gentlemen certainly have in mind a bone

108
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,609
of benevolent dictator who knows the

109
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,159
truth who knows where to go to and stops

110
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:26,490
this kind of fiddling around with

111
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:27,260
details you would lose legitimacy these

112
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,090
complex

113
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,330
discussions and may leave they may be

114
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:35,030
boring and repetitive I what they create

115
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,849
legitimacy over time this is completely

116
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,619
misunderstood it's what I can understand

117
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,670
bankers they're sitting down why then do

118
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,740
the hell do they have been so

119
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,830
complicated why is regulation

120
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,180
inconsistent yes it's inconsistent we

121
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,849
have to hammer out a couple of things

122
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,690
within month I've never seen when I told

123
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:56,090
my boss the brr deregulation which was

124
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,830
foreseen to hammer out in six month and

125
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,109
I told him oh this is critical as a car

126
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,120
so shut up we have to do it and he was

127
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,750
right and we managed these things in six

128
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,240
months did we hammer out the perfect brr

129
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,090
deregulation by definition I said right

130
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,520
from the stuff we will never do so if we

131
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,289
would do so I would be underpaid you

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,210
have to pay much more money if I do the

133
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,030
perfect legislation within six month of

134
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:23,359
a complicated thing like this I would a

135
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:27,020
bank regulation recovery directive I'm

136
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,970
so don't you dare you I'll do it there

137
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,729
but there was the bed the bristles buses

138
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,040
acronym disease again note but this I

139
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,410
mean it's a consistent some external I

140
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,120
would stop in a minute so but they have

141
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,160
what I have to lobby for it I have to

142
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,990
lobby for it because I always enter this

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,600
discussion apart it's too complex in too

144
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,540
long it creates the only mechanism we

145
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,940
know among 28 member states that creates

146
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,340
sufficient legitimacy it's the only

147
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,130
process if anybody would have a smart

148
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,869
proposal how to change this up to the

149
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,909
heads of state and government we would

150
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,310
happily welcome this proposal we have

151
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,620
tested many many things but we need all

152
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,350
member states on board and we want all

153
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,090
member states on board we have seen so

154
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,950
many discussions where we had single

155
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,280
member states basically overruled

156
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:15,409
already in the council where the

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,809
Chairman came to us and said well i am

158
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:21,470
not going to overrule an individual

159
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,480
country i want them on board it's

160
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,280
courageous and they we do it and that's

161
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,560
time consuming i can understand the

162
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,849
frustration the outside world but we try

163
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,850
our best thank you Mark I'm sorry

164
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,099
so we ran out of time I would invite all

165
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,440
the families except cars than you had

166
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,030
your monologue to make a closing remarks

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,040
like what will be the recommendations to

168
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,109
the ministers maybe on CMU and was your

169
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:48,440
take on the whole just briefly not like

170
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:54,930
ours does one of them yeah so okay so

171
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:59,240
the future is bright thanks Carsten you

172
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,240
can have a no short shot thank you okay

173
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,229
I've polarized in down 50 but I mean

174
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,510
very briefly I meant what I said at the

175
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:12,510
beginning recommendations implementation

176
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:15,539
I think I think we have a good set of of

177
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,980
proposals here now and now we need we

178
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,840
need to implement it and to go forward

179
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,880
and the same guy at the same time of

180
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,900
course there is recommendations for the

181
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,170
appeal level but there's also

182
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,580
recommendations for the national

183
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,080
legislature not to do things which go in

184
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,870
the opposite direction meanwhile I mean

185
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,030
I think about my home country I mean

186
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,920
yeah I mean they have the good idea that

187
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,260
dividend should be taxed higher than

188
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,760
pass box well this is not exactly the

189
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:44,550
way where how you how you improve

190
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,440
capital markets so so let's stop doing

191
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,940
the wrong things and let's not be

192
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,250
negative I mean let me finish on a

193
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,510
positive tone let me repeat what I said

194
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,970
at the beginning of course this is just

195
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,440
an action plan this is a work program

196
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,940
for the capital markets and you were

197
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,219
right this is the single market for

198
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,010
financial services overall but it's a

199
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,510
very good piece of proposal one of the

200
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,120
best which came from the Commission in

201
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:08,340
the last year's and this is a good start

202
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,150
and now we need to translate it into

203
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,030
action thanks yeah I think as I said the

204
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:17,549
idea is good my wish for the future is

205
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,590
keep it simple and keep the eye on the

206
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,550
ball that it really creates economic

207
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,500
benefit okay oh just one point remember

208
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,420
all the recent meetings that finance

209
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,600
ministers had about Greece all these

210
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,159
endless nights all these weekends that

211
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,050
could have been avoided if we had more

212
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,059
developed capital markets think about

213
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:38,339
the United States the city of Detroit a

214
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,010
big city those goes under you know

215
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,900
defaults on its debt are there any long

216
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,769
nights of meetings no nothing why

217
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,079
because

218
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:48,449
the debt of Detroit is held in the hands

219
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,189
of many different people many funds they

220
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:51,599
are developed capital markets that's

221
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:53,579
very different from the world we have

222
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,529
here where Greek sovereign debt is held

223
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:57,529
by Greek banks so if you

224
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,029
PPP

225
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:09,029
PPP
