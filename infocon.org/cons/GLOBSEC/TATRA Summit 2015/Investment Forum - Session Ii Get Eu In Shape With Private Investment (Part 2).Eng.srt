1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
we have to to do our homework on

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,750
European level but especially also on

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,700
the on the national level and I said

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,860
structural reforms is very much linked

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,829
with the National holmberg it's a

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,439
bottom-up process process in many many

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,850
of these questions rather than a a

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,720
top-down process yeah so a very last

9
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,150
panel just to sort of make any

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,288
concluding remarks I think we should we

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:31,968
should wrap up but so we go in reverse

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,829
order but I mean what when you're

13
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:37,050
concluding what would be the single

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,790
thing that you would like the panel and

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,000
the audience to take away what's the

16
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,460
thing that could most help the IB

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,809
deliver its mandate most effectively

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,370
what are the key things that you think

19
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,468
it's among the opinion it's it's really

20
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,320
a message of corporation and I think

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,730
yabbies readiness to use to financial

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,239
strengths that we have now through

23
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:04,080
obscene to put this really at work for

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,610
for for for our continent I think we all

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,310
agree and that's why we're sitting here

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:14,820
that the endeavoured to actually create

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:16,830
Europe is is is a bottom-up process any

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,750
a B is at the bottom we are looking at

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,539
projects you're looking at projects that

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,299
we are trying to make to come through

31
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,369
and I think readiness and readiness for

32
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,060
cooperation is is actually the key

33
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:31,860
message that we would like to send out

34
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,420
kunwara what's a against a similar

35
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,700
question what is that what we had a

36
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,700
single bullet two or three main things

37
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,040
that you think could make for a better

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,340
investment climate in Europe that you

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,009
would prioritize I think the number one

40
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,649
notion is to to keep up the

41
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,159
understanding that there's a unique

42
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,140
opportunity now that private sector

43
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,420
money is there in abundance at

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,549
historically low cost and Europe would

45
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,409
miss out on this opportunity and this is

46
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,689
not just European money from all over

47
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,759
the world ready to come and invest in

48
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,310
Europe we shouldn't miss out on this

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,900
opportunity to put our house in order in

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,820
terms of infrastructure for long-term

51
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,130
we should use this opportunity and to be

52
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,239
there we need good quality intermediary

53
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,100
functions like the IV's doing and we

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,060
need the regulation or in the right

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:28,010
sense and i agree with too much defense

56
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:31,310
precision remarks we need good quality

57
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,290
targeted deregulation I getting away

58
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,420
from the hurdles and then we need

59
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,160
projects projects and projects and that

60
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,470
requires intelligent fast-moving

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:45,230
government yeah this is very true it's

62
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,540
it's about speed and I think the the

63
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,950
basic question that we should all take

64
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:55,840
home is since we are all Europeans how

65
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:59,299
can we keep how can we safeguard our

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,000
social economic model in a globalized

67
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,770
world that means we have to be more

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,530
competitive because the rest of the

69
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,120
world is not waiting for Europe and that

70
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,600
is why we have to draft that

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,610
comprehensive picture with viable

72
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,970
projects with a good frame for private

73
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:19,580
and wetlands otherwise we will not we

74
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:23,090
will not survive and it's really about

75
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:26,360
speed speed on the private side speed on

76
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:29,810
the public side so investors should also

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,580
let their governments know whether the

78
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,040
government is doing a good show up or

79
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:38,570
not in that respect or maybe sometimes

80
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,100
since I Mac invincible sword everybody's

81
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,140
free to tell me you are too slow you

82
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,109
know and then I will talk to my staff to

83
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,630
see how can we accelerate our processes

84
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,970
decision making approaching the minister

85
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,370
may be faster pushing the minister to

86
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:55,010
have a faster decision made at the

87
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,980
feedback to the to the stuff all these

88
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,630
issues so we are very open minded to do

89
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,810
that at the end of the day I guess

90
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:04,940
there's something in English which is

91
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:11,330
also true for private investments and

92
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:13,790
end with the FC and the the pudding what

93
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,230
is what is it the putting the truth and

94
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,630
put of the pudding is really eating

95
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,940
through California so we have to we have

96
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,270
to go on we have to be as precise as

97
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,289
possible let's just do it

98
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,198
that there's all the rest of the other

99
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:29,490
members of the panel clearly put the

100
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,129
focus on national governments

101
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,539
particularly to deliver us speedy and

102
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:38,220
effective government summing and

103
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,120
regulation euro work for a national

104
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,490
government used to work in the private

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,240
sector allow you your you are in

106
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:48,060
national what's your what's your key

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,740
message or key priority for what would

108
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,120
you your key takeaway or do it keep what

109
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,129
you would like the audience take away in

110
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,289
terms of wood well what needs to be done

111
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:59,190
I think Thomas indicated very clearly

112
00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:03,060
that ministers should work harder and

113
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:09,780
faster so it's a it's a clear message to

114
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:12,060
me but rosewater message but seriously I

115
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,948
think that initially about the about the

116
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,110
ability to have the dialogue and to

117
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,150
listen to each other between Republican

118
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,610
and private space between the public

119
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,870
sector and private sector because

120
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,319
otherwise we will not be able to move

121
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,490
forward and I don't want to i want to

122
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,199
mention that this not only public

123
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,300
private only business and governments is

124
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,520
also the civil society as such because

125
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,460
this is very much the agenda for the

126
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,130
people for the for the people of Europe

127
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,960
and it is now joined in trees to make

128
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,580
sure that Europe is prosperous that we

129
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,529
have a competitive economic model which

130
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,539
can sustain the social system we have

131
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:50,870
created and which is a jewel of Europe

132
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,460
so I think the ability to cooperate

133
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,650
ability to listen to get together on

134
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,650
specific projects translate this delve

135
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,229
into specific projects and and to get

136
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:06,270
rid of a lot of red tape bureaucracy

137
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:08,099
things which just not allow as the

138
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,008
others were saying not allow us to move

139
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:12,659
quickly enough and nothing in from this

140
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,900
point of view because I think for me

141
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:19,500
okay yes yes yes so in a way the UK

142
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,270
referendum and breaks it thread is a

143
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,940
positive thing because it I think it

144
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:26,669
pushes the Europe to look at its

145
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,889
regulations look at the red tape do a

146
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,690
kind of audit of all the regulation that

147
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,390
exists in euro because i think is a big

148
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,760
part of the of the discussion in

149
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,240
UK and I think we do need it we need to

150
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,330
get a lighter clicker that more dynamic

151
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,970
and quicker to to action so that's my

152
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,740
main message and and mr. what I take

153
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,840
from this discussion right good well

154
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:53,300
I'll take back to London a message the

155
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:58,859
brexit referendum is very good thinking

156
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,140
Rex is not discussion is okay well I'd

157
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,600
like to thank the panel I though a

158
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:06,330
Pasadena let's say I I was here last

159
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,130
year for a very similar panel and in a

160
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,650
lot of progress at one level of the

161
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:14,870
European levels we made since then I

162
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,870
think the clear message of this
