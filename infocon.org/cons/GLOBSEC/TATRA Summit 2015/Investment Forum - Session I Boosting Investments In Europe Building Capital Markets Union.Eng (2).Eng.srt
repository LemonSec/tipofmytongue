1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
market for example I have this small

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:11,269
paper good in bed my sides of it

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:14,849
slovakia the trading in currency euro

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:17,759
good news prospectors not required this

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:22,230
is actually all over european union and

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,480
it is it is obviously good news very

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:30,539
good support from the local authorities

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:33,600
friendly and that is also very necessary

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:35,960
prerequisite verbal confirmation enough

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,559
for our admission to the market

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:43,879
possibility of additional tab okay full

12
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,860
access of foreign investor o'problem you

13
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:50,129
with clearing through BOS euro click

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,769
funds investing bad news no possibility

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:58,410
over your bones like program in slovakia

16
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:01,800
if we take romania on good news prepare

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,378
again a prospect no problem with pension

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,619
funds investing bad news written

19
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,780
permission to the market necessary it

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,430
takes time and that depends on the

21
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,250
country from country to country

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,439
bureaucracy below specific parameters of

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,110
the one of issue need to be submitted

24
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,059
from the very outset a readiness of

25
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,360
placement participants to implement

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,460
additional filter training in euro

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,850
issues with access of other domestic

28
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:33,139
bonds rather than romanian government

29
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:38,820
bonds we tried bulgaria for example

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:41,909
there the situation is a little less

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,919
positive not so very good support from

32
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,409
the local authorities there is

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,530
information to the market necessary no

34
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,640
additional tab possible problems with

35
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,200
pension funds investing and also

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,340
unreadiness of placement participants to

37
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,130
implement initial and further trading in

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,299
in europe so obviously our

39
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,728
recommendation is to there is a need for

40
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,130
further unification of local

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,090
requirements for different groups

42
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:19,680
of issues corporate borrowers financial

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:22,590
institutions IFI obviously what probably

44
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,400
we see is a necessity is to make a

45
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,620
single list of available debt

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,480
instruments for raising funds on local

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,240
markets necessary to set up uniform

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,060
requirements for different group of

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:42,630
issues as well as for different types of

50
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:47,820
that instrument be bond program read

51
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:51,090
boards etc also there is probably very

52
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:54,870
strong need for unification of

53
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:58,640
documentary requirements for admission

54
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,800
to training because they all differ

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,570
requirements for authorization

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,360
translation into different languages it

57
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:09,209
all difference so let me stop right here

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,940
is actually administration it's a burden

59
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,920
also outside the US citizen to you and

60
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,630
Marcus wanted to touch something on this

61
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,929
one so please go ahead I mean I there's

62
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,730
two three things I wanted to underline

63
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,770
number one I mean I think we have and it

64
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,090
has been more or less echoed by our

65
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,940
colleagues we have a problem of

66
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,220
perception of capital so in so far I

67
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,470
think Lord Hill Jonathan hey liz is is a

68
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,050
blessing because he understands that I'm

69
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,609
in this market this single market is

70
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,040
European Union will not work without

71
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:44,250
improvement of the perception of capital

72
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,420
so this is a very good thing then and

73
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:50,340
has been said of course we and this link

74
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,989
state we have a problem in in the

75
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,000
politicians I mean in many countries you

76
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,060
talk to members of governments and

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,770
they're proud not holding stock because

78
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,090
sometimes it's easier and they don't

79
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,220
have problems that they don't have to

80
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,260
declare it prov course this is this is a

81
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,120
major problem because this will not

82
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,489
bring us where where where we should go

83
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,850
then we have a problem is risk of course

84
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,650
nobody and and and how to tackle risk of

85
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,420
course we're not saying we should not

86
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,450
manage the risk and nobody says we

87
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,738
should produce a subprime to of course I

88
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,690
mean I think everybody has had the

89
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,349
learnings but we have this problem of

90
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,760
the perception of risk we have it

91
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,020
as far as the capital market is

92
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,020
concerned we have it as far as

93
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,820
innovation is concerned we have it in

94
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,299
all aspects and if we don't overcome

95
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,120
this we will have big problem in Europe

96
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,370
because because we cannot exclude risk I

97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,990
mean of course we have to manage risk we

98
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,210
have to assess risk we have the control

99
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,520
risk but if we want to exclude risks

100
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,010
exam time this is very much the thinking

101
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,440
of many policymakers in Europe I mean

102
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,940
this is the end of progress and and what

103
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,230
we will have to very clearly say as well

104
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,230
I mean this will be the end of wealth as

105
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,480
well and 11 other point I wanted to

106
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:01,420
touch upon is the financial transaction

107
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,370
tax because because has been raised by a

108
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,050
number of colleagues and just to

109
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,810
underline the dip in business could make

110
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:10,030
communities is heavily opposed to the

111
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,650
financial transaction takes it's a very

112
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,270
strange animal and because I mean of

113
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,640
course there is now only 11 countries

114
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:20,229
which for my taste is still way too much

115
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,849
supporting it but there are so many

116
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,040
question marks I mean first it's very

117
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:28,240
clear that it will before everything

118
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,010
raise the cost of Finance I hope that

119
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,490
the Google raise the cost of raising

120
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:36,159
finance is number one number two is

121
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,280
number two is it is totally unclear I

122
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,810
mean we had a situation for a long time

123
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,059
where at least the French were blocking

124
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:45,430
two derivatives now we have a very

125
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,110
strange situation where they in a

126
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:53,320
strange kind of package deal with the

127
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,590
climate change conference in Paris which

128
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,390
is something totally else they gave up

129
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,880
their opposition to this which which

130
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,250
made the topic move forward so at the

131
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,930
time being there is it clear and present

132
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,490
danger that this most forward but i

133
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,840
would i would totally agree with every

134
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,670
but everything which had been said I

135
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,810
mean this is a very dangerous instrument

136
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,970
because this is totally

137
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,070
counterproductive it can be very

138
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,320
distortive because it's totally unclear

139
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,150
if it is introduced how this would

140
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,790
affect those who are not participating

141
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:26,530
and it's it simply the totally wrong

142
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,230
message and will continue to fight

143
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,059
against it would you like widen it to

144
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,850
all the 28 countries or just get rid of

145
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,950
it completely Oh careful I mean I mean

146
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,969
the reasons the reason why it's not the

147
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,759
reason why it's not

148
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:43,299
proposal on behalf of the 28 instead I

149
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,949
mean all the others to not agree and

150
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:47,198
there's a clever countries around yeah i

151
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:48,639
can mention the right yeah but I mean it

152
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,829
oh it would only have I mean this is a

153
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,069
political thing this is a thing where

154
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:57,819
we're some kind of political punishment

155
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:01,049
to to to what is politically suspected

156
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:03,429
be happy happy financial crisis

157
00:07:01,049 --> 00:07:04,808
apparently needs needed to be invented

158
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:06,248
but I mean if you look at it in

159
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:09,039
substance I mean this is very harmful

160
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:11,319
very dangerous and those goes absolutely

161
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,539
wrong glitch you mentioned risks I can

162
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,459
assure you skin in the game is the basic

163
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,558
principle for SDS securitization and

164
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:19,779
there will be a lively discussion also

165
00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:22,689
on assets treatment and this kind of

166
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,399
digs and also on standardization so

167
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:28,119
because yeah it's a another subprime

168
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:31,329
eventually for many things please yes I

169
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:34,659
think I think it is right and it is

170
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:36,579
prudent to say if you are originating

171
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,679
business and if you're originating risk

172
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:41,769
and then you pass it on to somebody else

173
00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:43,839
who does not have the primary access to

174
00:07:41,769 --> 00:07:46,779
the custom and the business that you

175
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:49,899
keep skin in it yeah that you say you do

176
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:52,269
not sell off all of it but you have a

177
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:54,579
vital interest on the development of

178
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:58,149
this portfolio I think this is perfectly

179
00:07:54,579 --> 00:08:01,360
right there is nothing bad in that the

180
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:03,519
brave hypothesis of this capital market

181
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,489
union is still the same as in many many

182
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:10,239
other aspects of the European idea you

183
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:12,429
just under commerce you just so to say

184
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,969
lift the barriers and then everything

185
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:19,119
which is in this proportionate disparity

186
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:21,549
will flow and will be all the same all

187
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:24,159
over Europe we have seen this in other

188
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:27,128
aspects of economic development that it

189
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:29,438
did not happen we did not see in

190
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,209
productivity we did not see it in wealth

191
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,180
development with we didn't see in

192
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:36,729
another aspect of you in this sense the

193
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:40,149
capital market union could be a bit

194
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:44,709
easier because money can move relatively

195
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:47,490
fast so as it was set rightfully by bama

196
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:49,709
hill if you have a saving mentality

197
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,350
versus an investment

198
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:55,740
tality the one will always keep sitting

199
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,510
on his on his savings book and the other

200
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,690
one will look for new investment

201
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:04,140
opportunities now especially an SME is

202
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,780
in a stagnating economic environment the

203
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,750
question is who is willing to give more

204
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,300
resources to allow growth now from a

205
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:16,770
bank perspective we have learned our

206
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:19,859
lessons still I'm fundamentally

207
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:23,010
convinced if you borrow money you have

208
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,810
duty to repay it yeah still there is

209
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,790
something like non-performing loans out

210
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,250
in the world and if you do your

211
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,410
financial modelling you have to assume

212
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,960
how much of your loans that you're

213
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,900
granting maybe will not come back and

214
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,050
this will give you the risk premium that

215
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,689
you should prudently charge that's the

216
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:46,079
one element the second element is how

217
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:49,140
much debt is good for a company relative

218
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,110
to its own risk bearing capacity being

219
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,780
defined by equity or any sub ordinated

220
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,680
instruments and here i will see a big

221
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:01,439
potential because many entrepreneurs are

222
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,900
stuck in a way they have invested the

223
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,200
money they have they make a moderate

224
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,630
profit but it is not enough really to

225
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,230
take the company further to the next

226
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:16,860
step and if your equity is good for a

227
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,370
loan of 100 it cannot be the solution to

228
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,830
try to grow by taking up alone for 200

229
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,210
simply because the correlation between

230
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:29,670
own funds and equity relative to solid

231
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:32,810
level of debt doesn't work and here I

232
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,880
believe that new instruments new

233
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,030
opportunities to give access also to

234
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:42,000
Central and Eastern European countries

235
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:45,329
to offer investment opportunities within

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,890
the EU to two areas and places where

237
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,870
there is more of an investment and

238
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,270
risk-taking appetite than on the savings

239
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:54,990
appetite is definitely worthwhile the

240
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:57,600
effort so I think still armed with all

241
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,580
the problems and hindrances I fully

242
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,089
agree with what you said it is a very

243
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:05,110
good and ambitious idea and intense

244
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:07,399
and it would be great to see it happen

245
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:18,800
before we move all anybody wants to ask

246
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:20,449
a question please the council will have

247
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,269
some decisions very soon banks

248
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:24,829
structural reform meaning that banks are

249
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:27,470
required to separate their investment

250
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:30,319
banking from their retail or commercial

251
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:31,670
banking proposals since this is such an

252
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:34,128
excellent battle I wondered whether

253
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,809
anybody has a view on that because you

254
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:38,149
could argue to some degree the same

255
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:40,399
things as what has been said about the

256
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,899
financial transaction tax so what does

257
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,569
this panel think about banks started

258
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,339
reform should trading activities be

259
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:48,559
entirely separated or say first of all

260
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,449
be forbidden and then if they are

261
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,469
executed a they're happened outside the

262
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:57,589
bank I mean if I may start from my

263
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,449
simple non-regulatory point of view and

264
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:06,740
then pass on to the really knowledgeable

265
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:10,969
colleague I take it as a valid political

266
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:14,839
desire to say if you have a banking

267
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:18,559
industry and you have people who take

268
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:21,610
their savings and give this to banks you

269
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,620
want to be sure that these savings are

270
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,050
protected and safe and nothing can

271
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:30,079
happen with it and you that you can be

272
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,870
sure that the bank at every time is in

273
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,050
the shape supervision and position that

274
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:39,519
that the deposits are safe now if we

275
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,519
look at the financial crisis of

276
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:48,529
2007-2010 twirl were moderately

277
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,689
capitalized so the risk bearing capacity

278
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:52,449
was relatively low and one of the

279
00:12:50,689 --> 00:12:55,129
answers was to increase the

280
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:58,490
capitalization levels of all banks to

281
00:12:55,129 --> 00:13:01,429
make them more robust second to that the

282
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,439
question was how transparent and how

283
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:06,319
predictable is a bank's balance sheet

284
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:08,870
and here I think it is a reality that

285
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:11,540
you say you have a part of the bank's

286
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:15,110
risk profile which is very predictable

287
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,300
because if you have a

288
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,850
portfolio of mortgage loans with an

289
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,949
average duration of 20 years there is

290
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,410
not much happening within the quarter or

291
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,660
a year and you can also see relatively

292
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,300
clear the activities in private lending

293
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:32,060
and in corporate lending but the element

294
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,550
which is very hard to follow also from a

295
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,170
supervisor's perspective is the whole

296
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,510
element of trading and investment

297
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:40,790
banking well within the limits that you

298
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:44,480
give yourself your risk profile can

299
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,839
change very much very fast so from this

300
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,630
perspective I have some understanding

301
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:55,550
that from a regulatory and protecting

302
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:58,850
intention you want to limit the

303
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:03,920
potential maximum risk a bank can have

304
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:07,130
in this component now and I think there

305
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,810
should be a must be an element for each

306
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,300
and every bank to have trading

307
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:14,089
opportunities because otherwise you

308
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,459
cannot fix your mismatch you must have

309
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:19,850
the possibility to trade currencies to

310
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:23,899
deal with your interest rate hedging and

311
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:27,709
so on so forth if you then say that can

312
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:30,050
go up to a specific level and this is

313
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:33,018
fine as a universal bank I think this is

314
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:36,170
a prudent way if you go so far that you

315
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:38,480
really say a bank that has on the one

316
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,849
hand the universal bank customer facing

317
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,980
with corporate and retail and on the

318
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,640
other hand a relatively big investment

319
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:49,010
arm that you really cut through and and

320
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:54,079
say this must be two banks I find a

321
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:56,360
relatively radical approach and and i

322
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,760
would rather expect that it goes through

323
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,890
the level of thresholds from the total

324
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,790
risk profile of a bank but that is my

325
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,899
view and happy to say that this

326
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,329
discussion for iphone is very

327
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:10,130
theoretical because each and every

328
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:13,519
thresholds which are under discussion

329
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:15,500
are way above our trading and investment

330
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,339
banking activities because we're really

331
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,310
in the down on earth real financial

332
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:24,770
needs and businesses of our customers so

333
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,420
it's it's no issue for us but the

334
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:28,810
academic discussion I find very

335
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,810
interesting

336
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,610
for this life not a banker but if i may

337
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,310
just quicker study i think it is

338
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:40,459
nonsense i mean mr. Lenk is very

339
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,899
Leverett very very polite and as we

340
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,149
talked about i think it is simple

341
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,640
nonsense because what what are we doing

342
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:49,959
today we're kind of regulating and

343
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,189
taxing down the banks to their almost

344
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,560
insolvency because we're taking all the

345
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,829
money that they might earn away we have

346
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,329
regulations to put in place more and

347
00:15:57,829 --> 00:16:02,420
more and more that they cannot earn more

348
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:04,459
so what I what are we doing here if we

349
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,250
do the same thing now in splitting them

350
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,949
up into two different things it will be

351
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:16,160
even worse and then I mean you even use

352
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:18,410
the word forbidding trading okay right

353
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,149
right it's right but I mean this is a

354
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,750
crazy world we're living in sorry I mean

355
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:25,670
there's all the restrictions anymore I

356
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:28,040
mean this is going to bring the real

357
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,779
economy to an end as well and we should

358
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:34,010
we should always bear that in mind but

359
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:36,529
it's currently the politicians are

360
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:39,170
sitting there and say we are the saviors

361
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:41,630
of the world there has been this

362
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:44,990
incredible shift over the crisis from

363
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:47,000
the economy maybe sometimes dominating

364
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,589
too much I don't know the politicians I

365
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,529
don't think so but nevertheless and now

366
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:54,050
the politicians are very much kind of

367
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:55,910
driving back like the wagon by

368
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,410
dominating business in a way they say we

369
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,750
have been saving the bank we've been

370
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,079
saving the world because the world has

371
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:05,119
been would have been lost without us

372
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,280
stepping in helping the banks and buy

373
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,050
this perfect marketing what they're

374
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,040
doing here on the political side all

375
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:15,020
over Europe we we we simply are

376
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,329
forgetting and this is actually their

377
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,459
plan their forget we are forgetting that

378
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:22,550
actually the whole crisis comes across

379
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:24,230
because all of those governors all over

380
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,959
Europe have been spending far too way

381
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,780
money over the past decades then they

382
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,520
actually earned we have crisises mainly

383
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,950
now actually on the under debt credit

384
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,139
debt debt crisis were on honor honor

385
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,419
honor accountant levels I mean look at

386
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,059
Greece look at all the other countries

387
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,720
this is the main problem and we are

388
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,360
discussing

389
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:48,919
now having strong restrictions on banks

390
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,928
again please mark of God very briefly to

391
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:53,179
Kyle's question my first I think Peter

392
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:55,760
might be right that part of the ansible

393
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:58,039
on the thresholds but we'll see but two

394
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,809
karats question I mean of course the

395
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:02,000
question we are a business Europe asking

396
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:06,168
ourself is will display the fin aversive

397
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,179
banks help them to serve have the system

398
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:10,220
to serve the real economy better and our

399
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:14,450
answer is no so we don't think it's a

400
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,280
good idea because it will not lead to a

401
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,679
situation where we're real economy will

402
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:21,049
be supported bit and maybe just to suit

403
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,610
to you at this point BS are installed

404
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:25,730
and some people hope maybe it will be

405
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:28,939
drawn so let's see what BS are installed

406
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:38,419
now so Daniel negotiations going on no

407
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:40,789
yes on a council level no no definitely

408
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:44,299
not there is at least one issue I'll we

409
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:47,929
accommodate Vickers vice versa the rest

410
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:50,650
of the group for example and your

411
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:54,380
questions from the from the auditorium

412
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:56,299
ok it's not sure definitely may be

413
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,730
interesting to look at the united states

414
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:01,429
where for many decades we have the

415
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,470
glass-steagall act in place and then in

416
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:05,600
nineteen ninety nine which separated the

417
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,409
two functions that you've alluded to and

418
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:13,820
then in the late 90s 99 i believe that

419
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:15,770
act was effectively repealed so and how

420
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,809
post-financial crisis we went back to

421
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,400
the glass-steagall world so clearly in

422
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:21,649
the US i think people would be more

423
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,870
sympathetic to the idea of separating

424
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,299
the utility function of banking's or the

425
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,678
deposit kind of the the part that has to

426
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:30,740
be bailed out by the government if

427
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,780
necessary from the more speculative part

428
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,690
that is more involved in trading in

429
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,418
financial markets so i don't know i

430
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,860
wouldn't call it complete nonsense I at

431
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:42,200
least from the US perspective it

432
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,969
wouldn't be viewed that way but of

433
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,980
course Europe has its own specifics and

434
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,950
universal banks of a much richer history

435
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,149
here if I may touch on a couple of other

436
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,650
things that have been mentioned here in

437
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:54,860
the panel earlier

438
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,990
so one was that 2019 might actually be

439
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,449
too ambitious in terms of completing the

440
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,670
capital markets Union because we have to

441
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,620
harmonize all the laws insolvency laws

442
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,290
and the tax laws and the accounting laws

443
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,419
and I wonder whether we really need to

444
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,830
harmonize everything everybody talks

445
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,010
about harmonizing all these standards

446
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:15,020
but I think it would go a long way if

447
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:18,560
instead of harmonizing we simply

448
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:22,310
clarified which rules apply in which

449
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,100
situations so imagine a Slovakian buying

450
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:28,490
shares of a German company listed in

451
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,560
London okay they might be reluctant to

452
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,210
do this if they're uncertain about which

453
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,100
countries rule will apply to this

454
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,290
transactions a German laws is it British

455
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,030
laws is it slovakian laws if we could

456
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:41,060
remove this uncertainty this would have

457
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:43,190
to be done top down by simply specifying

458
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:47,240
okay we all agree it's going to be the

459
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:49,210
say the country of issuance or I mean if

460
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,790
that uncertainty is removed then I think

461
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:56,330
harmonization is not all that crucial

462
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:59,060
and from that perspective 2019 might be

463
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,830
perfectly achievable and one other point

464
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,659
that was mentioned here was about the

465
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,520
United States how the average American

466
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,960
talks about stocks after you spent five

467
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,480
minutes with them and that's absolutely

468
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,030
true and and the reason is pretty

469
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,700
obvious because for over three decades

470
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:16,129
Americans have had private pensions in

471
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,860
the early 80s private pensions were

472
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:22,010
introduced and now most people in the

473
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,379
United States myself included have a

474
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:27,320
have a pension and we we make our

475
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,210
decisions any any time at any point you

476
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,340
decide how much to invest in stocks

477
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,650
which stocks which bonds which mutual

478
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,459
funds you have to make your choices and

479
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:40,970
that is the best way to build literacy

480
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,160
in fact building up upon this I think

481
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,960
one one great thing we could do in

482
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,470
Europe after the development of capital

483
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,540
markets would be to develop portable

484
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:54,230
private pensions and this is something

485
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,720
that is mentioned in the in the plan

486
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,370
from the Commission it is the one point

487
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,879
I would highlight perhaps above above

488
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,418
others

489
00:21:59,879 --> 00:22:05,779
because if you have first of all if you

490
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:09,209
have portable private pensions these are

491
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:11,219
vehicles in which people can save for

492
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:13,139
their own retirement wherever they move

493
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:15,419
within Europe they can take them with

494
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:17,069
them this would be helpful not only for

495
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,949
the development of capital markets

496
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:21,719
because this would boost the development

497
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:24,329
of pension funds which are key players

498
00:22:21,719 --> 00:22:27,029
in capital markets this would also have

499
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:29,940
the benefit of enhancing labour mobility

500
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:32,249
in Europe which is absolutely essential

501
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,729
I mean we all know your Europe is not an

502
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:38,399
optimal currency area and having more

503
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:41,579
labour mobility would be desirable to

504
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:43,529
keep the countries in the euro and you

505
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:47,129
know having portable pensions would

506
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,690
would clearly go along your way and then

507
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:51,029
finally it would help with the

508
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,269
demographic problem which is as we all

509
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:56,549
know a very big problem in Europe so

510
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,619
this is this is this is one thing we

511
00:22:56,549 --> 00:23:00,779
could do that would tackle at least

512
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:02,968
three major issues in Europe develop

513
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:06,509
capital markets support labour mobility

514
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:09,719
and and helps all the demographic

515
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:11,940
problem you all touch at some point the

516
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:13,589
the issue that you need to explain have

517
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,229
a plain or simple language or clear

518
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:18,839
language with people involved in the CMU

519
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:21,929
so maybe like to start it Carson how do

520
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:24,869
you educate investors retail investors

521
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:26,399
in our institutional investors about CMU

522
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:27,779
about the possibilities to make it

523
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:29,639
happen because this is one of the

524
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:33,329
crucial items on the on the shopping

525
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:35,069
list to make it to make it work or it

526
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:39,959
could have a very concrete and take this

527
00:23:35,069 --> 00:23:42,899
example of this panel I mean I will not

528
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:46,440
let a follow-up to the bashing stories

529
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:48,299
who did what I've been serving for seven

530
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,999
years to the council and different

531
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:53,729
formation here a group a coffin

532
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:55,229
competitiveness Council and sometimes in

533
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:57,269
the year the european heads of state and

534
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:59,219
government Anna listen to you your

535
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,989
statement basically telling that their

536
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:02,339
self-perception of ministers is like we

537
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:04,769
are the saviors of the world I have to

538
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:07,708
say I've never attended a single meeting

539
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:09,479
where this was either explicitly or

540
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:12,790
implicitly expressed by any of the

541
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:14,620
ministers in no meeting whatsoever

542
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,659
but it's never telling what you are

543
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,090
basically telling us here how you look

544
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:21,940
at politicians what do you think about

545
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,459
politicians I think the story starts

546
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,690
with that it tells me that your

547
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,150
perception is completely different from

548
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:31,300
their reality I remember basically into

549
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:34,150
the four weeks in june july this year we

550
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:37,330
had 19 state secretaries meeting in four

551
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:40,420
weeks 19 state secretary meeting 10

552
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:42,189
ministerial meetings and four heads of

553
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:44,920
state and government meetings do you

554
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,680
honestly think these guys enjoy meeting

555
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,630
each and every day in Brussels or if

556
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,030
every second day and dealing with these

557
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:54,220
financial problems and then go out and

558
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:56,410
tell people oh we are the saviors of the

559
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,420
world I tell you starting with angle

560
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,690
America going down there basically the

561
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:03,550
vvv members list do the financial

562
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:05,380
financial media finance ministers and to

563
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:08,379
the States it is not a single person

564
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,390
enjoys this kind of exercise they do not

565
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,670
see themselves as savers of the world

566
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,630
but if the perception is like this and I

567
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,790
tell you from the beginning of the

568
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,470
crisis it was exactly the opposite side

569
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:21,129
of the minister side the perception was

570
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:23,290
this reckless bankers and from that kind

571
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:26,560
of attitude a couple of activities were

572
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:29,290
started that tells me there is something

573
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,730
wrong in the perception there is

574
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,490
something wrong in the mutual

575
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:37,780
understanding and it tells me people are

576
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:39,520
not talking enough and there they I have

577
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,379
seen many many sector since i'm dealing

578
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,360
with many sectors one of them and this

579
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,600
concerns me most is the financial sector

580
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,189
is extremely self referential they love

581
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,260
to meet with others because they can

582
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,660
communicate easily they understand this

583
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,760
but out to the outside world of

584
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,190
financial sectors they have serious

585
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,350
serious problems to communicate in a

586
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,870
proper way because they simply use the

587
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,419
same language the same methodology I

588
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:07,719
mean we can give an example financial

589
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:10,720
tax I'm a trained economist I share all

590
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,120
the concerns you have repressed when I

591
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,310
talk to people and visitor groups well

592
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,899
educated people they do not understand

593
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,080
the first argument that's how it

594
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:22,740
destroys capital market activities they

595
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,389
dispute this and not only them I

596
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,350
remember very vividly when we had a very

597
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:28,780
very long

598
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,299
debate in the echofon council where one

599
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:33,490
minister the formal swedish minister

600
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:36,220
unders book made the same points that

601
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,900
were put forward here and he was heavily

602
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,429
disputed by at least half of the

603
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,650
ministers in these meetings and well

604
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:43,480
you're basically wrong the perceptions

605
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,950
completely different our analysis is

606
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,400
different we come to different

607
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,169
conclusions so they are not the savers

608
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,510
of the world they have similar problems

609
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:54,820
and sometimes I wonder and this basic

610
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:57,100
you prove it perfectly how isolated you

611
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:02,460
are in your thinking when you talk about

612
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:05,168
the FTT itself the FTT is a price I

613
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:08,020
don't like it i would even share your

614
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:11,520
view don't you ever implement this but

615
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:14,260
the FTT was a price the FTT was a price

616
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:20,860
for some of the Parliament's approval of

617
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:22,600
the ESM you may say in the end okay DSM

618
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,889
is the european stability mechanism that

619
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,820
basically has programmed countries or

620
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,159
those who are not familiar with the

621
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:30,820
acronym so i have the same process

622
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:33,580
disease like many of us um this was the

623
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,559
approval basis the condition of the

624
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,379
approval in Parliament's to agree on the

625
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,879
ESN on the rescue mechanism so those who

626
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,890
are constantly against it should say

627
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,240
well the heads of states in government

628
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:47,710
the minister should have let fall in

629
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:50,080
portugal ireland and greece in order to

630
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,490
avoid the FTT I'm not sure whether you

631
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,990
all subscribe maybe you subscribe to it

632
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,250
and say well they have done too much

633
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,740
anyhow that's what i read from your

634
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,840
statement right now but this is a

635
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,990
political price you had to pay so that

636
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,939
tells me these things are not basically

637
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,890
isolated in each sector so the

638
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,380
instrument and then in the financial

639
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:10,419
sector it has a political component like

640
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,030
any political decision has an impact on

641
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:15,820
the financial sector and in my personal

642
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:19,690
view humble view is we do not have

643
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:22,000
enough bridges to communicate I know a

644
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,309
couple of ministers not the ones in now

645
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,380
in the council but the former ones they

646
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:29,470
are not experts they afraid of all the

647
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,120
terminology that people are using you

648
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,799
could have asked basically ministers

649
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,469
about secret ization what does it mean

650
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,330
and then the first connotation that

651
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:38,740
comes to the mind of ministers is this

652
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,029
was one of the troublemakers of the

653
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,759
financial crisis

654
00:28:40,029 --> 00:28:44,889
and I've seen already responses we may

655
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:48,159
dispute I do not share this view this is

656
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:50,799
the perception so we have to start on

657
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,809
this talking on this in probably less

658
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,899
technical wave five ways it means i'm

659
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:57,549
not a linguist expert on this but we

660
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:59,049
have to talk more we have to explain

661
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:01,840
more we have to explain better and we

662
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:03,639
have to change the language technical

663
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,769
language does not translate into

664
00:29:03,639 --> 00:29:08,320
understanding that's my my simple

665
00:29:05,769 --> 00:29:10,389
conclusion and I see this even on our on

666
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,799
our side and I would not blame the

667
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:13,149
finance sector the political sector has

668
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:15,580
the same problem the same language

669
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:17,498
problem we are not investing enough in

670
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,449
this so it starts with language we

671
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:20,919
should invest much more and investing

672
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,719
language does not mean we translate

673
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:25,419
everything in 23 languages that's not

674
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:27,580
the translation issue there we invest a

675
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:28,719
lot of money by the way in Brussels but

676
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,489
you'll come from the council so how do

677
00:29:28,719 --> 00:29:33,009
you change it actually you create like a

678
00:29:30,489 --> 00:29:34,389
gazillion of papers like now just one of

679
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:35,979
the elements in this way i like the

680
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:37,779
in-form accounts looking forward to have

681
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:41,469
the informer council there in Slovakia

682
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:43,830
is we invite people to present their

683
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:46,419
views probably the a coffin is not

684
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,769
fairly progressed I think the

685
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:50,379
competiveness council does a little bit

686
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:51,789
better to have not let the technical

687
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:53,678
experts but experts from different

688
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:55,479
stakeholder groups to listen and to

689
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,299
exchange their views in these cutting

690
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:59,950
these luncheons this informal part this

691
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:02,609
part of exercise but it there should be

692
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:05,469
lets say much much larger larger scope

693
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:07,658
invite have dialogues have even more

694
00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:09,489
dialogues don't restrict it only two

695
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:11,440
luncheons do this even informal meetings

696
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:13,690
in the informal a cough in Slovakia

697
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,999
could set an example I'm talking already

698
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,919
for instance with the Dutch presidency

699
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:20,710
as well the trio could set a new example

700
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,299
in this kind of dialogue and then the

701
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,330
other thing is basically encourage

702
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:27,489
ministers chair people of groups to go

703
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,168
out to reach out basically and not only

704
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:30,909
to communicate with in Brussels or the

705
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,799
indian national capital to reach our

706
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:35,469
your room dyson boom was here yesterday

707
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,269
i think gave a speech these kind of

708
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:39,639
thing we need much much more of these

709
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,589
activities from brussels out from the

710
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:44,349
institutions then go out reach out

711
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:46,178
communicate Talk listen to people try to

712
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:48,189
understand what they are asking what

713
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,539
they are telling and try to respond in

714
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:51,690
the language that they can understand

715
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,440
and not hide behind the Brussels

716
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:55,330
language war

717
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,299
basically where we have this well

718
00:30:55,330 --> 00:31:00,668
trained phrases which is behind which we

719
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:02,019
can hide and say well we use them again

720
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:04,059
and again and again which nobody would

721
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:06,789
understand let's in thats my humble view

722
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:09,580
just on reaching out talking we need

723
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:11,139
more dialogue it does not suffice listen

724
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,320
to hide behind these let's say

725
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:15,969
individual silos and then say we are

726
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,259
right and the others are wrong to the

727
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:21,840
sectors respond just one sentence and

728
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:24,940
there's a lot of the same servant I

729
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,100
would agree with with with Carson I mean

730
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,320
on the FTT I mean you obviously know why

731
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:33,219
we have to fight against it I mean I'm

732
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:35,470
totally aware of the history we both

733
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,690
know that not all political prices which

734
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,509
have been given at a certain moment have

735
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,889
been paid in all directions so so

736
00:31:40,509 --> 00:31:44,110
therefore i mean the debate will will

737
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:46,539
continue but on what you said about the

738
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,250
phrase a lot of phrasal phraseology and

739
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:50,799
the linguistic i would totally agree but

740
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,889
it does not only limit to the financial

741
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,250
sector i mean just to just do to bring

742
00:31:53,889 --> 00:32:00,580
another sector you know the the the very

743
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:04,450
latest abbreviation in brussels very

744
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:06,519
much at the mode is the TC MV where

745
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:09,340
nobody knew what it was about two weeks

746
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,659
of no more five weeks ago but this is

747
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,209
the technical committee on motor

748
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:15,009
vehicles and now at the time being i

749
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,960
mean this is the abbreviation which is

750
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:20,529
maybe on the under on top of the hit

751
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,460
list and and and me myself in my in my

752
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:27,399
weekly discussions with my directors I'm

753
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,679
maybe seven six seven times asking what

754
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:31,258
the hell is this now so so of course

755
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,509
there's hundreds of these abbreviations

756
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:36,220
not all of them are avoidable but but

757
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:37,960
you're totally right them and we should

758
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,570
to great efforts in this way in this

759
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,539
directive because otherwise we will lose

760
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,460
the people but I still would like to

761
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:47,139
hear the answer because let's go back to

762
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:49,750
the bank to the capital markets Union

763
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:51,340
and investors future one because as you

764
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,129
just mentioned maybe there is a change

765
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:57,250
of culture moving curve from deposits to

766
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:59,049
investing so how do you do it we should

767
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,269
be in charge how do you do it how do you

768
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:03,879
teach and educate future investors how

769
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:05,480
do you talk to people let's say pension

770
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:06,799
in Slovakia or net

771
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,559
forever because you need these people

772
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,240
and to understand and also you said you

773
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:13,280
cannot expect a carpenter to be a

774
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,750
financial engineer so but you need these

775
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:22,899
people to understand this thing so how

776
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:26,559
do you do as a bank the reality is that

777
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:30,320
you have all kind of regulation on

778
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,879
various layers we have were active in 15

779
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,460
countries in Central and Eastern Europe

780
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,000
of course we have to make sure we always

781
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,130
observe the national regulation on top

782
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,650
of that we have to adhere to the

783
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,110
Austrian regulation since in Austria is

784
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,080
our head office and now we are under

785
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:51,110
direct ECB supervision so of course all

786
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,350
European regulation also has to be

787
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:56,600
adhered to this is a fact and all this

788
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:59,418
is fine as long as we first understand

789
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,209
the regulations and second they are not

790
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:04,130
contradicting and I think here is the

791
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:08,090
element where I fully agree with you we

792
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:10,909
need a clarity we need transparency and

793
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:13,940
we need the willingness to address the

794
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:17,090
contradictions because somebody is left

795
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:20,418
over at the end if I have a board member

796
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:23,450
who is personally responsible for

797
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:26,480
adhering to the local rules and I as his

798
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:28,668
supervisory board member tell him if you

799
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,969
do that I have a problem with my

800
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:33,560
European rules one of us we can both sit

801
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,658
there and look at each other and say

802
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,810
that we are said but we would expect

803
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:41,030
that one of the two regulators would be

804
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:44,330
ready to acknowledge and to start the

805
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:46,250
dialogue which rule now to change to

806
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:49,009
give the real economy in the group like

807
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:51,830
ours an environment where we don't have

808
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:54,770
to live in contradicting regulation in

809
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:57,590
this sense I personally perceive it as

810
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:00,140
positive now that for example the

811
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,210
guidance in steering and regulation for

812
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,270
the biggest banks in Europe came under

813
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:08,390
the regulation of the ECB yes it is a

814
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:10,280
hell of a work for us now to do very

815
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,190
fast the step from the Austrian

816
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,830
regulation to the ECB regulation but at

817
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,540
least I have one final boss and if they

818
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,220
say yes or no I know me out

819
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,490
no what I have to do and I know what I

820
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,399
cannot do and this helps very much and I

821
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:29,490
think in that sense it is on the one

822
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,480
hand important to bring this to the

823
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:35,580
surface it also needs on the other hand

824
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,960
effective power structures that bring

825
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:42,270
endless dialogues to an end and here I

826
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,120
think this is something where there is

827
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:48,300
also an area of improvement way too many

828
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:51,779
things end up in there we agreed to

829
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:55,110
disagree and we now have to find again

830
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:58,620
some pieces to trade and to balance

831
00:35:55,110 --> 00:36:03,150
interests and to see how do we come to a

832
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:07,680
common denominator to move on into one

833
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:09,840
way or the other and I think this is in

834
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,109
my view what I will talk from the

835
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:16,410
capital market union that whenever in

836
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:20,060
doubt what should now be the direction

837
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:22,980
to take that this direction is

838
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,810
predominantly driven not by individual

839
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,750
political interests of member states

840
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:30,029
that it is driven by the intention of

841
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:33,510
the regulation what do we want to

842
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:36,510
achieve we want to give one unified

843
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,460
capital markets where people who offer

844
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,950
investments and people who look for

845
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,470
investments can meet each other in a

846
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:46,259
relatively simple format that would be

847
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:48,500
the perfect outcome and and I trust the

848
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:53,100
way you described it and you attitude it

849
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:55,950
that if this spirit is is realized then

850
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,200
finally the intermediaries as the banks

851
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,870
will have an environment in which we

852
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,120
know how we can function and finally the

853
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:06,779
real economy has a benefit because they

854
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:09,890
get easier access to to capital and end

855
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,890
to that so

856
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,440
you
