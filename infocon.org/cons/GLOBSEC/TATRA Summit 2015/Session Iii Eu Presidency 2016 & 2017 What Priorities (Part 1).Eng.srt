1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950
for to look at weather issues such as

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,870
growth promoting policies might be you

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,990
know more important in some ways than

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,160
the strictest possible application of

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:20,939
the rules thank you right in the five

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,180
present report it was clearly intended

7
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,220
as an independent advisory group outside

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,720
the Commission is that a vote of no

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,810
confidence I don't think so i think

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,239
we've established a fiscal council like

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,649
all of the countries have outside the

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,029
Ministry of Finance I haven't

13
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,120
experienced that as a vote of no

14
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,430
confidence we still design the budget we

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,230
still establish ourselves whether we are

16
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,149
inside the rules and the obligations

17
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,980
that we have and yet there is an

18
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:52,949
independent advisory council also in the

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,199
Netherlands which does its own estimate

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,730
and tells me well maybe you're just off

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,190
target maybe you want to do a little

22
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,410
more or maybe you're well inside target

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:06,509
I think to have that kind of independent

24
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,429
assessment helps I'm not I'm very strong

25
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,760
in favor of political decision-making in

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,390
Europe it is crucial for democratic

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:20,100
legitimacy but you have to distinguish

28
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,840
the let's say technical assessment and

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,610
the political decision-making so x fin

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,979
will still do its work we will still

31
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,820
send our drop like we have at national

32
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,979
level an advisory group outside which

33
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,689
sometimes criticizes us sometimes

34
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,579
criticizes the Commission and says well

35
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,720
the way you're interpreting the rules is

36
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,298
very flexible and that will make sure

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,720
that we stay sharp and well tuned to the

38
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,280
pact I think that was also part of the

39
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,320
idea when we wrote the the five

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:56,390
presidents report that this independent

41
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,389
fiscal council would also advise on that

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:05,440
mr. president thank you very much done

43
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:05,440

well you know even if you actually were

45
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,959
a french minister probably I wouldn't be

46
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:19,250
sitting here but mark the chant that

47
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,630

this panel for the next we've got about

70
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,660
50 minutes so we actually had a coffee

71
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,850
break coming up and I'm very happy that

72
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,960
most of you have decided to stick with

73
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:43,550
us I've been thinking about how to pitch

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,200
this panel actually last night I had an

75
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,080
unexpected visit to the emergency room

76
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,500
with my daughter and while waiting for a

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,260
doctor outside the ER Sheena reading a

78
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,830
children's book it's a classic by

79
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,320
Marilyn Sadler called it's not easy

80
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:03,740
being a bunny and it's about the bunny

81
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,349
who basically is not very happy living a

82
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,160
life of a bunny so it tries out a life

83
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:12,229
with seven different animals only to

84
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,389
discover that actually it's not feel a

85
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,310
bit about this panel it's not easy

86
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,010
discussing the trio and it's not easy

87
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,310
discussing the EU presidency but I hope

88
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:25,340
we do come away from this panel surely

89
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:27,650
there is a substance and there is some

90
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,630
excitement to this and so I'm very happy

91
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,270
that I not only have you here in the

92
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,620
audience but we have a very

93
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:37,820
distinguished set of panelists here

94
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,490
started with a bit of discussion on the

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,960
EU presidency and the trio let me start

96
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:48,500
from my nearest right we have Hans file

97
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,799
brave my my my touch is not very Hans is

98
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,840
i should say somebody who wasn't

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,060
supposed to sit on the panel and my

100
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,429
pleasure is even bigger that you're here

101
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,100
unfortunately and i have to excuse

102
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:03,289
ambassador Richard fun reason who was

103
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,600
the original person on the panel

104
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:08,360
unfortunately fell sick and I hope we

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,550
all wish him well soon so very warm

106
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,680

and is the principal advisor to the

109
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,130
minister on euro related matters and I

110
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,560
promise not to be too tough on him since

111
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,740
he's a plasma replacement on bigger

112
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,169
questions so I'll try to restrain I

113
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,009
promise on my father right in the middle

114
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:34,229
we have in

115
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,059
orico comes from alta is the i

116
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:38,789
understand the youngest member of the

117
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:40,529
executive in malta and it's also the

118
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:42,659
parliamentary secretary responsible for

119
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,939
the preparation of the EU council

120
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:48,089
presidency and is also responsible for

121
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,879
EU funds so very warm welcome to you and

122
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:53,309
last but certainly not least on the very

123
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,110
home turf we have amankwah truck who is

124
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:57,059
the state secretary here in slovakia and

125
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,990
is also the governmental plenipotentiary

126
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:02,789
for the council presidency of slovakia

127
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,279
in the latter half of next year

128
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,229
gentlemen welcome to you welcome to all

129
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,210
of you and let's kick it off I hope we

130
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:14,248
can have kind of a snapshot interaction

131
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:16,529
not quick speeches or long speeches but

132
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:18,779
rather a discussion will try to lead it

133
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:20,460
here on the panel for the next 25

134
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:23,610
minutes or so and then we'll open it up

135
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,739
to questions from the audience my

136
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,370
initial question is and I guess this

137
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:31,889
gets back to my thinking about well how

138
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:35,059
to really pitch this why should we care

139
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:38,909
about presidency these days why is

140
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:42,839
presidency in the post Lisbon era still

141
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:45,889
important or is it what would you say to

142
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,959
this and maybe I'll ask here on the spot

143
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:50,339
the Hun's from the Netherlands you've

144
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,680
been in the present not you personally

145
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:56,789
but netherlands in the presidential seat

146
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,370
a number of times is it still important

147
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:02,490
and actually doesn't actually matter in

148
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:05,789
issues related to emu euro what

149
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,580
relevance do foresee it'll play in a few

150
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:11,699
weeks time it doesn't laughs I mean when

151
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,068
we were last president in 2004 we try to

152
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,409
push down the services directive we

153
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:20,009
didn't succeed fully but we made a long

154
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:21,659
way and now for the next six months we

155
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:23,519
will try to push further the banking

156
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:25,740
Union the capital markets union with you

157
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,409
that's been pointed out who's which amp

158
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,419
which is very very important so I mean

159
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,099
well from a national perspective you

160
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,260
could say you cannot push your own

161
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,089
agenda I mean it's not about pushing a

162
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,338
Dutch agenda now it's pushing Europe

163
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,990
forward so I would say yes indeed is

164
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,430
very important and it's also very

165
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,479
important that we do it the three of

166
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:44,130
hasn't let alone

167
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,540
so that this is sort of a rolling a

168
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,100
gentleman and you think that residency

169
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,230
still plays a role to the extent can

170
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,120
push certain things absolutely my

171
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,430
experience is having been in the

172
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,410
Eurogroup residency that we really

173
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,388
pushed for things like the banking Union

174
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,949
I mean the banking Union wouldn't have

175
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:00,870
been there is isn't there would have

176
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:02,519
been a big push by even the ice movement

177
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,459
also by the rolling presidencies then

178
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:08,370
like Lithuania and Latvia etc mm-hmm so

179
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,899
yes okay multan Slovakia newcomers this

180
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,649
is going to be the first time and the

181
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,180
first time is always very important we

182
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:18,779
want to leave a good impression but also

183
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:22,170
get the job done and capitalize on it in

184
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:25,320
the wider context how is the thinking in

185
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,149
Malta is the presidency still important

186
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,880
you kind of lose the limelight you don't

187
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,680
have the Prime Minister taking the

188
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,810
center stage in Brussels nonetheless

189
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,939
there is a lot at hand when we look at

190
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,869
the tasks which the EU has to deal with

191
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:43,320
I think that every every rotating

192
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,930
presidency leaves its mark somehow and

193
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:50,339
some in some way or another so being

194
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:52,109
also post Lisbon we have to take into

195
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:57,690
into the equation the European

196
00:09:52,110 --> 00:10:00,720
Parliament and therefore also dealing

197
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,180
with the other colleges later which is a

198
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,630
crucial thing especially if you if you

199
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,880
are going to preside for the first time

200
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:12,630
and definitely it's also an opportunity

201
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,240
for our our public administration which

202
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:19,110
is doing a lot of work at working group

203
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,740
and working party levels indeed the

204
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:25,290
eighth of and and and also functional

205
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,839
we've been working together with with

206
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:32,610
with Evan we had Peter beforehand and

207
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:37,019
and and and we believe that that it's

208
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:40,319
also important now to step up the

209
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:44,760
communications with local citizens which

210
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:47,849
sometimes sometimes even even

211
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,670
not not just the man on the street

212
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,520
between the institutions and therefore

213
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,010
it's crucial for us not to raise too

214
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,660
much the expectations there's the

215
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,689
Commission's work agenda set by the

216
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:04,410
European Council and our role is is

217
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:07,950
quite functional and and an operative

218
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:12,449
one of course we don't in some instances

219
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:15,930
where we need to react to tu tu tutitu

220
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:21,330
the changes which are ongoing black

221
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:23,160
comes to migration but what but it I'm

222
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,650
pretty sure that will have opportunity

223
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,140
to to enter into more details of us in

224
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:31,620
the next 18 months yes you've opened up

225
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,939
a very good wider issue of the

226
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,520
importance of the presidency and that's

227
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,320
not only the avantco truck even you've

228
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,449
experienced the number of presidencies

229
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,350
as Slovakia's permanent representative

230
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:46,650
in Brussels see losing its importance

231
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:49,260
pose Lisbon and what is the Slovakia's

232
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:52,079
in that sense expectation what should it

233
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:55,410
be in terms of tnm outline how can we

234
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,510
sell this package this position back at

235
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,360
home that is to the slovak public which

236
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:03,450
actually has been one of the public's in

237
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,770
the e when we look at the trends which

238
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,140
on a lot of related issues has at a very

239
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:14,420
optimistic or fairly optimistic outlook

240
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:17,310
so how to work with this further first

241
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,490
back to your original question which I

242
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:24,630
think was extremely important when you

243
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:27,750
asked whether presidency of the council

244
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:30,900
still matters my simple answer is yes it

245
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,540
does it's my own experience because I

246
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,209
had a chance to experience 12

247
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,510
presidencies while I was ambassador back

248
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:44,070
in Brussels but if hunts representing

249
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:46,439
Netherlands were holding the presidency

250
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,790
for 12 12 times says it doesn't matter

251
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,790
than it it really

252
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,910
this falling out now secondly it does

253
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,360
matter for another simple and obvious

254
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,399
reason because Brett is not a present of

255
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:09,130
the Union this is the presidency of the

256
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,720
council and one of the three important

257
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:15,970
institutions which are participating

258
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,130
that process any no other institution

259
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,410
states can have their share on the

260
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,360
legislative process so i think logisti i

261
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,709
mean the the presidency provides exactly

262
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,730
the instruments how to establish

263
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:31,760
ownership in legislative process now

264
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,920
back to your question blood how can we

265
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,920
sell all this back home I think there

266
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,599
are different perspective perspective

267
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,699
certainly it is a different way of

268
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,800
communication for netherlands to sell it

269
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,019
back home because there is let me put it

270
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
very bluntly there is maybe not such

271
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,339
high doses of adrenaline and

272
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,010
expectations because it's not for the

273
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:55,790
first time in slovakia i don't know how

274
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:59,000
about you in in malta I'm not facing so

275
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:02,719
far I would call it a a massive interest

276
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,360
coming from society or from media when

277
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,779
it comes to the upcoming presidency but

278
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,120
for me the the most striking point how

279
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,700
to explain back home what the presidency

280
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,510
is all about is to tell that after 11

281
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:20,260
years after we joined European Union for

282
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:24,980
the first time we will have to get

283
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:27,380
undressed of our national jersey and for

284
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,750
six months slovak presidency will have

285
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,399
to put in for forefront not its own

286
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,760
national interest because that's the

287
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:37,699
essence of presidency at but it will

288
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:40,040
have to run on behalf of 28 member

289
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:42,800
states the common European agenda and I

290
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,339
think it is good for this country to

291
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,979
really experience a new sense of

292
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,440
responsibility where permanent

293
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,829
representative peter Yarrow chick with

294
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,690
whom we swapped for six months he can

295
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:59,089
forget the narrative which I have been

296
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:01,670
using for almost six years where each

297
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:04,950
and every intervention of mine has been

298
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,079
has started with Slovakia would like to

299
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,030
say forget it for six months and I think

300
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,010
this is new experience this is a very

301
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,589
good experience I know if I were

302
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:16,800
politician I would not be very popular

303
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:19,650
if I set which is really the essence of

304
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,310
presidency and that is to serve the rest

305
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:25,260
of 28 member states within the counsel

306
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,869
to represent it externally and

307
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,760
especially with IV the rest of the of

308
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:34,230
the institution so it will be very

309
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,240
difficult task for us to to create a

310
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,850
positive narrative about presidency and

311
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,730
sell it positively back home okay we've

312
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:45,000
kind of have a snapshot idea of what the

313
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:48,720
presidencies and also why it matters now

314
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,540
let's add the other sexy world and

315
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,310
that's the trio to the picture why is

316
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:59,010
the trio important we had trio even back

317
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:02,069
before Liz memos in place it started out

318
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,980
so this is not a new thing but certainly

319
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:08,100
the ambition today of the Netherlands

320
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,320
Malta and Slovakia also being to country

321
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,370
being three countries in Schengen in

322
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,560
eurozone is to use the trio and utilize

323
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,500
the trio in a slightly different way

324
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,640
than thus far so my question is and

325
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,550
maybe I'll start with Ian here what in

326
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,160
your view since you're the last one not

327
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:31,290
you but Malta is the last one in the

328
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,630
trio what does this trio exercise mean

329
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,939
for you in terms of the preparation for

330
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:39,420
the presidency itself and for this role

331
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,850
of taking the European head-on on and

332
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,790
and taking off the National heads while

333
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:49,440
you're in Brussels but also in malta in

334
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:52,050
the early half and that 2017 I think it

335
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,450
was it was a good learning curve in the

336
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,719
past in the past year and a half

337
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,540
especially when

338
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:06,350
30 meetings were taking place in our

339
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:08,289
three capitals and together with the

340
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:14,599
council secretariat we were basically

341
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:18,189
first of all we we will be in an

342
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:22,039
18-month period where this legislature

343
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:24,110
will start to reap the fruits of the

344
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:26,990
legislative process because most of the

345
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:29,449
most of the desires will will be at a

346
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:32,929
mature stage and hopefully closed off

347
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:35,090
and therefore this is not we will not

348
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:37,400
face difficulty for instance that our

349
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,549
Italian friends had to face because you

350
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,740
had a new Parliament new commission so

351
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,270
on and so forth so basically this will

352
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,750
this will really engage in the

353
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:51,830
legislative process and will be very

354
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:54,679
busy also with some midterm reviews in

355
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:58,879
particular and I'm therefore and

356
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:02,680
therefore we we will be we will be

357
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:07,310
inundated with with with with

358
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:11,260
trial logs also later on and and

359
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:14,629
therefore the work we did in the past

360
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:18,170
where for the first time it's important

361
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,560
to mention we decided to to be in sync

362
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:25,520
with the other institutions and be more

363
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:30,169
focused those of you in the hole which

364
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:33,170
are used to to receive 30 programs of

365
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:36,580
the three of resistances basically know

366
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:39,740
that it's about over a hundred page

367
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:44,149
document it speaks about everything it

368
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:47,390
speaks about the EDD am you but it also

369
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:51,170
speaks about nutrition legislation about

370
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:53,030
obesity about sports about so you have

371
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,610
something different this time yes we

372
00:18:53,030 --> 00:19:01,190
decided as a try by the European Council

373
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:03,459
back in June 2014 5 5 issues decided by

374
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:06,800
our leaders by our head of state and

375
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:09,590
therefore be more for the due importance

376
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,230
to working parties all the working

377
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,980
parties take place but we have our our

378
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,690
focus according to what was a clam and

379
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,310
this gives us the flexibility to work on

380
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,920
the on the completion of the of the

381
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:26,470
single market the digital aspect and

382
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:30,110
that's regards migration the Numerian

383
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:33,440
our our our neighbourhood policy which

384
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:35,899
which should be now revamped because

385
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,120
it's not what we desired when the when

386
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:41,330
the neighbourhood policy was enacted

387
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:43,879
back in 2004 now we have basically a

388
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:46,010
ring of fire rather than having a

389
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,660
healthy neighborhood and therefore this

390
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,860
is what kinda tree or do in the

391
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,020
neighbourhood policy I mean this is

392
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,030
external relations which basically at

393
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:55,160
release role of the presidency here

394
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,950
through what I think that as already

395
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:02,540
mentioned also in the previous panels I

396
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:04,190
think that also a political one in the

397
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,300
sense that of course it appreciates that

398
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,390
it has to work with the other

399
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:11,000
institutions and understands of

400
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,740
government intentions are because this

401
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,470
is not a federal union this is a union

402
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,130
of members

403
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:19,049
and and therefore i think that the hard

404
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:23,100
work and the very good work being done

405
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:25,049
by the high rev mogherini is being much

406
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,270
appreciated by by the ministers for

407
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,740
foreign affairs and there's a good

408
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,789
working relationship at that level but

409
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:36,000
of course we we have to have to address

410
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:39,539
this this instability and forces for us

411
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,780
it will be an occasion to once again put

412
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:46,740
on the on the agenda also in the

413
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:49,230
informal aspect of the of the presidency

414
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,370
that is what we do in our capital and

415
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,809
the non decision binding meetings and in

416
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,049
our case on the mediterranean region

417
00:20:54,809 --> 00:21:02,908
decide them at the rain because i think

418
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:05,280
also with migration being one of the one

419
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:08,159
of the consequence challenge we all face

420
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,710
today and everybody appreciates that

421
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,530
peace and stability and the southern

422
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,190
neighborhood is not something which only

423
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:19,950
malta italy or greece would like to see

424
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,929
but but the whole continent because it's

425
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:30,179
crucial for for everyone to have to have

426
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:34,169
Libya back on its feet and and also try

427
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:37,740
to do to reach the positive results in

428
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:39,240
the rest of the north of Africa right I

429
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,090
think we kind of get a sense of the

430
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,890
multi stamp on the trio and maybe some

431
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,510
of the key issues you also want to

432
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,580
highlight in terms of your communication

433
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,520
which is very important you mentioned

434
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,178
something which is the union is the

435
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,650
union of states but of course we have

436
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,620
the institutions and we also have

437
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,169
various degree of integration of those

438
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,989
states some other things which as i did

439
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:05,850
say binds the Freezone let me ask hands

440
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:09,299
here what does this actually what could

441
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:11,549
this mean for the work program and also

442
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:13,799
actual progress where we actually have

443
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:16,559
the three countries inside the club of

444
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:19,139
the common currency so how can we

445
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,809
actually use this and perhaps unity for

446
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,120
maybe more continuity and some strategy

447
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,440
inside the eurozone I think 11 is

448
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,600
big issues would be the deposit

449
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,850
insurance system which is of course 28

450
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,080
white but it would be great if the

451
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,480
Commission indeed comes with the

452
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,699
proposal on the 0 next year and we

453
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,530
started start talking in the council

454
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,600
about this we're very good to solve that

455
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,920
presents you can take over and that it

456
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,899
could be finished off by the Maltese

457
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,940
presidency I mean this is an obvious

458
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,450
example of a trio which can work

459
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,030
together and and prepare sort of the end

460
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,440
stage and not starting all over again so

461
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,139
I think this would be a very concrete

462
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,740
example of of working together which

463
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:01,710
springs into my mind from my own work

464
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,780
okay even please what to the same

465
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,920
question can I be very open and blunt

466
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:12,720
yes my concern when it comes to trios

467
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:17,640
row and how to move forward the reform

468
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,880
agenda for for eurozone I'm not

469
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,860
concerned really at all about what the

470
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,720
president's what the three presidencies

471
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,879
should be should be doing that would be

472
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:33,360
too easy my problem is that there is a

473
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:36,840
lacking readiness to really make

474
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,449
decisive steps forward secondly those

475
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,639
decisive steps forward which are

476
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:45,330
indicated in the five presidents report

477
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:49,260
where one of the co-author was president

478
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:52,080
dies abloom are absolutely needed but

479
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,030
there is there is no debate on highest

480
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,830
political level how to make those bold

481
00:23:54,030 --> 00:24:04,350
steps can I say very bluntly that during

482
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:08,189
the eurozone crisis major revolutionary

483
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:12,480
steps forward to stabilize eurozone and

484
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:17,250
create systemic instrument where drip

485
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:20,670
where we're done once we were driven by

486
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:24,870
markets and buy market pressure and by

487
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:27,840
the crisis as such let us not be let us

488
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:30,929
not be misled by the fact that we were

489
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,240
given by the markets in a eurozone more

490
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,440
or less if we take up grease and recent

491
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,169
experience with them

492
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,899
let us not be misled we were rather

493
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:45,200
given a timeout by the markets when it

494
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:47,389
comes to hold stability of eurozone but

495
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,840
there is the same need to make bold

496
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:53,330
steps as we have seen under the peak of

497
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,250
of the crisis and the problem hands this

498
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,080
is not the vice president's report the

499
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,570
problem is not what the what the tree or

500
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,428
we'll do the problem is that there is no

501
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:06,200
debate on the highest public political

502
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:07,639
level how are we going to agree on most

503
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,610
important steps that are needed to

504
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:15,620
stabilize in a long-term perspective so

505
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:18,620
you know we have had 2010 helped me from

506
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,590
if I'm correct or not we had equally a

507
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,110
report presented by President Van Rompuy

508
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:26,600
which is equally good now we have

509
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,668
repacked it now it has a name of five

510
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,230
presidents report but I'm asking where

511
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:32,539
is the leadership to move the things

512
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,970
forward I'd be absolutely delighted

513
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:38,059
hunts and young if we could cooperate

514
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:40,730
and concrete logistic steps that you

515
00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:42,789
move ahead but I dare say here nothing

516
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,769
will move unless we will be Cleveland

517
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:48,230
unless we are given a clear political

518
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:50,840
guidance to go in that direction of

519
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:54,259
which we know will not be possible

520
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,480
unless we share more serenity between

521
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:59,690
member states and uncommon institutions

522
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:04,000
so my problem complacency in this area

523
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:06,889
and a bit lacking leadership so maybe

524
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,200
yes please it's because because I mean I

525
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:12,258
think the Giudice will just try to

526
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,600
outline that one of the first

527
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:16,549
preconditions for all this to make giant

528
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,189
steps forward which are necessary is

529
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:22,100
that we need our peoples in I mean we

530
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,679
cannot go on technocratic Lee pushing

531
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,740
out Union and eurozone and that is over

532
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,990
our populations so I mean this plea for

533
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,879
leadership is all is all fine and I like

534
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,340
it and I think it's necessary but

535
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:37,009
leadership now involves involving people

536
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,199
it doesn't mean that you sort of preach

537
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:40,700
from the council and tell people this is

538
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,799
the way we should go forward so that

539
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,929
will be my first first answer to live

540
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,820
and I fully agree with the goal but I

541
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:47,630
think that is the kind of leadership we

542
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,750
would need

543
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,400
and the second thing is to be honest my

544
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:55,730
own experience in the banking Union has

545
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,400
been Ivan that you may have very sort of

546
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,740
big concepts but the reality on the

547
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,460
ground is that you have to work very

548
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:06,440
very hard I mean I've spent 20 hours in

549
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:09,620
a row in European Parliament on the

550
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,650
other m on making the resolution

551
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,969
mechanism 20 hours of negotiations so

552
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,700
that's the kind of work you need to do

553
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,170
when being a president I think we're we

554
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,420
are able and willing to do that you're

555
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,100
able to the multis are able to and I

556
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,600
think that's sort of the value of the

557
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,669
trio but you're absolutely right i mean

558
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,980
you need to need a perspective but the

559
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:30,290
kind of leadership we need I'm totally

560
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,490
convinced that it should be I don't want

561
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,930
to be very popular it should be

562
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,580
inclusive leadership so it should be

563
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:38,120
leadership which is based on what people

564
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,850
want in my own country the subtle sexism

565
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,280
that Europe is very high I think it's

566
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,230
here the same so we need to involve our

567
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,139
people who want to go forward otherwise

568
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,550
it won't work okay i think the sense i'm

569
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,850
getting out of this is that in terms of

570
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:55,070
politics and political issues certainly

571
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:56,990
this is not going to be in in some

572
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:59,710
respects hasn't been business as usual

573
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:02,420
for some time and that's of course

574
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,100
perhaps a real qualitative change also

575
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:06,740
in terms of what the presidency and the

576
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,080
trio can achieve we have a little over

577
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,150
20 minutes to go and I'd like to open it

578
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,850
up because we touch the political issue

579
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,630
and the people to the people and the

580
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:19,100
audience here let's try to take maybe

581
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,490
one or two or three questions a series

582
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,439
and if you can be a specific and direct

583
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:26,480
a question to a specific person that's

584
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,280
great if you have a comment please try

585
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,530
to be fairly brief and also targeted who

586
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:42,950
is going to pick it up so it's hard to

587
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:46,280
break the ice and nobody we sold all

588
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,050
right we I'm not sure what this tells me

589
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:50,330
about my bunny question initially

590
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,870
there's somebody there is somebody here

591
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,870
okay

592
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:08,480
the mic is coming please thank you even

593
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:11,510
to you so I understood you told us you

594
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,160
want to work together yeah and that this

595
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,740
is needed and there are some programs

596
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:20,420
which are ongoing but I still don't get

597
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:22,430
is what is special in the presidency and

598
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,750
why we need you free to work together

599
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:29,510
what do you actually change well I can

600
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:36,920
what was it to me I mean because I know

601
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:38,900
you yes others can pick it up to you you

602
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,840
know we can I say what he is he's a good

603
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,940
friend and chairman of the goddess láska

604
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,649
because of sons collect Ronnie too much

605
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:50,540
hate one no look why this is needed that

606
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,210
we three of us not only that we are

607
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:55,639
sitting here by coincidence but there is

608
00:29:53,210 --> 00:30:00,350
this idea of trio Tomaj it is very

609
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:03,410
simple you know the one of the tasks for

610
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:06,980
presidency is to run the legislative

611
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:10,940
process and everybody knows to conclude

612
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:14,270
from legislative proposal to legislation

613
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,400
that takes a lot of time in European

614
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:21,410
Union so therefore you need to establish

615
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:23,120
certain certain continuity over time

616
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:25,370
which is longer than six months because

617
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,750
if any presidency within six months

618
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:33,139
would start to follow its own path you

619
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:36,490
would get nowhere basically so the first

620
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:40,190
fundamental fundamental intention is to

621
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:42,710
extend continuity in this case for 18

622
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,690
months of course you could ask good why

623
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,150
couldn't we have presidency for 12 the

624
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,580
turn for any member said with comes in

625
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,950
24 years how can we once in 24 years

626
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,199
then talk about ownership that the

627
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,620
country won't need to eat you for me is

628
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,420
extremely important then there are other

629
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,729
issues how to establish continuity

630
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,950
certain continuity between the two

631
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:06,500
following trio so we in Slovakia we are

632
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:07,700
already talking also with the with the

633
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,049
following

634
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:15,380
see coming after Slovakia molten and

635
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:19,100
Netherlands but this is this is it but a

636
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:21,130
lot I think will will depend on how our

637
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,990
Dutch friends will kick off

638
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:27,049
pragmatically because for them I hope

639
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,929
the trio is not ending at the moment

640
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:31,158
when they're starting their national

641
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:33,320
presidency which is January first and I

642
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:35,929
know realistically what will be in

643
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,899
forefront of your efforts is your own

644
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:41,750
national Dutch presence but may I invite

645
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:44,600
you to look a little bit beyond the

646
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:46,880
horizon of your six months and stick to

647
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,820
what we have I think successfully

648
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,299
started to to identify the areas where

649
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:55,908
we could get three of us a bit more as

650
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:58,340
if we went just individually for six

651
00:31:55,909 --> 00:32:05,210
months six months targets if you want

652
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:10,158
hmm we have more questions Yosef we

653
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:13,010
can't front please yeah here you got to

654
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,120
know it was about the Romanians

655
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:18,620
University Department of Political

656
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:20,870
Science now obviously the idea of the

657
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,820
three presidencies working together is

658
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,699
indeed a good one because one presidency

659
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:27,320
in six months cannot achieve much

660
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,299
coordination is really important over a

661
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,149
longer period of time the question of

662
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:34,610
course is these three countries are

663
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:36,110
eurozone member countries and the kind

664
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,510
of debate we're having about the

665
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:41,840
developments in the EU right now is how

666
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:43,279
do we keep all this together now the

667
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,649
kinds of proposals that are on the table

668
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,389
within the eurozone about the deepening

669
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:49,820
of integration in the eurozone that's

670
00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:52,549
all fine but we also need to make sure

671
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:56,269
that these presidencies keep the EU

672
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:59,539
together as a positive project so how do

673
00:32:56,269 --> 00:33:01,970
you guys think about the involvement of

674
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:03,408
non eurozone countries in the

675
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,830
development of the institutional

676
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:09,139
infrastructure of the eurozone okay Hans

677
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,100
please sort of yeah I think what's in

678
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:11,990
the for it's a very good question

679
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,389
because what's in the forefront of our

680
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,919
minds is of course that we face a

681
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:17,080
certain country which will have a

682
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,720
referendum

683
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,990
being in union or not so that's very

684
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,760
important for us so we will having the

685
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:28,080
eurozone presidency and the echofon

686
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:30,580
presidency we will do our utmost just to

687
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,179
let out the integration of the eurozone

688
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:37,149
go along with trying to involve the outs

689
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,760
and that's of course a big issue for us

690
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:42,160
and I think it's shared by my colleagues

691
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,100
on on the stage here we want to work on

692
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:48,100
this and we work very concretely on this

693
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,649
so we will try to involve the outs as

694
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,810
much as possible in eurozone discussion

695
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,270
actually when we try when we were

696
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:57,190
talking Ivan knows he's been there when

697
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,870
we're talking about the five presence

698
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:01,030
report we're not talking about is in

699
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,030
Eurogroup we're doing this knack of it

700
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:08,050
all right so this is sort of a sign that

701
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:10,389
it's also important for them he also

702
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,610
actually raised the issue of a possible

703
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,230
breaks in and we'll have the UK minister

704
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:16,720
for Europe speaking after coffee break

705
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:18,460
so I'm very grateful but I think this is

706
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,709
a very pertinent question how do we keep

707
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,960
it all together and the relationship

708
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,440
between the ins and outs is one of the

709
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,120
key ones even wanting to react quickly

710
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,080
from our own national perspective I

711
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:35,469
think it is key to to really undertaken

712
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:40,569
try everything to avoid a divide between

713
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:43,270
the ins and the outs because I learned

714
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:46,300
in England two weeks ago that the the

715
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:48,730
camp of those were advocating outs they

716
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,340
used to refer to them as two out this so

717
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,650
between ins and outs why is it Slavic

718
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,480
interest let me say it very bluntly to

719
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:58,900
having check friends in the audience

720
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,150
slovak interest is to have wish I grad

721
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,220
as soon as we can in the eurozone this

722
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:07,030
is Slavic slovak interest why should I

723
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:09,850
say that in order to get it we in

724
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:12,040
Slovakia we here we have to really do

725
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,730
everything where we can that that the

726
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,200
rest I mean in Michigan which is not in

727
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:19,240
you will not get a feeling that their

728
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,069
subject of our decisions that we take

729
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,649
within the eurozone but heavily impact

730
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:26,530
on them because no doubt what we are

731
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:30,530
doing while deepening you know eurozone

732
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:33,580
while banking Union it does have in

733
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:36,050
act on internal market and therefore I

734
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,120
totally understand British friends when

735
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,860
they say we have to resolve this because

736
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,620
they are proponents of a very strong

737
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,980
internal market but in no way in no way

738
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,990
it must happen that this is to the

739
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,690
detriment of those who are not there at

740
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:54,410
the same time hands may I say they must

741
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:57,200
not have a veto over what is needed to

742
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:59,149
be done at on the level of eurozone to

743
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,910
make it more stable so we have to find a

744
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:05,270
solution which that's my point is

745
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:08,660
extremely important for for slovakia and

746
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:12,200
if we can do something as a trio for

747
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:14,810
that to establish a reassurance for

748
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,609
those who are not yet there that they

749
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,850
should not be afraid of what we are

750
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,470
doing that that will not be to the

751
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:24,230
detriment of their interests I think it

752
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:26,600
would be excellent achievement of course

753
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,730
that's one view how to approach the

754
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:31,670
issue and a fairly positive and

755
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,710
optimistic we all know at the same time

756
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,440
eurozone enlargement is not in the cards

757
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,930
anytime soon and of course the debate is

758
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:43,750
rather driven by other issues such as

759
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:49,009
how to keep the separation firmer

760
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:52,280
without imposing costs on those who are

761
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:54,380
out that certainly the British align in

762
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,610
what's the debate like in multan is of

763
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,550
course Malta is a bit of a different

764
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:00,560
story because you had a much bigger

765
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,600
internal debate on a very membership in

766
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,560
the European Union before you join but

767
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:09,319
you did join the euro even before we did

768
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:11,180
so what's the view on Malta if I can put

769
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,650
it a bit more specifically on the whole

770
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:19,540
brexit issue yes and and even though

771
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:19,540
membership was was he debated

772
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:24,430
moulton our European parliamentary

773
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:27,220
elections and they're like slovakia we

774
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:30,879
had the last ones and I'm there for now

775
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:34,450
the Maltese population is clean envy you

776
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,060
and therefore that's not an issue any

777
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:39,279
longer actually political parties or

778
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:43,000
compu man the state that is Malta and

779
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,090
when it comes when it comes to the two

780
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,580
also to the brexit of course last year

781
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:51,130
we celebrated our 50th anniversary

782
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:55,540
together with the UK since our

783
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:58,120
independence and whilst Europe is

784
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,250
important for the UK I think we have to

785
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,319
admit that also the UK is important for

786
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:07,930
the European project and therefore

787
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:11,320
whilst we we would like to see this

788
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:15,430
issue resolved positively by the by the

789
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:19,000
UK population of course we should not

790
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:21,370
rush into starting to mention things

791
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,190
like 32 changes so on and so forth

792
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:28,240
because I think that this this can even

793
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:32,650
scare even further our our our citizens

794
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:37,379
I mean I've been impressed in the past

795
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:37,380
year and a half speaking to to the Dutch

796
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:44,390
colleagues about sexism in a founding

797
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,460
member state but look look at the

798
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:51,400
Netherlands they are approaching it in a

799
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:54,170
more pragmatic way like like involving

800
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,760
proposing to involve more the national

801
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:59,060
parliaments when it comes to legislation

802
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,490
and therefore deciding what can be

803
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:05,180
decided at national level and then of

804
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:08,870
course discuss short competencies at EU

805
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:12,890
level and and I'm pretty sure that if we

806
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:15,170
communicate all together the importance

807
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:20,740
of this European project it is still

808
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:25,340
very relevant in 2015 and definitely

809
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:29,180
whilst not at any cost but we all do

810
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:33,080
hope that that the UK will remain of

811
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,460
course part of this of this union we all

812
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,990
hope but I guess we also have to get

813
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:37,760
ready for the unexpected and maybe

814
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,169
that's also one of the tasks of the trio

815
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,930
we can get to that but this issue is

816
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,730
finally catching some attention we have

817
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,919
several hands up let's take the

818
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:49,420
gentleman the back and then mr. Taylor

819
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,950
here let's take two questions please yes

820
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,220
Charles tannic and I particularly want

821
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:57,399
to direct my question at the maltese

822
00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:01,129
representative because one of the big

823
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,140
nebulous myths being spun by those who

824
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,630
wish for the United Kingdom to leave the

825
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,150
European Union is this concept of the

826
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,510
Anglos fear which is basically the

827
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:13,160
Commonwealth and the United States and

828
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:15,020
Malta is unique in the European Union

829
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,000
along with Cyprus has been Commonwealth

830
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:20,540
countries as well as EU member states

831
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,310
and it could be possibly that during the

832
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,710
slow bat presidency will be right in the

833
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:27,320
middle of the brexit campaign and my

834
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:29,120
challenge to mr. Muscat who was an MEP

835
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,190
colleague by the way another example of

836
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,670
an MEP who's been our prime minister is

837
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:36,350
to simply say will lead us the

838
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:38,390
leadership of your country who as you

839
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,850
said before went through a Euroskeptic

840
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:44,240
split between the labor and the more

841
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:46,009
conservatives come out firmly and saying

842
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,600
it's in Maltese and Commonwealth

843
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,340
interests for Britain to stay in the

844
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,900
European Union and that this kind of

845
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,120
angler

846
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,640
via concept is really just a complete

847
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:56,259
myth there's no such thing and that

848
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,779
really Malta and you do have quite a

849
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:01,000
large diaspora community in the United

850
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:04,120
Kingdom who will be entitled to vote on

851
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,730
brexit unlike slow backs and polls and

852
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,049
others your people your your citizens

853
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,240
living in that akeem that will be able

854
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:12,670
to vote so my appeal to all Commonwealth

855
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,410
leaders right now is to rubbish this

856
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,540
whole anglosphere concept because you

857
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:20,170
know better than most thank you this is

858
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:23,080
really getting us on that tricky line in

859
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:25,030
terms of management the of the business

860
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,590
and the national questions but but those

861
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,910
are real things so I'll get it back to

862
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:29,800
you but let me take the question here

863
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:32,140
and then we'll kick it back to the panel

864
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,380
following on an amen to rubbishing the

865
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:38,980
anglers discussion do you think it would

866
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:43,890
do any harm if the United Kingdom wanted

867
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:47,200
it to culture multi currency union

868
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:48,910
because some people think it's just a

869
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,040
form of words and it's a recognition of

870
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:54,270
reality since there are two member

871
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,580
states at least that have permanent

872
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:59,290
derogations from the euro others fear

873
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,730
that it might encourage some of your

874
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:05,590
neighbors I think of Poland in

875
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:08,020
particular to want to unwind its treaty

876
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,940
commitment to join the euro thank you

877
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,950
great this is a very pertinent question

878
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,660
also the presidency because we get to

879
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,250
the nitty-gritty of wording and

880
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,620
negotiations do we have any more

881
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:19,210
questions at this point yes please let's

882
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:22,000
take another one and then we'll get it

883
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:25,440
back panelist it's a lady at the front

884
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,440
please microphone

885
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:35,670
thank you my question is about factor of

886
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:38,609
unexpected because in every presidency

887
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:43,890
that there is a crisis bigger or a

888
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:46,740
smaller one that causes let's say a

889
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:49,500
shift of the agenda of the presidency

890
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,720
and that could lead for some issues in

891
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,240
their cheddar having to be tackled by

892
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,459
the next presidency and the one who

893
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,850
follows coordination is needed as you

894
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:03,570
said but how can you let's say prepare

895
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:06,509
for these short crises and my second

896
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:09,570
question is to mr. core talk we have a

897
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:11,610
special case with la vecchia having a

898
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:14,970
national elections just before you

899
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:17,010
assume your presidency and people

900
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:20,819
sometimes make the difference and is

901
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:24,540
that a an additional fact that you have

902
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:26,640
to coordinate in the domestic scene with

903
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,800
other parties before the election so

904
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,049
that you can have a successful outcome

905
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,450
of the election thank you thank you

906
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:35,010
excellent questions both really two

907
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,560
presidents the end in domestic context

908
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:41,010
let's start with Hans if I may say so

909
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:44,549
and try to tackle two issues maybe one

910
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:46,260
is the multi currency union and the

911
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,390
second one is how do you get ready for

912
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:52,380
the unexpected which of course the dodgy

913
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:55,259
have had some experience with you on the

914
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,880
multi-currency you know I'm a guess I'm

915
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:02,160
not going to negotiate about is on the

916
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:04,230
stage on the unexpected how do you

917
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,420
perspective but the only thing I can say

918
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,190
about this is that indeed the fact that

919
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,960
you're trying to work together with your

920
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,580
colleagues in the coming one and out

921
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,980
here does help that we also have

922
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,529
eurozone presidency so we can we do have

923
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,120
some ways of dealing with this but I

924
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:21,270
mean if you look at for example the

925
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:23,490
migrant crisis well i don't think the

926
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:26,490
looks of our presidency actually prepare

927
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,140
for that and if we would get to go back

928
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,740
to the other two gentlemen if we look at

929
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,740
a 00

930
00:44:34,990 --> 00:45:11,979
32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32

931
00:44:51,970 --> 00:45:32,500
32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32

932
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:57,010
32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 3 333333

933
00:45:32,500 --> 00:46:00,010
3333 333333 3333 3 333333 3333 333333

934
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,010
3333

935
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:38,299
32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32 32
