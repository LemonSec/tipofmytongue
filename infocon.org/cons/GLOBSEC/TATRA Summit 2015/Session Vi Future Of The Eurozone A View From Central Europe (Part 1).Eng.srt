1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:12,290
names are correct and we have you as a

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,290
lady from Hungary hey dr. Peter Casimir

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:21,180
but isn't it names are not correct was

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:27,119
it again um and then the other person

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:32,610
because the name son okay and the lady

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:35,760
is called again Roscoe bye okay welcome

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,960
back for a session which I think links

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,910
up very well with the previous session

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,469
but a bit a different perspective I just

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:45,328
mentioned to my panel members that one

11
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,399
of the interesting things I found of the

12
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,379
tatra so me that I get me coming from

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,860
Brussels I come from a think tank and

14
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,019
receps that each time I come here I have

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,420
a different perspective on economic

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,329
policymaking than what I hear or what I

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,309
feel in Brussels process has a very much

18
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,099
of a Western European view on these

19
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,200
things but have you come here you come

20
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,880
home with a different view and that's

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,830
what I would like to get from this panel

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,610
as well so we will have a discussion

23
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,009
unfortunately the person from Poland

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,110
couldn't be here because his plane

25
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,740
couldn't get off because of in

26
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,869
Poland so but we have the three other

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,509
physical countries represented and we

28
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:31,770
can have a good discussion about

29
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:34,950
economic policymaking economic policy

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,960
making a scene from the new member

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,659
states from three important new member

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,610
states and then of course put it in the

33
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,479
context of what is being the cost at the

34
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,520
eurozone level at the European level I

35
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,710
have a series of questions which we

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,979
discussed just which we have prepared

37
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,630
which we discussed before my intentions

38
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,539
that we go through some of these

39
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,548
questions we have some replies from the

40
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,020
different representatives and then I can

41
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,700
throw it open for questions from your

42
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,369
side I will also see what is coming up

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,290
through this sliggoo system that they

44
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,679
can raise questions with you but so

45
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,859
please don't hesitate to be

46
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,129
active right away we would just start

47
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:18,260
with a general issue which was again

48
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:20,810
already touched on this morning by

49
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,200
amongst others Commissioner or vice

50
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:27,769
president dombrovskis this morning the

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,138
Commission released its new forecast so

52
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,790
what are the perspectives for the

53
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:34,849
eurozone what are the perspective

54
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,590
overall II for the EU economically we've

55
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,858
heard some people saying look we are

56
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,560
still not out of the woods yet audra

57
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,090
saying the perspectives are good of

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,650
course they are not tremendous it's not

59
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,139
like in the United States but we still

60
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,959
foresee a growth of about 1.6 1.8

61
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:53,989
percent for this year even more probably

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,669
for next year so I want to see what is

63
00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:01,760
your perspective of the eurozone

64
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:03,500
eurozone or you yes are you actually the

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,730
stability and prosperity of the eurozone

66
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:11,060
is our utmost interest we are a small

67
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:14,510
open economy highly interconnected with

68
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,760
the eurozone countries there is a need

69
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,429
for the economies to become more

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,698
resilient through implementing deeper

71
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,010
integration and we fully understand that

72
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:27,439
however the approach to euro and no

73
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:32,649
neural area member should stay balanced

74
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:37,459
and we believe that the European Union

75
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:40,040
good a lot of imported steps and yes

76
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:43,370
this European semester with this

77
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:49,638
important tool and we really welcome its

78
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:51,259
improvement okay mrs. lesson or you

79
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:56,180
finished or maybe I can continue later

80
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:59,779
on I ok all right so as we see it of

81
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,269
course from the Hungarian viewpoint for

82
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,819
us of course the eurozone and Western

83
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,560
Europe's crows is a crucial importance

84
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:08,750
just as in the case of the Czech

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,030
Republic given the openness of the

86
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,430
economy and of course our major market

87
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:17,449
sell in Europe and of course with gross

88
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:19,489
demand is also increasing to cut it

89
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:22,060
short I think that the situation is

90
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,770
improving probably a little bit slow

91
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,340
word and expected one year or two years

92
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,620
ago but still a steady slow increase is

93
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:33,630
visible and that's important and that's

94
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:36,190
good news for us the second point that

95
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,740
compared with the growth figures

96
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,300
basically growth figures of the Central

97
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,350
and Eastern Europe it's probably much

98
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:47,470
smaller in hunger for instance last year

99
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,010
we had a 3.7 person grows quite robust

100
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,960
this year that will be somewhat lower

101
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,300
three-point-one percent which means that

102
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,090
it is almost a double or sometimes the

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,790
double of the european level and that's

104
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:04,539
good because that gives us at least a

105
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,030
little possibility to converge in real

106
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,330
terms of course that still will be a

107
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,880
long road but we are happy that the

108
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,639
situation is even steadily but slowly

109
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,159
and slowly improving and that gives more

110
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,720
possibilities for Hungary and I also

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,740
think that the other central Eastern

112
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,600
European economies okay and then the

113
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,110
other on the eurozone member in the

114
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,419
group this obviously only your area

115
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,060
member state representative in the panel

116
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:36,609
I should probably focus first of all on

117
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,010
the realities of the eurozone which are

118
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,660
often not so shiny and I'm not talking

119
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,479
about the economic prospects now but

120
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,700
rather from the institutional point of

121
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,570
view and probably throughout the panel

122
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:52,060
will get to brighter perspectives on

123
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:56,320
euro area and future membership of other

124
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:01,240
wish you had four beers so what I recall

125
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:04,630
from my very short appointment in the in

126
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:08,320
this position is that there are many

127
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:10,360
many periods of serious distress where

128
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,840
we witness that the euro was so to say

129
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,009
on the on the edge of the cliff and this

130
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,229
definitely

131
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:23,749
that's so so I recall as the feeling of

132
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:27,619
uncertainty and this is something this

133
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:30,050
constant crisis mode some over over the

134
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:32,899
past couple of years definitely reduces

135
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:35,659
the attractiveness of this club for for

136
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:40,520
our colleagues in poland czech republic

137
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:43,308
or hungary and these doubts about the

138
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,529
one-way ticket to the monetary union

139
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:48,830
that we wit inside this summer or in the

140
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:51,889
summer of two thousand twelve are a

141
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:55,599
clear signal that we should be really

142
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:58,879
more proactive instead of just just just

143
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,919
reacting and so one one hand I do

144
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:04,279
definitely understand the concerns of

145
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:06,229
our which grad neighbors they will think

146
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,080
twice basically before they give up

147
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:10,849
their monetary autonomy on the other

148
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,669
hand I totally understand also their

149
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:16,069
concerns that the EU is a sort of a

150
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:19,758
two-speed model at its present

151
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:23,509
functioning and less this could

152
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,680
complicate their perspective perspective

153
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:29,870
of their future joining of the of the

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:33,439
euro euro zone and and I think like

155
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,749
sawaki ml might feel the same if we were

156
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,089
in their shoes so basically these are

157
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:40,629
just the opening remarks and hopefully

158
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:44,120
further in the panel we can get to some

159
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,979
as I said brightest perspectives okay

160
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,779
thank you I mean he already hinted that

161
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,149
the question I wanted to raise but I

162
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,649
probably will do it only in a moment

163
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:53,749
that's who would become the next member

164
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,009
of the eurozone you can think about it

165
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:56,839
and then I probably throw it to you

166
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:58,969
let's say for a question but we could

167
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,740
probably first say I mean we have seen

168
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:03,589
that the ECB has done important efforts

169
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,629
of the last say two or three years even

170
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:07,879
more but certainly has started with the

171
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:11,149
squandered division about eight to ten

172
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:12,860
months ago we just have facilitated the

173
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:14,659
prospects for joining the eurozone

174
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,479
because if i look at the country which

175
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:18,830
we are missing in this panel poland was

176
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,719
often mentioned as being the country

177
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,099
hood could join the euro zone but then

178
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:23,930
they said yeah but this exchange rate is

179
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,878
too high here it will be uncompetitive

180
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,379
and attractive for us know what

181
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,440
quantitive easing have we've seen the

182
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,850
euro

183
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
the exchange rate to the dollar to the

184
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,630
pound sterling has the client has

185
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,700
declined importantly apparently not as

186
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,500
much towards hungry and Czech Republic

187
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:42,240
yeah it would be very close to an

188
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,190
exception than the question of

189
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,140
quantitative easing exchange rate

190
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,890
movements might have a question but of

191
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,280
course I think that we are further away

192
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:56,130
still of the decision about when and how

193
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,540
to get to the eurozone and that opens up

194
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,370
the broad question which my colleague

195
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:04,290
has already made the reference to that

196
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,320
after there is two different eurozone's

197
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,270
the eurozone before the crisis and the

198
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,170
post-crisis you resolve and

199
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,480
qualitatively that's two different

200
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,930
things in the sense that there was a

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,150
strong belief before the crisis that the

202
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,849
eurozone membership is a kind of a

203
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:24,180
guarantee a guarantee that a state in

204
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,710
any cases cannot go bankrupt and we have

205
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,109
seen through the crisis that did

206
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:31,350
balloons this premium of your membership

207
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:34,170
is not evident I mean the developments

208
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,510
in certain countries which certain

209
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,500
canted got very very close to go

210
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:43,890
bankrupt in de facto proof that it isn't

211
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,160
there is no absolute assurance contrary

212
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,620
the heterogeneity of the level avocado

213
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,750
the level of economic development in

214
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,390
certain countries is a danger and the

215
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,580
risk that means that convergence that

216
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,860
especially not nominal convergence but

217
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,470
real convergence has become even more

218
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:04,650
important than we believed before the

219
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,840
crisis so a main point at first I think

220
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:10,610
at least from the Hungarian viewpoint we

221
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:13,050
have to work hard to achieve a real

222
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,410
convergence and get close to the EU

223
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:19,640
eurozone average otherwise you might

224
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,709
risk many things the second path should

225
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:26,310
reinvigorate itself how if I can I put

226
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:30,960
it in another form the eurozone used to

227
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:36,290
be very sexy before the crisis and it

228
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:41,040
once has to make some make up whatever I

229
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,670
don't suggest any plastic surgery but it

230
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,280
has to be

231
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,410
more sexy for the outsiders certain

232
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,270
sense except the elements should be

233
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:51,150
reinforced it has to be attractive once

234
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,850
again and it is and it is clear that

235
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,980
much more hard work is beef at least

236
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,410
from Hungarian viewpoint is before us in

237
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,390
real convergence then we fought before

238
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,610
the crisis and that's one of the lessons

239
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:06,240
and this from this point of view the

240
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:08,970
monetary policy autonomy we see now and

241
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,870
it is proved that we were lucky enough

242
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:15,630
to have the monetary policy autonomy to

243
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,330
play to adjust and having the exchange

244
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:21,240
rates flexibility to react on the

245
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,860
different impacts of the crisis I stop

246
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,720
here I have many other comments here but

247
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,460
I don't want to monopolize the Reno I

248
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,900
wanted to raise the same question with

249
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:32,910
Monsieur discover from czech republic on

250
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,010
well the czech republic still does not

251
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:37,230
have the final date for joining the

252
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,410
eurozone however we have committed

253
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:43,140
ourselves to prepare or arrangement so

254
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:45,959
to make it possible but at the end it

255
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:49,740
will be the political decision of the

256
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,650
expect maybe of the next government we

257
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,430
observe with a particle interest rakia

258
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:59,400
from its adoption of euro and especially

259
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:02,760
during the recent the eurozone turbulent

260
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:06,449
seas its most revealing example for us

261
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,400
because our economies are had a common

262
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:11,460
past are still we have a lot of

263
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,050
similarities and absolutely agreed with

264
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,570
with the words of our Hungarian

265
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,449
colleague that now it's quite a

266
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:22,770
difficult time for the eurozone and for

267
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:25,920
doing a decision to enter it it will not

268
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,750
be a easy one if I remember many people

269
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,640
in this audience will remember eurozone

270
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,260
membership is automatic meaning once you

271
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,480
meet the criteria I don't know exactly

272
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,730
the criteria Mindy on inflation on the

273
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,480
long term whatever the long-term

274
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:43,920
interest rates and then the movement

275
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,450
within the band exactly so yeah and on

276
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,709
the debt-to-gdp but then if it does not

277
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,410
the problems we know let's say for the

278
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,930
new member states so basically once you

279
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,149
meet the criteria are you join

280
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,239
i would i would precise a bit the

281
00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:00,149
accession is not automatic for two

282
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,460
reasons first I mean there are certain

283
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,360
rules of the game in the treaty and as

284
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,830
you have mentioned the so-called

285
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,510
Maastricht criteria and this is really

286
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,880
fiscal deficit below three percent but

287
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,250
now of course with a stability and

288
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,870
growth pact it is not the headline three

289
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:19,170
percent inflation but the structural

290
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,209
inflation should be in order so it has

291
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,029
become a little bit more difficult to

292
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:25,890
achieve but it can be achieved and it is

293
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:29,100
achieved for the time being for instance

294
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:31,800
by Hungary the public depth ratio which

295
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,529
by principle should be below sixty

296
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,160
percent as I look around in the European

297
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:40,320
Union I would I would pick up very small

298
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,260
number of countries being under sixty

299
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,180
percent if I can pick out some countries

300
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,580
under sixty percent they will be found

301
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,439
mostly in the central and eastern part

302
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,800
of the European Union and not on the

303
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,800
western part on the third element that

304
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,779
it has to be in in the western part of

305
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,109
the European Union that's increasing

306
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:03,270
still the public depth GDP ratio in most

307
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,940
countries in scent and Eastern Europe it

308
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:10,140
is decreasing in Hungary in the last

309
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:13,260
five years we have decreased it by a by

310
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,939
seven percent so it's decreasing going

311
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,360
against the general trend of the

312
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,760
European Union it could of course be a

313
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,220
faster process but there are realities

314
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,319
of life for the further element

315
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,110
long-term interest rates no problem with

316
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,680
that but the point here is that you have

317
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:34,589
to spend two years with the EA erm to

318
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,800
which is a kind of an exchange rate test

319
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:42,540
if you wish compared to the euro you

320
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:44,670
have to be an low inflation inflation at

321
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,189
least at the level of the three best

322
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,800
performing countries of the European

323
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:53,540
Union which today as mind once these all

324
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:57,000
criteria are met you are you can ask for

325
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,890
joining for the euro but it is getting

326
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,610
again getting more complicated than that

327
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:05,260
why because since then the banking Union

328
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,320
has been established

329
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:12,580
and the banking Union is a kind of an

330
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,150
automatic institution or umbrella for

331
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:18,850
all eurozone member countries so as

332
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:21,400
never a country before joining the euro

333
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,490
has tested what about the banking Union

334
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,150
but it's not very complicated to see the

335
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:30,610
scenario if one country among our Poland

336
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,880
Czech Republic or hungry would ask for

337
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:38,320
the Euro membership the banking Union

338
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:42,220
test should be taken and of course there

339
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,010
is another new implicit i would say

340
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,740
implicit requirement to be part of the

341
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:50,380
european union and if we go ahead with

342
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,510
the five presidents reports and fiscal

343
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,270
union and all these new institutions

344
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:58,090
proposed and it might be in place all

345
00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:00,790
these issues when you are getting closer

346
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,010
to the Euro membership eurozone

347
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,469
membership these will be these questions

348
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,680
are you able and willing to and capable

349
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:10,570
to join these structures so you mean the

350
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,180
implicit test for joining the eurozone

351
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,100
is what is recently five present support

352
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,349
these issues like I mean the willingness

353
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,120
to be part of natural closer Union to

354
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,900
move towards fiscal union that's part of

355
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,810
your implicit 'used what I mean that if

356
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,030
I am from the outside and so far before

357
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,180
the crisis I only have to look at the

358
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:34,089
maestra criteria now there are new

359
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,130
additional implicit elements which has

360
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,410
to be taken into consideration and

361
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:44,620
probably these institutions the banking

362
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:48,540
Union will be responsible to measure to

363
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:51,010
test that the new applicant is able and

364
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,800
I one had able to meet the conditions

365
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,420
and and can meet the conditions and that

366
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,469
is an additional burden that's what I

367
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:02,349
mean that new requirements emerged after

368
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:04,660
the crisis and maybe in the future as

369
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:08,050
the perspectives the new structures will

370
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:10,570
come out again new requirements if you

371
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,669
appear on the scene thank you I mean

372
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,619
gonna have your view miss euros kovanda

373
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:17,290
let's say whether you see there are more

374
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:18,159
requirements now to join this monetary

375
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,540
union which are

376
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,880
implicit which are there which are not

377
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:25,030
yet rendered explicit like for example

378
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,200
as you were saying banking Union can you

379
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,730
join the banking you meaning the

380
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,830
additional stress test for the financial

381
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,170
system and then other things which are

382
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,730
brought up in whatever the fiscal

383
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,130
convergent process which we want to

384
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,280
achieve and that I will turn to you but

385
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,220
you're part of the eurozone already

386
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:44,110
don't worry for him now but absolutely

387
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,140
agreed you know the criterion each day

388
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,840
are much more complex than just fulfill

389
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:55,200
the conversion criterion as I mentioned

390
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,070
by the beginning you know now it's

391
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,860
important to focus more on a

392
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,899
macroeconomic analysis focused on

393
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,600
competitiveness or for absence of

394
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:12,100
macroeconomic imbalances or a lot a lot

395
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:15,879
of other indicators which are servile

396
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:19,949
settle at the beginning are not directly

397
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:23,260
influenced by quantitative easing which

398
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:29,190
as we discussed before can help in some

399
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:31,690
ways but not in this point of view okay

400
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,370
you want to add something as a eurozone

401
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,870
member state whether you see it I mean

402
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:38,979
you have joined in 2009 which was you're

403
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,780
already in the midst of the crisis i

404
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,370
must say look good you see this is

405
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,700
constraining know that your members of

406
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:48,010
the of the eurozone or on the contrary

407
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,560
well if I may I would not like to

408
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,570
address directly this question and

409
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,399
probably if you heard the minister

410
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,439
talking in the previous panel he said

411
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,570
like yes it was a very unfortunate time

412
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,850
to join the eurozone like our experience

413
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:04,300
with it was always the experience of a

414
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,969
crisis so I bet that's what I indicated

415
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,070
and that's what I subscribe to but as I

416
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,840
said there are there are very many

417
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,639
reasons to believe it's good to be in

418
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,470
eurozone and they're very many reasons

419
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:19,510
to believe that the future membership of

420
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:21,790
our mission got beers is is something

421
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,520
desirable i could see i could observe

422
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,710
that the knowledge of the accession

423
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,299
criteria is in hangar is brilliant so i

424
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,279
think

425
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,139
are your ready to join me I almost

426
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,820
forgot like what is all cried master

427
00:19:31,139 --> 00:19:36,748
criteria like a session criteria I had

428
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:40,049
also almost so I had to think hard yes

429
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:41,940
but yeah you started at least part of

430
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:45,179
the panel with a question of the ECB and

431
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,710
i believe the ECB did already what was

432
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:49,950
necessary is doing what is necessary

433
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:54,090
either with eq your or omt but i believe

434
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:58,710
that we should not let the ECB the only

435
00:19:54,090 --> 00:20:01,289
actor working in this area and there has

436
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,139
to be probably some more risk takers I

437
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:05,940
know like it's a lot of member states

438
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:07,918
are reluctant to that but I believe that

439
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,019
as it happened with the amount of

440
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,029
monetary policy that was basically

441
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:15,899
shifted to the central level at least in

442
00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:19,409
some part some macro economic

443
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,389
stabilization function should be shifted

444
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:24,830
even in a fiscal area to to the central

445
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:27,418
and we should not forget that the

446
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,029
eurozone or the creation of the economic

447
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,399
and monetary union was meant to be to

448
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:34,769
the benefit of stability of the whole EU

449
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:37,498
and therefore it is in the interest of

450
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:43,440
everybody inside or outside eurozone to

451
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:47,399
to to work on the eurozone in in terms

452
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,859
of it being a the stability Haven it was

453
00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:51,570
promoted to be which is right now we

454
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,460
don't see that way but it was and I

455
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,350
believe there are still very high

456
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,739
chances that it will be in the future so

457
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:02,340
that you will not hesitate but you will

458
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:03,929
rush to join the eurozone very soon can

459
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,999
I just raise a question to the audience

460
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:08,159
whether anybody has a view who will be

461
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,600
the next to join the eurozone send

462
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,359
coming from this side of Europe then

463
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,449
from the site where I'm coming from so

464
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:17,009
nobody has a view on this otherwise

465
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,659
we'll have to take a vote probably and

466
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,460
put three or four countries on I don't

467
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:23,399
know who masters this voting system and

468
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,179
you could put who knows Czech Republic

469
00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:29,658
Hungary Poland on the list

470
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:32,210
I don't think Bulgaria Romania are very

471
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:35,149
soon likely members of the eurozone or

472
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,950
the point is and Croatia but of course

473
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:39,830
Croatia has only joined year and a half

474
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:43,279
ago probably a bit too early the point

475
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:46,490
is it and it really shows the difference

476
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,529
how we have looked upon the eurozone

477
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,289
before the crisis and how we look upon

478
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:54,559
after the crisis that there was really a

479
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:56,779
kind of a implicit competition if you

480
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,330
wish who will join first who will be the

481
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:01,220
second and and thats really was in the

482
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:04,699
minds of the people everybody's people

483
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:07,129
we had certain beliefs and confidence in

484
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,639
the eurozone now I think this

485
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:12,439
competition is a way so we I think in

486
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:15,740
central Eastern Europe those who are

487
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,369
outside of the eurozone yet realize that

488
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:22,039
first we has to make ourself feet for

489
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:25,070
being in the eurozone it's nice that i

490
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:27,799
want to go to the olympic games but i am

491
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:30,320
not trained for i can be a spectator but

492
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:33,499
if as real sportsman wants to

493
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,860
participate in the olympic games first

494
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:39,919
necessary training preparation many

495
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:43,158
competitions where he qualifies or she

496
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,379
qualifies is necessary so we at least in

497
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,230
hungary we don't feel ourselves strong

498
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:50,779
enough to compete for the membership at

499
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,299
this moment of time but i want to make

500
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:55,850
one thing very clear that the legal

501
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:58,940
obligation for hunger is evident yes it

502
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,769
is in the in the treaty we of course at

503
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:04,029
a certain moment of time will join the

504
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:08,330
euro but it is not a short term

505
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:11,720
objective yet as soon as our structural

506
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:15,080
adjustments larger market pass a labour

507
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:18,820
market participation our competitiveness

508
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:21,649
and I don't but really the qualitative

509
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,769
economic development will arrive to a

510
00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:27,408
maturity than of course it will be then

511
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:29,480
it will be somewhat automatic that the

512
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:31,850
political and economic decision will

513
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,970
come we can now reap the benefits of

514
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:37,158
being part of the eurozone but we have

515
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,140
done in the last five years a lot of

516
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,270
structural reforms

517
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,880
lots of transformation in the economy

518
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:47,360
improve competitiveness but we are still

519
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,160
not yet there okay miss you discover you

520
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,600
want to add something on this issue we

521
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,290
have no probably discussed that already

522
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,209
at length about this bad weather

523
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,649
eurozone membership is automatic whether

524
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,950
you ready for it who will be the next

525
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,090
member i also think mr. dombrovskis

526
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,130
Commissioner Dombrowski said this

527
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,020
morning the Commission will be start

528
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,460
working on review of the treaty I mean

529
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,720
once you say the things which we were

530
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,490
just saying probably will have to review

531
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,900
the treaty that the master criteria say

532
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,580
that membership is no longer automatic

533
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,070
and that the Masters criteria have to be

534
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,199
extended to these implicit things which

535
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:20,810
are in there which already forecasts a

536
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,790
very difficult kind of decision of the

537
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:25,240
Treaty which will last many many years

538
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:29,840
we could before we come to an agreement

539
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,790
it's a studio first question it's

540
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,340
difficult to say now we will be the

541
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:38,180
first country from from dimension will

542
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:41,149
join the euro zone but definitely if

543
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:44,780
when this happen it may be a motivation

544
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:48,020
or factor a push for other countries to

545
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:51,290
join our Tresor thinking about joining

546
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:53,780
Kyra's own ass to the czech republic i

547
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:58,460
think that the czech republic fulfill

548
00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:01,490
most of the criterion of the joining but

549
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:06,860
still we have not applied for the am i'm

550
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:08,750
to mechanism but as I said previously in

551
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:12,620
my country it will be primarily

552
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:14,240
political decision to join and it's

553
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,239
expected i do not think that this

554
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,870
government will decide but probably the

555
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:24,290
next one the situation will be more a

556
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:26,629
little bit quiet more not so turbulence

557
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,730
yeah i think we would be in brussels

558
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:31,520
surprised that it would come from or

559
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,810
czech republic or hungry very soon we

560
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,629
would all be extremely surprised that

561
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:38,450
would be kind of a vote of confidence in

562
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:41,390
the EU and in the euro of course but

563
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:43,130
anyhow what I often hear and if there is

564
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,710
nobody who has a bet on who will be the

565
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,990
next member i go on nobody has a bet at

566
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,000
this stage no one has a question nobody

567
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,160
dares to say look i think it will be

568
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,380
that country no

569
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,170
what I hear often in brussels by the way

570
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,970
is that I mean one of the reasons of

571
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,680
attractiveness for the eurozone is a

572
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:04,490
technical reason it's for the financial

573
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,260
system the banking system say if your

574
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,420
members of the eurozone your part of

575
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,610
let's say this big ECB machinery and

576
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:15,650
your bank's could get this liquidity

577
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:17,419
from the ECB which disadvantages which I

578
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,770
often hear from for example one of the

579
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:20,000
members of my board is the new de

580
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:22,129
huebner a member of the European

581
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,200
Parliament a former state secretary for

582
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,390
Poland and a former commissioner he said

583
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,000
all financial system is disadvantage as

584
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,790
compared to those within the eurozone

585
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,370
because of these big liquidity providing

586
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,930
operations of the ECB the low interest

587
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,209
rates and so on so that's what I would

588
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,440
ask to mr. let's say whether what what

589
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,810
do you think is this something which you

590
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,580
see from Slovenia's perspective is this

591
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,360
an advantage for the slovenian financial

592
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,919
market is compared to your neighbors I

593
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,810
wish I could speak for slovenia as well

594
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,710
i would prefer to speak so for slovakia

595
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:56,000
sorry so thank you yes I meant survey k

596
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,820
of course they were the first in the

597
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,700
club so you remember that okay no I mean

598
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:05,210
it's so far I have been quite skeptical

599
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:08,300
but I you I would be very unhappy if I

600
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:10,850
left the panel without saying some nice

601
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,560
words about what is happening in the

602
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,080
eurozone and definitely there has been a

603
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,570
lot of work done in the banking Union

604
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:21,500
area in the physical surveillance area

605
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:23,300
in the financial Union and and we need

606
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,350
to keep on doing the homeworks in

607
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:31,220
structural and fiscal areas but so far

608
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:33,290
what we haven't been having is sort of a

609
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,360
longer-term vision and I'm for this

610
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:37,850
reason I'm very happy that five

611
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,760
president with five presidents report is

612
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,459
there also it mentions it's not reaching

613
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,520
text not rich in detail and it's a for

614
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,730
longer term also the the idea of further

615
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:52,370
integration in the in the fiscal area we

616
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:54,400
are quite happy about it and I believe

617
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:59,139
like coming back to the discussion

618
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:02,029
before if ever the eurozone is to become

619
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:04,700
that

620
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:08,090
haven of economic stability I believe

621
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,489
that will need to create stabilization

622
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:13,009
instruments on the central level to deal

623
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:17,179
with symmetric and asymmetric shocks as

624
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:18,889
well right now we had just a few minutes

625
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:21,469
ago we had a discussion on the European

626
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:24,340
unemployment insurance scheme which

627
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:29,629
could be the mechanism to deal with a

628
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:32,869
symmetric shocks there sorry I also i

629
00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:36,228
thought was scott also for the

630
00:28:32,869 --> 00:28:39,769
situations when symmetric shocks cannot

631
00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:42,919
be effectively dealt with by by the ECB

632
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:45,710
especially when it's on its zero lower

633
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,719
bound the monetary policy is on zero

634
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:49,570
lower bound I think that the common

635
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:51,589
investment program could could work and

636
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:54,979
we're also quite happy that we have

637
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:57,440
already something in the making it's the

638
00:28:54,979 --> 00:29:00,710
EFS I European fund for strategic

639
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,229
investments which we believe is a very

640
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,479
good start and if it can extend its

641
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:07,729
scope of activities and become truly

642
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:09,950
macro economically significant that

643
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:12,469
would help the stability of the euro

644
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:15,349
this is the young career plan yes yes it

645
00:29:12,469 --> 00:29:17,869
is say of course it's used mostly as the

646
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:20,859
abbreviation EFS I but I think most

647
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:23,089
people know it as the younger plan has

648
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:26,509
slovak i already put forward proposals

649
00:29:23,089 --> 00:29:28,940
for this yes yes we committed I think we

650
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:31,210
were now talking about rankings we are

651
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,260
the seventh in the

652
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:38,559
in in line to announce contribution of

653
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:40,419
400 million not to the central level no

654
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,879
country to my to my knowledge has

655
00:29:40,419 --> 00:29:44,890
contributed to the central level to the

656
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,169
level of fun but on the on the level of

657
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:50,649
national origin of platforms here using

658
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:53,080
our development banks and and vehicles

659
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:55,059
we we committed quite a significant

660
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,620
portion of cannibal come back to one

661
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,360
thing because one of my next question

662
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,549
was about this five presidents report

663
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,260
which of course is eurozone issue or

664
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:04,120
mostly eurozone issue which may be part

665
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,020
of this new implicit criteria which you

666
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,100
mentioned mr. Palach but I went meant to

667
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,950
ask you to your Minister this morning

668
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,360
what is fiscal union meaning if I look

669
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,899
at the five presidents report I see

670
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:21,039
there Luke we want to have what is it

671
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:23,709
Treasury a euro treasury by 2027 or 2024

672
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,899
i know i think it's 2027 so about 10

673
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:29,640
years 12 years from now but what is

674
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:32,889
fiscal union have you got a definition

675
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,309
first of all i will go back a bit what

676
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:38,380
you hello i was going to ask first mr.

677
00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:41,529
sol SI ok there are there are many

678
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:43,419
definitions and i would mention the two

679
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:48,130
definitions that are really probably the

680
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:50,049
most often used for one for once fiscal

681
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:51,760
union is the union of fiscal rules

682
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:54,730
that's basically something that we are

683
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,760
already having and that's that's that's

684
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:01,270
the union of rules of surveillance of

685
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,309
informants enforcement of rules then the

686
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:05,260
full-fledged fiscal union would be

687
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:07,690
something with a central budget with

688
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,629
central democratic authority or

689
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,090
overseeing these and then there are

690
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:15,640
there's a spectrum in between for

691
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:17,320
example we are we are not naive to argue

692
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,809
that we want a fiscal Union very soon

693
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,090
but as I said some instruments that are

694
00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:24,908
not really under political control and

695
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:28,299
that can be set up or designed in a way

696
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:32,440
that they are really working with some

697
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:35,908
kind of indicators like for example with

698
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,260
the investment fund there can be a

699
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,929
investment gap or output gap as an

700
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,039
indicator of how it should work or

701
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:43,630
European unemployment insurance scheme

702
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,850
that's let's pretty all stabilizers

703
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,740
that's what you want to hide

704
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:49,300
like I think mr. gas meter mentioned

705
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:51,610
this morning let take things which

706
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,800
contrasts cyclical stabilizers like this

707
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,899
unemployment insurance schemes or like

708
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,330
absolutely absolutely that's that's what

709
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:02,380
we have in mind ok so we turn back to

710
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:04,030
the non-eurozone yeah I just would like

711
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,240
to come back to one point which you have

712
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:11,280
asked whether the ECB has helped a lot

713
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:15,730
and project as well yes and I think that

714
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:18,280
were we inside would have been more

715
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,380
advantageous or not there were certain

716
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,440
price parts of the crisis when yes

717
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,330
definitely that would have been

718
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,880
advantages in the turn of two thousand

719
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:31,899
eight and nine that that was a liquidity

720
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:35,320
dry up if we remember then the very soon

721
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:39,280
the ECB has started to use different

722
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:42,669
tools to help to counteract against this

723
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,740
liquidity dry but that meant at least in

724
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,200
Hungary and I think in other Central and

725
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,480
Eastern European countries where

726
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,660
subsidiaries of Western banks was there

727
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:56,440
that suddenly remaining liquidity in

728
00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:00,160
Hungary was just swept to back to the

729
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,870
eurozone which even deteriorated the

730
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,240
situation in hungary from the liquidity

731
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:06,429
point of view and I think that hungry

732
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,310
was not the only country here that that

733
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,170
was an unintended consequence positive

734
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:13,750
from the eurozone point of view but

735
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:17,140
negative from the outsiders point of

736
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:20,440
view in that sense if we were in or the

737
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:23,290
ECB at that time would have been ready

738
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,720
to consider these unintended

739
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,250
consequences and react also for the non

740
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,820
eurozone countries that would have been

741
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:34,530
very helpful the second point if I take

742
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:38,230
the last five years of economic policy I

743
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:42,340
think that the O'Donnell autonomy of the

744
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:46,390
monetary policy in my country definitely

745
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:51,669
could have a larger much of Minerva to

746
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:54,490
adjust to to react on the consequences

747
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,370
of the crisis and really to improve the

748
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,450
economic structure to growth figures and

749
00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:01,629
so on going

750
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:03,550
down almost as much as the ECB we have

751
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:07,990
now at one point three percent one point

752
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:10,570
thirty five percent the central rate so

753
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:13,239
the general interest is also very row

754
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,490
but the autonomy of the of the monetary

755
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:18,520
policy was extremely helpful in this

756
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:21,850
last five year and we would have had

757
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:24,219
much less magic maneuver being part of

758
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:26,739
the eurozone frankly speaking so in this

759
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:29,980
very specific circumstances in the last

760
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:32,319
five years I think that the and I think

761
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,760
it's not only our opinion the IMF just a

762
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,940
few months ago issued a working paper

763
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,070
which might be known for some people

764
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,280
which was about the six new member

765
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:47,740
states experience and here this whole

766
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,650
phenomenon veteran autonomous monetary

767
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:53,290
policy is more useful given the crisis

768
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:55,240
situation seemingly there are lots of

769
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,970
proof that that proved to be more useful

770
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,160
in our case so you would say more

771
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,770
advantages the last five to six seven

772
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,839
years to be outside and we enjoy it with

773
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:08,430
the exception of some elements which you

774
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:08,430
might go short term entender

775
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,450
you
