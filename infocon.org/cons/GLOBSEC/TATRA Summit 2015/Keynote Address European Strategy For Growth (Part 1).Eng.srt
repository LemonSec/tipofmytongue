1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,969
dear ladies and gentlemen honored guests

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,759
it is my great pleasure to have the

3
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:21,180
opportunity to introduce the president

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,230
of the european investment bank mr. van

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:30,210
de hire enough braces have been set on

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:33,930
the EIB and the president and these

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,440
prices were well deserved vib has been

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,040
investing in Europe for more than 50

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,110
years and by volume it's the biggest

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:49,289
multilateral lander mr. who firmly leads

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,219
this institution even though that times

12
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:56,699
are challenging and it is exactly these

13
00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:00,239
challenges I would like to highlight the

14
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,339
challenge is the DI be and by extend mr.

15
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,970
Hoyer will be facing in the near and

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,060
distant future it is hard to say that

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,240
with the implementation of the younger

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,810
plan the bank is facing an unprecedented

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,640
task the European fund for strategic

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:23,580
investments it's not business as usual

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,210
the long-term future of the EU rests on

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,939
the ability of the FSI to deliver on its

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,509
objective and that is to close the large

24
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,960
investment gap the work doesn't have to

25
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,380
stop there the FSI has a strong

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,860
potential to become what Europe is

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,259
liking and that is an instrument for

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:49,079
macroeconomic stabilization making the

29
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,049
FSI deliver is not an easy task to

30
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:56,039
handle but judging by the pace with

31
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,710
which the eib has been implementing the

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,810
FSI from setting up the necessary

33
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:03,929
processes to the pre-selection of

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,500
project i am happy to say we are in good

35
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,530
hands and with this thought I'm pleased

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,540

00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:40,349
impressive conference and talk about

44
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:45,250
Europe's response to the investment

45
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:47,319
crisis this summit which takes place for

46
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,569
the fourth time has really become an

47
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,179
established platform to discuss the most

48
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:56,048
urgent political financial and economic

49
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,609
issues this year this year's event is

50
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:00,939
putting key emphasis on the assessment

51
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:03,189
of the used strategic agenda and its

52
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:06,608
implementation and this is just one year

53
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:08,950
after the well life began in you in

54
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:12,189
Brussels because we had an impressive

55
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:15,638
and different campaign for the european

56
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:19,150
parliament election and an unusual

57
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:23,199
procedure to get a new commission into

58
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,639
place and now one year is gone the

59
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,379
debate will focus primarily on

60
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,989
fundamental pillars of this agenda the

61
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:31,560
energy union the single digital market

62
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,540
the genuine economic and monetary union

63
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,069
the capital market union and the

64
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,400
investment plan for Europe but this

65
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:41,290
summit will also not fade out the

66
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,099
multiple challenges Europe is facing a

67
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,620
various fronts security crisis the

68
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,629
British of random and first and foremost

69
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,540
the migration and refugee crisis which

70
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,250
is which all took my belief will have a

71
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,948
great impact on the future of European

72
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,949
integration I say this in particular

73
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:02,650
with reference to the refugees crisis

74
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,659
where we see day in day out pictures of

75
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,639
refugees some of whom risks of their

76
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:08,858
lives and dramatic circumstances in

77
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,500
order to make their way to Europe but we

78
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,819
also see pictures of scenes showing how

79
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,329
people in Europe are reacting to this

80
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:19,599
challenge a challenge that many period

81
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:23,490
people perceive as a threat but which

82
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:26,409
also can be seen as a great opportunity

83
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,160
at the moment many questions arise

84
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:29,260
questions

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,370
which are present no answers is yet but

86
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:36,610
which urgently need to be answered and I

87
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,250
am sure that in this context and this is

88
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,110
still a little bit underestimated the

89
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,910
financial dimension will reach the

90
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,780
tables of the finance ministers very

91
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:49,630
very soon so we better prepare for that

92
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,119
in many cases this is already the case

93
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,560
but others seem to need more time in

94
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,870
order to recognize how deep the

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,610
challenge is going to be even this has

96
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,080
been already been said so often that it

97
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,400
has become common knowledge the fact

98
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,289
remains that we must first of all

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,479
eliminate or at least mitigate the

100
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,250
causes of migration in the countries of

101
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,760
origin and I know that this will take

102
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:16,390
more time but we must begin now wherever

103
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,740
possible people must get back hope and a

104
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,210
reliable perspective that the living

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,740
conditions will improve that there is an

106
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,169
economic perspectives in particular for

107
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,520
young people worse ensure that people in

108
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,380
their own interest feeling able to

109
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,930
pursue their way to prosperity and

110
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,900
freedom in their home countries in doing

111
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,650
so I believe that we must also

112
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:37,900
reconsider some fundamental pillars of

113
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,840
development policies I think it's time

114
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,000
for a paradigm change in development

115
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,369
policy needs to be pursued there but in

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,360
the activity is strong strategically

117
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,890
based or activity that is scared at

118
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:55,720
producing economic perspectives growth

119
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:59,020
innovation and jobs and in this case it

120
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,780
is true what we see in other context and

121
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,719
I will come back to this today again

122
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,760
it's quite obvious that however your

123
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,640
ring out public budgets on the national

124
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,330
on the International European level

125
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,919
public funds will never be enough to pay

126
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,349
for the challenges that will have to

127
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:19,810
cope with in the next year's also in the

128
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,610
question of migration but also the

129
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,010
question of climate change all's in the

130
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,380
question of the attainment of the

131
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,710
sustainable development goals to which

132
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:33,520
we just described a few weeks ago in in

133
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,080
New York we must also strengthen the

134
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,340
transit stage especially turkey in the

135
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,820
Western Balkan countries for example

136
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,780
within the Western Balkans conference in

137
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,599
the

138
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,179
with reverse important conference and

139
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,100
the European Youth Employment initiative

140
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,630
we have two instruments that can be

141
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,090
effectively combined in the Balkan

142
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,950
states I remember vividly the Western

143
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,000
Balkan summits roughly eight weeks ago

144
00:06:53,950 --> 00:07:01,030
in Vienna when Chancellor Merkel

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,940
reminded herself and us that two years

146
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,289
ago when she started the Western Balkan

147
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,389
initiatives then called Boland

148
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:10,180
initiative at the same time she started

149
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,860
the youth unemployment initiative

150
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,080
together with president along did a few

151
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,890
others and by now we have made

152
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,430
experiences with that last year long eib

153
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,770
invested 14 billion euros in loans to

154
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,900
SMEs and mid-caps and into vocational

155
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,940
training facilities and similar

156
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:32,590
institutions in order to produce

157
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,419
perspectives for young people and this

158
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,919
is an instrument that could not be

159
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,169
married with the Western Balkan

160
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,880
initiative by offering similar

161
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,490
activities to the Western Balkan

162
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,310
countries as well whose leaders very

163
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,660
clearly said what is needed because one

164
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,630
of them put it in a picture and said

165
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,240
well I have the problem that my people

166
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,430
my young people without orientation have

167
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,760
three choices either be a resilient

168
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,280
seated out and wait for better times

169
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,250
takes a lot of patience the others are

170
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,559
tried to move north immediately to this

171
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:10,180
country to Austria to Hungary to freedom

172
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:13,390
to Germany in the third group he says is

173
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:15,880
turning to the Islamic state so there is

174
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,710
even a security and strategic dimension

175
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,940
in this question so we have to give more

176
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,150
attention to the situation in the

177
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:27,190
Western Balkans and we try to be helpful

178
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:28,390
there the situation varies currently

179
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,340
driving young people who have no

180
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,348
prospect of finding work either north to

181
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,299
Sweden Germany Austria and Luxembourg

182
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,630
for instance or it is driving them south

183
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,530
into the Islamic state and here only

184
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:42,099
determined action against the lack of

185
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,449
prospects will help and thirdly we must

186
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:45,130
overcome the challenges within the

187
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,080
European Union the first thing is the

188
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,850
countries of arrival and let's be honest

189
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,470
we have had a blind eye for too long on

190
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,320
the situation on the southern shores of

191
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:54,100
the European Union there we must create

192
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,810
an infrastructure

193
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,370
that is fit for human beings and can

194
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,709
cope with a humanitarian as well as

195
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,990
administrative tasks but the same

196
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:04,779
applies to realize what the job of

197
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,610
successfully integrating people who are

198
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:10,029
able to stay in those countries actually

199
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:12,699
implies for us the eib has approached

200
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:14,380
the eco-friendly finance ministers

201
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:17,199
council eight weeks ago on this issue

202
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,959
and will continue to make offers how we

203
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:23,740
believe we contribute to at least help

204
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:30,959
on the financial side of mitigating this

205
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:30,959
huge problem ladies and gentlemen the

206
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:37,420
Tetra summit is taking on also this

207
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:40,779
challenge and I welcome this very much

208
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,160
because I'm fairly sure that we will

209
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:44,620
never be able to cope with that

210
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,779
challenge without arriving at a European

211
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:53,079
solidarity based solution ladies and

212
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:55,509
gentlemen let me tend out turn to the

213
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,579
agenda point where i'm proud to kick off

214
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:59,829
the discussion europe's response to the

215
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:02,410
investment and innovation crisis i miss

216
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:05,469
admit that the organizers of the Tetra

217
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:07,719
summit last year had a very good hand

218
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,370
the main aim of the conference was to

219
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,680
address europe strategic growth a good

220
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,589
gender a challenge was which has not

221
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,329
lost in relevance the fact is that for

222
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,970
decades we have been living off our

223
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:20,769
capital the result is an enormous

224
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,740
investment backlog and need for

225
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:25,439
modernization since the beginning of the

226
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,480
financial and economic crisis a

227
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:29,769
pronounced lack of investment has led to

228
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,610
a further reduction in productivity

229
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:36,189
growth which was in any case already low

230
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:39,120
in all major sectors of the economy to

231
00:10:36,189 --> 00:10:41,439
put this into figures last year in

232
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,209
preparation for the incoming new

233
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:49,870
commission we made a series of studies

234
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:51,279
addressing these issues because we

235
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,290
wanted to know how big the gap is

236
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,420
between what is really needed and it

237
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,000
what is out what's actually planned in

238
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,569
terms of investment in Europe let me

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,309
just by a few figures illustrate how

240
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:06,339
dramatically we in Europe are lagging

241
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:07,510
behind total investment is Europe Europe

242
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:09,520
is still currently

243
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,730
about fifteen percent under the level of

244
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:15,579
2007 it was not a surprise that in 2007

245
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:19,450
it dropped surprises that it said low

246
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:22,000
for so long now compared with the 2007

247
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,890
peak and I take out the bubble for

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,110
instance in in in real estate in Spain

249
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,280
before 2007 that of course contributed

250
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,460
to this high figure but there's only

251
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,410
very small part of the explanation but

252
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,400
compared with the 2007 peak the volume

253
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,900
of investment has followed by

254
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,959
approximately four hundred and thirty

255
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,930
billion euros in absolute terms and at

256
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,030
nineteen point three percent of GDP is

257
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:46,449
around two percent below the long-term

258
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:50,050
average of a little bit above twenty one

259
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:51,880
percent investment to GDP in the field

260
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,420
of energy and energy efficiency alone an

261
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,580
extra 100 billion euros or so per year

262
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,430
would be needed on top of what is

263
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,260
already envisaged and to fill the gaps

264
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,750
that still exists in Europe's transport

265
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,210
infrastructure another 50 billion or so

266
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,730
a year would be required this would

267
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,890
include investment in expanding

268
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:16,600
intermodal transport and environmentally

269
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:19,240
sustainable mobility in urban areas the

270
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,610
urgency the urgently needed expansion of

271
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,550
broadband networks and maybe even more

272
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,890
important of data centers the amount

273
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:30,189
required comes to 55 billion euros a

274
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,770
year and one issue that people tend to

275
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,650
neglect or overlooked to upgrade

276
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,790
Europe's water and sanitation systems

277
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,860
including flood protection to meet

278
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,770
demand it is estimated that a good

279
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,680
additional 90 billion euros a year will

280
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,329
be needed if you add this all up you end

281
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,329
up at the figure of more than 500

282
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,940
billion euros per year and the point of

283
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:56,500
reference for all this is not some dream

284
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:59,590
of environmentalists or people who love

285
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,870
trains or people who are just becoming

286
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,840
aware of the quality of the water pipes

287
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,000
in our countries the benchmark is the

288
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,110
decisions of the European Council the

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:14,170
target set by the European Council for

290
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:17,530
2016 or for 2020 respectively so it is

291
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,630
what we have agreed to pursue and not

292
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,800
something that we now begin to dream

293
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,510
about

294
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,889
to make things worse this investment gap

295
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,149
is complemented by an increasing

296
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,980
innovation gap that makes Europe's

297
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:32,139
position the globalised world even more

298
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,730
challenging it just two percent of GDP

299
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,589
expenditure on research in the EU is not

300
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,079
only one percent below the three percent

301
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:41,329
target laid down in the Lisbon agenda

302
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:43,910
but also more than one percentage point

303
00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:48,199
below the levels achieved by other

304
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:50,600
competitors and if you take the top crop

305
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:54,019
of them the United States South Korea

306
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,519
Japan we can save that only for one and

307
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:57,620
a half decades we are trailing by one

308
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,079
point five to one point eight percent of

309
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,190
GDP behind their expenditures on the

310
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,839
knowledge economy in general if the you

311
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,699
wanted to achieve with three percent of

312
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,949
GDP target for research and development

313
00:14:07,699 --> 00:14:12,680
which by international standard is by no

314
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:14,750
means excessively ambitious we would

315
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:19,399
have to invest another 130 billion a

316
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:21,620
year so I'm convinced that we have a

317
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,829
specific problem in the field of

318
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,269
digitalization Europe's strengthen the

319
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:27,949
future where we determined first and

320
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:29,269
foremost by our ability to make up for

321
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:32,120
lost ground in terms of digital

322
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:33,980
technologies and services but even when

323
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,630
sure to say that the lack of

324
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,750
competitiveness in many parts of Europe

325
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,939
has also been caused and then reinforced

326
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,560
by the fact that in the past we have

327
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,190
invested far too little in this field of

328
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,599
course structural weaknesses in Europe

329
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,880
play a crucial role in explaining the

330
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,070
low growth but lack of investment in

331
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,399
this highly competitive sector is also a

332
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:58,730
significant factor also he just a few

333
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,890
figures the data traffic within the EU

334
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,829
on for communication for the internet

335
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:08,329
for video has increased by the factor of

336
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:09,680
five since 2008 if we fail to make the

337
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:11,420
appropriate digital infrastructure

338
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,219
available to accommodate this rapid

339
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,050
growth we shall continue to fall even

340
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,860
further behind in terms of global

341
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,240
competition we must realize that in

342
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,120
addition to the issue of training and

343
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,589
human creativity the data issue will be

344
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,769
the key factor in the future to

345
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,880
successfully withstanding competition in

346
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:31,310
the field of digital infrastructure

347
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,260
alone we must invest 30 billion a year

348
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,930
more that we are currently investing and

349
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,520
this

350
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,589
includes not include yet the

351
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,840
consequences to be drawn of the ruling

352
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:44,410
of the European Court of Justice on the

353
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:48,850
question of digital safety digital

354
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:50,620
security and because there we will see

355
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,450
that another major challenge facing

356
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:54,730
Europe is the fact that it does not have

357
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:58,060
the necessary data center cape capacity

358
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,710
we are constantly reminded of this in

359
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,459
directive and data protection incidents

360
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:05,080
if I might call them that occur

361
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,970
ultimately they take place maybe outside

362
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,400
Europe and make it impossible for us

363
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,140
Europeans to exert any influence because

364
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,980
we ourselves are not in a position to

365
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,900
make appropriate capacity available

366
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:19,840
that's another 25 billion euros

367
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:23,140
incidentally here is not only a matter

368
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,880
of investment but also of creating the

369
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,439
necessary framework to complete the

370
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,990
digital internal market it's a little

371
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,220
bit absurd there is probably no sector

372
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:36,790
in the world which is by its nature more

373
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:39,730
transnational than the digital world but

374
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,380
when it comes to the reality in Europe

375
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,910
we find out we are far away from that

376
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,380
just think that only four percent of

377
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,260
digital services are of a cross-border

378
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,850
nature four percent in area where like

379
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,189
few others national borders can easily

380
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,960
be overcome provided that this is

381
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,910
accompanied by an appropriate regulatory

382
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,130
framework which we do not have because

383
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,500
we had 28 of them or the United States

384
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:06,189
of America is one and you're India has

385
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,380
one and the China has one so this is key

386
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:13,750
obstacle to Arkham return to

387
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:16,030
competitiveness excuse me ladies and

388
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,740
gentlemen my aim of enumerated all these

389
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:20,020
figures is not to draw a pessimistic

390
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,849
image of the future of our continent but

391
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,800
to draw attention to this development

392
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:25,869
and to show you some means of how this

393
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,260
development can be turned around leading

394
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:31,750
to a more optimistic scenario after all

395
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,520
these figures one effect this event is

396
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,710
if evident this huge investment

397
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,160
requirement cannot be met with public

398
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,170
funds alone when I met jean-claude

399
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,910
Juncker in the spring of 2014 when he

400
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,190
prepared for his bid for the presidency

401
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,910
of the European Commission he was

402
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,770
preparing his program

403
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,770
which would present to the European

404
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:54,620
Parliament but I told him what I've told

405
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,820
you today basically these figures were

406
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,929
just produce or found out at that time

407
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,370
he asked what needed to be done to get

408
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,590
other vicious circle of low investment

409
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,350
slow growth high public expenditures in

410
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,620
what role the EU bank could play in this

411
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:12,379
respect well we all know that eib is not

412
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,790
the panacea and shouldn't try to be and

413
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,100
the abbey activities cannot substitute

414
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,570
the fundamental precondition of having

415
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,459
the Member States implementer reforms

416
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,939
for achieving an investment friendly

417
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,740
regulatory framework but the Ewbank can

418
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:26,990
support economic development within this

419
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,640
framework and can identify barriers to

420
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,810
investment and we are trying to help

421
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,790
vice president of the Commission

422
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,379
Timmerman's on this crucial challenge

423
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:37,280
the Commission will have to meet in the

424
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:38,690
next year's we do this by also by

425
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,430
mobilizing private capital on a large

426
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,720
scale to in order to invest into good

427
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:45,440
and viable projects in the real economy

428
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,600
because the EU bank is the crowding in

429
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,190
bank that's our job we are sometimes

430
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
accused of crowding out the private

431
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:53,150
sector and whenever I hear that I go

432
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,340
after it and try to to remove the

433
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,560
problem because public bank is not there

434
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:00,860
to crowd out other banks public bank is

435
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,330
there to go into gaps which the market

436
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,399
doesn't fill because they're basically

437
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,770
market failure then it's justified the

438
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,520
public bank in my conviction always must

439
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:12,740
justify its intervention what makes ya

440
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,240
bees activities so crucial is the fact

441
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,910
that we can leverage scarce public

442
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,100
resources and hence maximize their

443
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,620
effect by blending them with private

444
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,020
capital and focus on loans which means

445
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,280
that we as a year as a bank actually

446
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,740
would like one day these loans will be

447
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,149
paid back this is why an experience

448
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,520
which really knocked me off when I came

449
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,150
to this Bank four years ago I had to

450
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,430
explain rail ministers even members of

451
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:41,450
the European Council that we are not a

452
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:44,450
grant organization we are a bank we lend

453
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,270
money and believe it or not we want to

454
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,670
have it back with interest so it's a

455
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,340
different model than being a development

456
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,680
agency I mean this is sometimes very

457
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,850
relevant when we do our business outside

458
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,100
the European Union because they're

459
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,500
sometimes the exit communication is we

460
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,179
come over them to programs

461
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:08,510
out of our huge pockets no no it's the

462
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:11,810
basic idea is to provide loans to be

463
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:14,150
paid back and the headline is lending

464
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,270
which is not unusual for the bank for a

465
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:21,650
bank blending that is the better use of

466
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:24,020
EU funds and advising that is closing

467
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:28,460
the gap like sometimes exists between

468
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:30,200
ambition and capabilities we have a

469
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,880
catalytic role through mobilizing

470
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,530
private cattle but this is not enough as

471
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,480
there is abundant liquidity on the

472
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,490
market anyway I mean the situation when

473
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,960
yeah we went to its shoulders four years

474
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,030
ago and asked for a couple increase was

475
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,250
completely different today liquidity is

476
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,250
not the problem Europe is drowning in

477
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,210
liquidity but what is needed is an

478
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:53,120
increased risk taking capacity of those

479
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:58,430
who must produce the projects that will

480
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:02,060
bring our economies forward it is about

481
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,770
mobilizing capital in order to invest

482
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:06,080
into projects that require an appetite

483
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,639
for taking risk that currently many

484
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,560
private investors do not seem to bring

485
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,210
along and this is not a criticism this

486
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:16,760
is a just a statement of facts because

487
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:19,010
what do we expect for instance when we

488
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,450
clean up the banking system which we

489
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,800
have done which the finance ministers

490
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:24,250
and the European Parliament in the other

491
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,620
they have done in the last year's

492
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:32,180
successful in my view but that also

493
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:34,639
meant to reduce the manoeuvre space of

494
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,860
the banks to come up with new loans and

495
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,050
this is produced problems in many areas

496
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,540
we do not have these problems only in

497
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,399
crisis countries take for instance the

498
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,460
effects of the banking regulation on the

499
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,380
SME loan activities in the Netherlands

500
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,450
one of the richest countries of the

501
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,520
European Union in the Netherlands you

502
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:55,490
have serious problem in getting alone as

503
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:58,460
an SME and therefore there is also a

504
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,260
challenge for us so when we talk about

505
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,530
crowding in private investors for

506
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,060
investments in Europe that due to market

507
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,840
failure will not take place with the

508
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:11,629
support of a public bank then it means

509
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,699
that we have to address the question of

510
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,390
risk and going on to risk is nothing new

511
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,140
for you

512
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:19,580
be risk-taking is an inherent part of a

513
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,290
bank's activity and we have started to

514
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,149
increase our risk taking capacity 15

515
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,129
years ago when introducing the bucket of

516
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:29,900
the so-called special activities at that

517
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:31,550
time there was 250 million euros this

518
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,010
amount has increased in recent years to

519
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:38,090
over five billion euros per annum and

520
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:40,310
will with the support of the FSI the

521
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,459
younger plan will reach some 20 billion

522
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:45,889
euros in the next year's this is the

523
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,580
basic difference the ability of the EU

524
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:51,620
public bank to increase its activities

525
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,159
in on the higher end of the risks scale

526
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,629
and since then we have introduced

527
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,970
several new blending instruments for

528
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,820
certain sectors but as a bee is not

529
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:07,310
lending taxpayers money but needs to

530
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:08,960
collect every single cent we lend by

531
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,850
collecting private capital from the

532
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,350
financial markets worldwide almost fifty

533
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,719
percent by the way from non-european

534
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:16,100
sources the writing of the bank is of

535
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,870
fundamental importance making the

536
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:21,800
ability to increase the risk taking

537
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:23,540
limited in quantitative terms the

538
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,820
volumes we are talking about are between

539
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,409
60 and 90 billion euros per year which

540
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,510
we need to borrow on the international

541
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,250
capital markets and that requires the

542
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,550
confidence in the trust of the investors

543
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:37,190
and the investors will fade away quickly

544
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:40,190
as soon as we produce the impression

545
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,780
that we support projects which are not

546
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,720
sound economically viable and

547
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,370
sustainable so this is the the tension

548
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,830
you always live in between being a

549
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:50,620
public institution based on the treaty

550
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,030
of rome or nowadays the Treaty of Lisbon

551
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,919
but on the other hand you're extremely

552
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,530
market and competition oriented because

553
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,970
you have to stand the competition with

554
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,800
other people who would like to get these

555
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:05,420
60 to 90 billion from the investors on

556
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:07,399
the international markets this is the

557
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,350
point to a rock Lanka and myself agreed

558
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,050
to enable eib to take risks on a much

559
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,909
larger scale and if you want this was

560
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:17,060
the birth of the investment plan for

561
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:21,230
Europe or better known as the the young

562
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:22,550
Kaplan and from the start jean-claude

563
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,710
juncker brightly put the lack of

564
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,240
investment and decreasing

565
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,740
competitiveness of the European unit on

566
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,300
the top of his political agenda

567
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,260
for the new commission term with the

568
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,360
investment plan for Europe we now have

569
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,200
an instrument in place to address these

570
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,580
issues and this is not limited to FC to

571
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,830
the European front for strategic

572
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:47,470
investment it's the best known part of

573
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:50,000
it which by the way despite its name

574
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,890
it's nothing else than a managed account

575
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,460
inside the bank backed by a 16 billion

576
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:57,830
euro guarantee of the EU budget and five

577
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,630
billion in cash from EA be in order to

578
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,020
increase the risk taking capacity of the

579
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:06,890
bank as just described so sometimes I

580
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:09,530
need to tell investors fund managers and

581
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:12,230
others need to disappoint you first

582
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,510
because the fund is not a fund and the

583
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,429
European Council in December 2015

584
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,290
explicitly changed the conclusions of

585
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:21,140
the European Council by making clear

586
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:23,240
that it is to be to be an integral part

587
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:27,650
of the EU bank and not a separate new

588
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,850
bureaucracy in Brussels what is new with

589
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,250
the investment plan for Europe is the

590
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:34,639
fact that now we can take more is on a

591
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:36,410
broader and larger scale furthermore the

592
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,830
provision of an EU budgetary guarantee

593
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,900
for this purpose remains represents and

594
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,300
that is my view the most important thing

595
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,590
in the medium and long term of the

596
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,470
development of the European integration

597
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:52,699
process the fundamental paradigm change

598
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:55,700
in the use of EU public funds away from

599
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,309
grants and subsidies in favor of loans

600
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,110
and guarantees now you can say we are

601
00:25:58,309 --> 00:26:03,260
talking about 21 billion as a guarantee

602
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,600
buffer out of a and 16 of them out of

603
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:07,550
the EU budget for a period of seven

604
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,129
years where the EU budget is more than

605
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:12,050
1,000 billion euros but still it is a

606
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,320
very important first step away from

607
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:19,370
these subsidies thinking in Europe and

608
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:22,850
towards a more mobilizing activity

609
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:27,439
thinking via grants biovar guarantees

610
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:31,159
and loans I believe that every economic

611
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:35,059
experience shows that somebody who is

612
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:39,110
given a loan with expectation of paying

613
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:40,840
it back probably has a wiser idea for

614
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,080
the use of that money then if

615
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,459
he or she just gets a lost grant

616
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,220
although I see there are institutions

617
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,559
which depend upon grants so we have to

618
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,200
be very careful part of the money coming

619
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,629
from the EU budget comes from horizon

620
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,299
2020 this is in many cases very very

621
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:01,179
important research money that will need

622
00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:02,830
also in the future so the trick for the

623
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:05,940
people in the commissioner and the

624
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:09,279
Parliament will be to get these

625
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:12,220
relatively limited front of 2.7 billion

626
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,890
euros out of pockets of the research

627
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,789
budget of 80 billion for seven years

628
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,789
where they do
