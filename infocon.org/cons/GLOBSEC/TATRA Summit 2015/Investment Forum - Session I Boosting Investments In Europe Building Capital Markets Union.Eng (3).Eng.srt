conditions and the markets in ljubljana

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,030
in Prague in Budapest so that's why we

38
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,570
can also touch the regional issues and

39
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,710
last but not least we have Carson killer

40

who is coming from the European Council

41
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,339
for many of you does the building where

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,469
you can see all this Prime Minister

43
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,939
ministers meeting for the for the summit

44
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:05,669
and he is leading the he's leading the

45
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:11,129
director-general of on economic affairs

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:13,200
and competitiveness issues so capital

47
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:15,329
markets Union as it is as its then

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,619
it's something younger Commissioner

49
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,629
designed as an action plan to boost

50
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:26,010
economy and maybe help small and medium

51
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:28,170
enterprises in a way the European

52
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,720
economy as we all know it's majorly or

53
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:34,640
significantly finance from from banks or

54
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,920
by banks so the design or the aim is to

55
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,839
unlock existing capital and fresh

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,480
capital or maybe existing capital and

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,340
channel it into the real economy through

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,929
new channels so we can discuss how many

59
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,140
like what are these channels what are

60
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,760
the options what are the possibilities

61
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,470
we've heard from Iran decibel mr. day

62
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,709
that actually well-functioning an

63
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,239
effective CMU is a precondition to have

64
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:02,730
a resilient and a stronger economic

65
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,730
monetary union there are three basic

66
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,609
words they connect to the CMU they call

67
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,679
it simple transparent and standardized

68
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,480
which means harmonization this is going

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,840
to be a pain in ears for many countries

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,399
as all the issues with harmonization and

71
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,950
the deadline when they want to have all

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,150
these things in place should be 2019 so

73
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,280
let's see about that many people

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,380
complain that this is not ambitious

75
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,560
enough so maybe we'll also touch this

76
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,420
this this date as well so let's start

77
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,160
with the debate and maybe with you

78
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,828
please see you represent all the

79
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,569
businesses for many businesses what is

80
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,940
the reaction what is the either a

81
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,440
take-up is very demand so what is the

82
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:45,569
sector thinking about the whole action

83
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:48,480
plan yes this is work yeah I so first of

84
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:50,730
all thanks for the invitation and to

85
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,170
start with your question well I mean is

86
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,328
it ambitious enough I mean I think

87
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,190
overall as far as the substance and the

88
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:58,590
capital market in is concerned as a lot

89
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,239
in it of course 2019 is not the day

90
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,239
after tomorrow but I mean looking at the

91
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,849
you procedures I mean of course we would

92
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,739
like to have it earlier but overall we

93
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,899
think it's pretty ambitious do we need

94
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,880
an improvement in capital market unit I

95
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,150
mean you said it it's very clear I mean

96
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,430
we cannot have a functioning European

97
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,269
monetary union without factor mobility

98
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,280
and of course capital is is key as far

99
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,870
as this is concerned and maybe coming

100
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,400
from a more general point of view

101
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,840
talking to be

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,669
businesses to companies a lot and

103
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,919
analyzing a lot I mean why companies to

104
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,960
in Western Europe or elsewhere of course

105
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,440
there's always a mix but there's two

106
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,299
standalone reasons why companies would

107
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,550
would invest elsewhere one is cost of

108
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,650
energy and the other one depending on

109
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,949
the market you're in is access to to

110
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,810
finance so it is a real issue we are

111
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,949
very positive from the proposal of the

112
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,160
European Commission we will hear later

113
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,139
from cousin pilot of course that the

114
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,180
Devils in the detail of course this is

115
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:05,910
the beginning of a European how to say

116
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,460
of European strategy but it's not very

117
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,630
often that we are as satisfied with the

118
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,479
content of what the Commission's

119
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,830
proposing so there's a lot in it but as

120
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,260
I say this is the beginning and now it

121
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:19,349
will be about a rapid implementation of

122
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,479
many of these aspects because we have a

123
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:24,479
situation where of course the capital

124
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,539
markets in Europe fragmented they're

125
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,270
regulated differently i mean the cross

126
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:33,389
product capital flows are in many cases

127
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,979
very much hindered so what we need to do

128
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,620
now is to actually implement what the

129
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,349
european commission has proposed and

130
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,550
there's a lot of let's say encouraging

131
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:46,620
elements in it i mean first I mean this

132
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,659
unnecessary regulatory burdens which

133
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,360
hold back in westmount on infrastructure

134
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:57,180
will be reviewed this is a very

135
00:05:51,360 --> 00:06:00,240
important point for us second we think

136
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,919
that having a clear and rapid

137
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,159
improvement on the prospectus directive

138
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,080
is important especially for granting

139
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:10,199
smaller businesses better access to

140
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,460
capital markets and then of course it's

141
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:16,849
also about transparent and standardized

142
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,380
securitisation of bank loans which will

143
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:21,930
as we hope also make it easier

144
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,510
especially for smaller companies to

145
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,970
exceed violence and last but not least

146
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,490
not to be too long in the first in the

147
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,690
first steak last but not least we think

148
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,970
one of the problems we had in recent

149
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:36,960
years was of course the cumulative

150
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,430
impact of a lot of regulation I think

151
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,320
it's a very good at the air from the

152
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,410
Commission say okay let's have a look at

153
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,810
the impact let's see what is the real

154
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,360
output of these many regulations and

155
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,130
directives you have made and and let's

156
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,560
clear the SS and see what we need to

157
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,870
prepare okay a quick follow-up just a

158
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,010
quick quick question and quick answer do

159
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,420
you believe is going to make a

160
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,300
difference because okay it's a nice

161
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,860
plane we had many action plans before is

162
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,480
this going to make a difference the

163
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,510
companies because it also related with

164
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,660
literacy and maybe our companies need to

165
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,880
be keen to use that well number one of

166
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,950
course an action plan by itself doesn't

167
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,620
make a difference but the implementation

168
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,599
of the concrete actions and and as I say

169
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,880
there is the short-term thing on

170
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,010
securitization and there's a short-term

171
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,170
thing on the perspective so this is good

172
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,990
four steps but of course it will be

173
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,420
about rapid implementation but overall

174
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,340
from many things the Commission proposed

175
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,440
recently I would say this is one of the

176
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,330
things which definitely go very much in

177
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,000
the right direction ok so we touched it

178
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,099
with mr. pilot and you know the Brussels

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,190
animal quite well so what is your take

180
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,900
house how fast can we proceed well

181
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:50,940
what's going to be the biggest hard roll

182
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,229
and maybe thanks a lot first them for

183
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,120
the invitation to his excellent

184
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,610
conference here Martin this is a

185
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,900
sensitive question how fast can be

186
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,460
progress I think it's the perfect

187
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,190
because we are currently in the

188
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,349
preparation of the next echofon Council

189
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,930
the echofon council will take place next

190
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:10,530
Tuesday and on the agenda of the echofon

191
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,510
we have the capital market union i will

192
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:15,630
not bother you with the boring exercise

193
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,070
how to prepare a a coffin council but i

194
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,490
can share with you let's say some

195
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:23,490
observations one of the things is that

196
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,740
is agreed in the european in the egg of

197
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,250
in council is that they want to express

198
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,270
their common political views 28 member

199
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,580
states sitting around the table

200
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,520
expressing their views basically is a

201
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,229
very complex exercise it needs a careful

202
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:42,590
preparation and how we prepare this is

203
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:46,140
basically a simple procedure it's called

204
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:48,900
council conclusions so we have

205
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,030
committees that prepare a text the text

206
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,319
looks like this here i will not share

207
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,790
the detail there strictly confidential

208
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,810
right now

209
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:00,849
so it's it's four pages and this was

210
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,130
busy prepared by already two committees

211
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,710
the so-called financial service

212
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:07,930
committee and the EFC where state

213
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:10,270
secretaries meet they are basically the

214
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,699
deputies of ministers and they had all

215
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,819
exchange of views and in both committees

216
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,410
I would say a very awkward procedure we

217
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,480
call this written procedure where member

218
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:21,790
states express their views in written

219
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,100
and the Secretariat has then to bring

220
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:27,370
these things together so the council

221
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,650
conclusion self the four pages I do not

222
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,300
recommend to you for non-expert to read

223
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,209
this text you will never understand a

224
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,130
single word because it's very cryptical

225
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,590
how this is phrase busy and frame

226
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,200
because we need standard vocabularies

227
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,850
that are not common to everybody but I

228
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,980
give you a basically thrust of these

229
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,200
council conclusion without going into

230
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:50,350
the details and what we expect what I'm

231
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,200
saying is I speak under the proviso that

232
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,530
ministers agree on these texts and on

233
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,840
this text next Tuesday basically the

234
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,400
main thrust is among all Member States

235
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,340
what Marcos has already mentioned

236
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:08,350
basically the way forward is the right

237
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:10,900
one way forward means the capital market

238
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,400
Union in principle one has to

239
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,740
acknowledge that this is basically not a

240
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,569
new concept although the label is fine

241
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,340
we have banking Union capital market

242
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,110
Union we need even more Union I will not

243
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,660
call this migration union not in this

244
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,640
country but very somewhere else so we

245
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,740
would need more Union concept so in that

246
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,680
context fine to speak about the capital

247
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:32,830
market union but had the Commission had

248
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,069
the courage to propose the action plan

249
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:39,250
in 2016 instead of 15 they could have

250
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,050
celebrated the 50th birthday the 50th

251
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,060
birthday of these proposals because we

252
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,250
have seen so many capital market Union

253
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,459
proposes they were not labeled like this

254
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,350
in the lot in the past 50 years if you

255
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,870
would go back to 66 you would recognize

256
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,850
there were many reports realizing the

257
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,990
same obstacles which we are fighting

258
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:01,450
still today so it would not lead

259
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,340
automatically to a extrapolation

260
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,810
basically do we need another 50 years I

261
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,900
hope not to implement

262
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:10,750
but I have let's say two or three

263
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:14,380
critical remarks on this text which

264
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:16,330
basically contains the main message as i

265
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,730
said Marcos has basically outlined the

266
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,890
general thrust yes full support by

267
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,690
member states but there are also

268
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,600
concerns by member states and I would

269
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:27,820
outline three different areas where you

270
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,880
can see that we are probably at a

271
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,830
certain limit and we have probably more

272
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,650
difficulties to overcome obstacles in

273
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,750
this area the first area and you would

274
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:41,589
read this in these council conclusion is

275
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,960
tax policy member states are extremely

276
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,240
sensitive to touch upon Texas and then

277
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,029
you have to keep in mind that one of the

278
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,700
obstacles that we have have to face in a

279
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:55,630
union of 28 member states are different

280
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,750
28 different tax regimes and they all

281
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,790
impact more or less on a capital market

282
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,070
union because they have they're creating

283
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,599
obstacles for an integrated capital

284
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,760
market our member states really keen to

285
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,200
remove these obstacles i would say let's

286
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,030
see and wait there is no concrete

287
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,860
proposal here and I'd to those who are

288
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,040
familiar with text policy discussions

289
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,140
and Brussels they may look at simply the

290
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,770
discussion that's currently ongoing on

291
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,390
the FTT where only 11 out of 28 members

292
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,699
that have agreed let's say to try to

293
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,680
build a common concept and the

294
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,150
discussion is still going on it's been

295
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,310
happening for years right now with only

296
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,980
concrete results so text policy is a

297
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,599
sensitive area it's mentioned not very

298
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,520
obviously in the document but you can

299
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,010
see this from let's say in a couple of

300
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,510
paragraphs where there is sensitivities

301
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,569
member states where they do not want

302
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,610
basically touch this area another area

303
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,000
of let's say is is not that difficult

304
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,850
area a very difficult area is insolvency

305
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,680
law insolvency rules for those who are

306
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,540
familiar with that they now basically

307
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,310
that within the Union we have complete

308
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,189
different concepts a couple members that

309
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,380
are even renovating reforming their

310
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,150
insolvency rules and laws while others

311
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,250
are more or less happy with their

312
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:11,199
current system not doing much but this

313
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:14,350
is another obstacle to capital market

314
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,800
Union and the last of the three issues

315
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,300
is basically the issue of

316
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,099
assume for a moment we'll get to the

317
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,109
capital market Union do we have the

318
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,700
right supervisory structure supervise

319
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,500
the capital market unit because one of

320
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,250
the concerns expressed in the document

321
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,769
as well is the impact on stability so I

322
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,750
leave these three areas two of them have

323
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,060
a common feature it's basically a very

324
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,790
good very doubt much down to the

325
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,040
question of serenity and this would be

326
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,380
my plea to look into this further down

327
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,029
the road we are not there yet but sooner

328
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,010
or later we have to come to the question

329
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:50,260
how are we dealing with questions that

330
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,000
touch upon national sovereignty do we

331
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,649
make a full stop there and accept that

332
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,680
the capital market Union by definition

333
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,690
will be incomplete or do we think

334
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,760
basically we have to go further and what

335
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:02,470
does it mean for serenity how do we deal

336
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,480
with that what kind of approach will be

337
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,570
need in terms of taxation and in terms

338
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,880
of insolvency regime my final comment

339
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,070
basically from the perspective of the

340
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,260
council secretary or probably more or

341
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:16,930
less my personal my personal observation

342
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,899
is I'm little bit worried about a one

343
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,349
missing word in this document but I'm

344
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:25,000
secretary diamond humble a bureaucrat so

345
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,370
I'm not a politician I do not represent

346
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,120
the member state but I miss one simple

347
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:33,190
word in this document this is trust the

348
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,860
word trust does not even appear in this

349
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,620
document and that tells me that there

350
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,870
are many experts in this area working on

351
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,209
this but the real lesson of the

352
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,950
financial crisis is not really fully

353
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,619
incorporate in these documents because

354
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:51,010
it under basically it incorporates a

355
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:52,839
trust in capital markets at the moment

356
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:55,630
where we have not fully regained trust

357
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:57,550
in banks so how do we come to this

358
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,449
conclusion that basically either we

359
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:03,279
assume this by definition trust is there

360
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:05,529
I'm little worried that it's not really

361
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,240
fully incorporated how we build trust in

362
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,640
a capital market Union how we

363
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,579
communicate this to ordinary people and

364
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,010
not only to experts and this is the end

365
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:17,079
I would basically stop here and say well

366
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,600
despite my recommendation don't read

367
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,130
this councillor collision probably

368
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
better do it then you will see what I

369
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,820
mean whether when you leave these two

370
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,230
experts you will see many references to

371
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,720
regulations here and there even

372
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,180
regularly

373
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,310
numbers are incorporated the simple word

374
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,250
trust building is completely missing

375
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,739
here maybe Marcos is more right than I

376
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,600
am it's probably something more on the

377
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,120
implementation side that we build trust

378
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,579
in institution meaning even a cap of the

379
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,259
market union over time and probably

380
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:48,410
would not help to have this in the

381
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:50,509
council conclusive right now but as I

382
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,910
said the starting point then for us in

383
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:55,040
the council really to work hard even on

384
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,230
concrete details is then tuesday

385
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,629
hopefully this document is fully

386
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,689
supported by all ministers because the

387
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:05,389
rule in the council is consensus or

388
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:08,029
unanimity as far as council conclusions

389
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:11,600
is concerned political documents have a

390
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:14,240
different different majority than normal

391
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,680
ordinary legislative procedures ordinary

392
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,649
letters aid procedures only need

393
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,989
qualified majority these documents this

394
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:23,060
document needs unanimity and we are

395
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,459
hoping for unanimity on tuesday thank

396
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,449
you does i follow up you mentioned trust

397
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:29,149
how do you want to build it because

398
00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:30,410
everybody likes long Hayes Brussels they

399
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:32,569
don't believe in papers so how do you

400
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,180
build it what do you what is your

401
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:37,519
perception of trance how do you do it

402
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:40,250
and it might be one of the of the main

403
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,050
features is language in my view I've

404
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,230
talked to many many bankers in the past

405
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,000
and they were wondering about the

406
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:50,300
communication it out there I always

407
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,920
sends the same thing they bankers and

408
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,660
capital market Union specialists they

409
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,649
have very many self-referential

410
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,329
discussions among themselves and I guess

411
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,579
you're all the experts of capital market

412
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,109
unions in this room here today but let's

413
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:04,938
say if you ever talk to a group of

414
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,760
normal people and a very often deal with

415
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:09,650
visitor groups in the council I think

416
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,869
it's important that we explain why we do

417
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,669
what basically they look at me with

418
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:15,559
great eyes and you do not understand the

419
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,350
simple work because i use this brussels

420
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,089
acronyms I'm used the special wording as

421
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,369
far as the council the decision-making

422
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,589
process is concerned and they often ask

423
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:25,969
simple questions I wonder myself or I've

424
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:28,039
never thought about this carefully

425
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,780
enough to draft this carefully in the

426
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:33,020
language that people can understand and

427
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,059
in my view trust is legitimacy and trust

428
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,530
this language and we have to start on

429
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,879
this and it should start with these

430
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,620
kinds of political documents as well

431
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,070
because I find it a pity but that's my

432
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,620
personal

433
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:44,600
servation that we do these texts only in

434
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,550
a self-referential manner we hope that

435
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,560
other administrators will understand

436
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,330
what we are saying here I would like to

437
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,980
make the test with you next use they're

438
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,540
coming back and test with you what do

439
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,810
you understand from a document from a

440
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,550
text like this I'm not doubt I have no

441
00:17:56,810 --> 00:18:01,190
doubt on your intellectual capacity

442
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:03,110
don't mistreat me but I think this is

443
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,670
probably something where is huge room

444
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,310
for manoeuvre and Brussels in particular

445
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,600
to get out and to reach out with a

446
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,040
different way of language and

447
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,449
communication this will be my first

448
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,879
recommendation would have many others

449
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,320
but i think is the most important one

450
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,910
okay so we can move to banks for example

451
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,610
we hurt a lot of it so you love

452
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,440
regulation again new one so what is the

453
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,659
what is the tag of the banks because for

454
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,490
example especially in this region to

455
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,530
make it happen and functioning cm you

456
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,680
cannot go along with alone without

457
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,770
paying so what is your perception how

458
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,560
can it work what needs to be done I

459
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:39,710
think first and foremost I have to share

460
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,800
with you that it's good to be here this

461
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:45,880
is Tucker summit I can sit here one year

462
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,830
before slovakia will take over the ue

463
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,290
presidency and I can sit here is the

464
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,990
shareholder representative of tata bank

465
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:56,720
being a very well trusted bank in this

466
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:59,930
country and being a bank that is in many

467
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,720
ways leading also within our group of

468
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:05,330
banks in verizon being innovative being

469
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,660
gold gators going ahead being ambitious

470
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:12,080
and for me it's a now listening to what

471
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:15,200
was said it kind of felt good that such

472
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,889
a complicated matter we discuss here in

473
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,520
Slovakia for us in our group our bank in

474
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:24,950
Slovakia bruh tatra banka very often was

475
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,920
a little bit our laboratory when there

476
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,830
was a new idea they come here they come

477
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:32,840
forward we try it out and we see how the

478
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,500
test balloons fly and then we take it

479
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,959
somewhere else and learn and try and so

480
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,040
on on the other hand let's be realistic

481
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,410
if you look at the correlation between

482
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:48,290
how well capitalised is a stock exchange

483
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,020
and what is in it maybe through a change

484
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:53,840
in regulation you take Europe as a whole

485
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:57,470
it has about sixty percent of GDP

486
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,209
p which is in stock exchange versus the

487
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,789
united states where it is double and

488
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,279
within europe you have countries like

489
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:06,529
the UK that is above hundred percent and

490
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:10,220
you have countries like slovakia where

491
00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:13,549
it is below ten percent so it is all

492
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,279
nice and whatever we can agree on here

493
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:19,340
it will have an impact and by essence as

494
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:21,470
a bank we can only be very positive but

495
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,520
we also must be realistic how relevant

496
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:29,570
it is when for which country but from a

497
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:33,529
banker's perspective the the world is

498
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:36,770
relatively simple we are we are standing

499
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:38,980
in the real economy without real

500
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,960
customers we are serving more than

501
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:45,409
800,000 legal entities most of them

502
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,210
small enterprises they are they are

503
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,730
there and they want to do their business

504
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:52,730
and if I look at the economic

505
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:56,289
environment unfortunately still it is

506
00:20:52,730 --> 00:21:00,770
relatively weak we have very

507
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:03,169
advantageous macroeconomic effects we

508
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:07,750
have very low energy costs thanks to the

509
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:10,220
low oil price we have a beneficial

510
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,799
circumstances for the exports of Europe

511
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,409
into the dollar area thanks to the

512
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,289
relatively weak Europe against the

513
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:21,409
dollar and still we are just making one

514
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:25,549
percent gdp growth so imagine we would

515
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:28,130
not have this positive aspect so how can

516
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:31,668
we stimulate growth for the real economy

517
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:34,490
this must be our question and this is

518
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:36,500
how can we make sure that our companies

519
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,289
are growing that they go forward that

520
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,460
they have new ideas that they have faith

521
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:47,870
and for this capital in itself is good

522
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:50,330
and now look at the disparity there is a

523
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:53,469
lot of capital which in principle is

524
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,610
available that is looking for investment

525
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,190
everybody who is a banker or who is a

526
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,799
customer saying I don't get anything for

527
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,600
my deposit yeah why don't you pay me

528
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,789
more a mighty positive I give you my

529
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,730
money and then they look for alternative

530
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:07,879
investments and if you take the region

531
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,059
of

532
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:13,958
Central and Eastern Europe you see to a

533
00:22:11,059 --> 00:22:17,389
large extent relatively small countries

534
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:19,699
relatively small portfolios and then how

535
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:23,289
can you mobilize that how can you pull

536
00:22:19,699 --> 00:22:26,269
that how can you facilitate cross-border

537
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:29,089
structures in securitisation and pooling

538
00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:31,909
of receivables and so on so forth and in

539
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:34,219
this aspect as it was said the intention

540
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:37,339
of the capital market union is very very

541
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:41,449
good I think it has all the ingredients

542
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:44,448
if it would be implemented as thought to

543
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:47,749
boost the cooperation and economic

544
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:50,899
environment within Europe but if even

545
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:54,019
the expert says the paper is in no known

546
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:57,439
language and it needs an animus

547
00:22:54,019 --> 00:23:00,229
decisions then this is underlying my

548
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,239
frustration because one of my most

549
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:05,839
frustrating days is when I spend the day

550
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:09,079
in Brussels because I just miss this

551
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:11,208
common language between the people who

552
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:14,779
in all good intention make regulations

553
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:17,539
and try to bring on paper rules and

554
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:19,519
procedures how we can support and boost

555
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:23,719
the economy all what we want to do

556
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:26,329
together with a man like me who is more

557
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:28,369
coming from the from standing in the

558
00:23:26,329 --> 00:23:31,759
world talking to customers trying to

559
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:34,519
steer a group and then we don't find

560
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,909
together easy yeah and here if I hear

561
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:40,849
that at the end of the day we must come

562
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:43,789
forward with a unified tax regime with a

563
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:47,269
unified insolvency of regulation with

564
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:50,899
the with the unified supervision I mean

565
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:53,329
this is far far away and that means that

566
00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:55,428
it is a long road until we can achieve

567
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:58,129
that and in this aspect of fully agree

568
00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:01,549
with Marcos that 2019 is an ambitious

569
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:05,178
timeline if really that should be the

570
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:07,309
effect to make it happen because that

571
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:10,489
needs a lot of concessions on the

572
00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:13,819
national level to achieve this okay so

573
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:15,559
if you take it okay let's assume you are

574
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:18,079
a small immediate and bright enterprise

575
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,730
you need or you want to find new

576
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:22,460
alternative way to of

577
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,770
thing and it's a long long road ahead

578
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,350
with like the overall umbrella of CMU

579
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:30,440
what would you do in the short run let's

580
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:32,629
say in 22 years it was small as a small

581
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,180
enterprise he will do nothing different

582
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,280
than what he does now he goes in the

583
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:40,550
next branch he talks to his friendly

584
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,370
banker in his own language and he says

585
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:46,399
what is his financing need and he should

586
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,070
get this somehow through his bank if now

587
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,310
the bank is granting him alone

588
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,980
straightforward or not then the bank in

589
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,960
the second stage can bundle that can

590
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:59,630
structure that can make a securitisation

591
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,880
out of that and through this mobilize

592
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:06,380
the balance sheet and instead of

593
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:08,900
simplifying giving hundred loans 200 s

594
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,760
ii companies by having a

595
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:14,000
well-functioning securitisation

596
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,120
procedure you can give 200 loads to 200

597
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,540
companies but the customer facing side

598
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,850
must be very simple I mean I can only

599
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:26,720
say for Austria for example ninety

600
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:30,350
percent of the SE companies have less

601
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,750
than 15 employees and on the top of this

602
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:35,870
company is somebody who is a good

603
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:38,770
carpenter a good painter a good tailor

604
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:42,320
but he is definitely not an egg

605
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:44,480
engineering so we have to keep the focus

606
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,510
for these people on their businesses and

607
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,210
all financial service providers then

608
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,190
must be the intermediaries and

609
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:54,290
facilitators but not to try to make

610
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,480
bankers or capital market specialists

611
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:59,090
out of these people that would be a

612
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,240
total nuisance so we must make sure that

613
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,550
this intermediation works well and

614
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,790
therefore I think the role the bank's

615
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:10,610
can have is to speak up on behalf of

616
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:13,639
their customers and try to make things

617
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,620
practical well that brings me to mr.

618
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,960
pastor when you look at the region

619
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:21,110
especially Slovakia for example what is

620
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:24,080
the the problem is literacy as we just

621
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:27,080
heard of the investors so what can be

622
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,790
done in this in this area and what else

623
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,320
can be done especially in Slovakia

624
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,668
because banks have limitations and

625
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,730
cetera

626
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:35,950
what about pension funds and where do

627
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,629
you see all these benefits for for the

628
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:41,769
light side of v4 region or maybe in

629
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:44,350
general right so Slovakia doesn't really

630
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:46,600
have capital markets let me know if we

631
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,248
have a little bit of trading on our

632
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,149
local exchange but most of it is

633
00:26:48,249 --> 00:26:54,970
government bonds and hung a little bit

634
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:57,279
corporate bonds stocks almost negligible

635
00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,669
you mentioned the ratio of the stock

636
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:02,739
market capitalization to GDP in Slovakia

637
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:05,200
was less than ten percent it is pretty

638
00:27:02,739 --> 00:27:07,779
much at the bottom of the OECD it's

639
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,629
below that of several African countries

640
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:15,309
so we don't really have much in terms of

641
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:17,498
capital markets however that need not be

642
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:19,178
a problem any people talk about there

643
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:21,039
being different levels of development in

644
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,720
capital markets across Europe and how

645
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,629
that could be problematic I'm not so

646
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,029
sure because once you have a single

647
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:30,189
market which is the objective here to

648
00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:32,950
have a single market to which any firm

649
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:35,109
can go an issue capital any investor can

650
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,559
go and invest it doesn't really matter

651
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:41,980
what the local market conditions are so

652
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:44,019
I don't think that I think Slovakia can

653
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:45,940
benefit tremendously from from the

654
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:47,859
capital markets Union in fact I want to

655
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,539
come back to that point I completely

656
00:27:47,859 --> 00:27:51,460
agree with the view expressed earlier

657
00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:52,840
that this is a great thing I think the

658
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,639
capital markets union is one of the best

659
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,879
things that have come out of the of the

660
00:27:54,639 --> 00:28:00,549
European Commission it'll be European

661
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:03,428
markets are underdeveloped not only

662
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:05,408
relative to the United States which they

663
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:07,899
are they're about half the size of the

664
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:09,759
US equity market about one-third if you

665
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:11,738
look at corporate bonds about one-fifth

666
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,179
if you look at venture capital even

667
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:15,460
though the size of the economy is about

668
00:28:13,179 --> 00:28:17,470
the same but but you know the stock

669
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,359
market is smaller than in Australia or

670
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,629
China if you look at it as a fraction of

671
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,939
GDP so they are underdeveloped and we

672
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:26,879
would benefit from Mendez Lee from more

673
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,710
highly developed capital markets

674
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:30,939
individuals would benefit they would be

675
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,399
they would get access to better

676
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,980
investment opportunities a better risk

677
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:37,779
return trade-off lower fees on

678
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,460
investment products because in a single

679
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:42,279
market there's more competition than in

680
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:44,940
any local markets of huge advantages for

681
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:48,279
individuals house whole

682
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,960
firms would benefit because they will

683
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:52,720
get access to an alternative source of

684
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,809
financing you know when banks are

685
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,429
failing as they sort of have been in the

686
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:59,139
recent crisis you can go somewhere else

687
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:03,129
for capital you can go to capital

688
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:04,959
markets the firm cost of capital would

689
00:29:03,129 --> 00:29:06,879
likely be lower in an environment where

690
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,610
banks are competing with capital markets

691
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:12,009
and the society as a whole would benefit

692
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,559
from more developed capital markets we

693
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:16,299
would have a system more resilient

694
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,490
that's less vulnerable to a banking

695
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:20,769
crisis see part of the reason why Europe

696
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:23,679
has been in a crisis for so long unlike

697
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:26,950
the United States is that the US has

698
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,600
more developed capital markets and if

699
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:30,340
banks are not doing well well the other

700
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,199
the other part of the financial sector

701
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:34,658
picks up the slack in Europe we only

702
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,220
have the banking sector really so there

703
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:37,899
is no other half that could pick up the

704
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,750
slack when when banks are not doing very

705
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,879
well so huge potential advantages from

706
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:45,879
having more developed capital markets

707
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:47,379
now the I've heard here of you has been

708
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:51,070
expressed that this this plan is

709
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:53,168
ambitious and while while I agree that

710
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:56,110
the plan is ambitious in terms of its

711
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:57,879
ultimate objective I'm not sure that the

712
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:00,668
specific action plan that has been laid

713
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:03,219
out just a few weeks ago is all that

714
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:04,210
ambitious I mean it's fairly modest I

715
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,669
think these things that we're doing

716
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:09,129
standardizing securitization a good

717
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:11,799
thing no question simplifying a

718
00:30:09,129 --> 00:30:15,250
prospectus good thing reversing some

719
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:17,320
recent harmful regulation solvency to a

720
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,700
good thing but these are all relatively

721
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,309
small stuff these are all good things

722
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,129
but but small these are he says these

723
00:30:21,309 --> 00:30:25,570
are baby steps in the right direction

724
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:28,509
that's the way I would look at this and

725
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,689
this isn't an environment where there

726
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:33,129
are major headwinds to capital markets

727
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:35,860
so the same time that we're making these

728
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:37,779
these baby steps forward there are other

729
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,459
things that are sort of blowing against

730
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:42,100
us there are there's a low interest rate

731
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,899
environment that is not conducive to to

732
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,928
capital markets including pension funds

733
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:48,729
that you've mentioned and moreover there

734
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:51,370
are other actions that are coming from

735
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,049
the top that are there going against the

736
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,090
development of capital markets so let me

737
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:56,350
go back to the European Commission for

738
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:00,030
years ago

739
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,959
the European Commission proposed a

740
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:06,668
financial transactions tax in Europe and

741
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,830
right now there are 11 of the 28

742
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:11,200
countries in the EU that are supporting

743
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:15,330
the financial transactions tax including

744
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:19,030
Slovakia including Germany France Italy

745
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:21,760
and we'll see I mean this could actually

746
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,710
happen see the financial transactions

747
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,710
taxes if it happens will reduce

748
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,919
liquidity in capital markets will reduce

749
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:32,200
liquidity in what are already illiquid

750
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:34,659
markets financial transactions tax is

751
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:38,710
the best thing you can do if you go is

752
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:40,450
to kill capital markets so we have the

753
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,190
Commission here on the one hand pushing

754
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,080
forward the capital markets union which

755
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,700
i think is a wonderful thing and that's

756
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,250
helping that strengthening capital

757
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,140
markets and on the other hand pushing

758
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,350
for the financial transactions tax which

759
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:56,980
i believe is weakening capital markets

760
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:59,530
it's a little bit like saying we want to

761
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,360
promote football we want all Europeans

762
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,690
to play football and by the way every

763
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,459
time you kick the ball you pay one euro

764
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:09,640
so I'm not even sure what the net effect

765
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:11,650
of this is I think if we continue taking

766
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,850
these baby steps forward but but we

767
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:15,750
actually enact the financial

768
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:20,949
transactions tax we might end up behind

769
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:23,200
where we were a few years ago okay so

770
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,789
you will like suggest to kill the FTT

771
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,100
maybe we can try to slip it into the

772
00:32:24,789 --> 00:32:30,129
conclusions for Tuesday there you go can

773
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:34,559
you put it on the agenda please let's

774
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:36,820
see I lost my I can ask the minister

775
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,470
when we touched for example the stock

776
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,970
exchange so we can maybe get the

777
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,950
perspective from Vienna Stock Exchange

778
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,980
what in your perspective are the

779
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:47,799
greatest challenges to the EMU and if

780
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,150
you capital markets Union it and what

781
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,360
will be the starting position of in a

782
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:53,530
stock exchange in this whole process

783
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,689
well I couldn't agree more with

784
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:58,860
everything which has been said so far

785
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:02,289
and the financial transaction tax as the

786
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:05,949
counteractive measure which is right now

787
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:08,049
still on the discussion I do hope that

788
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:11,169
most of the people actually already have

789
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:14,320
ticked it off but it's something is like

790
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:16,659
one of those one of those goats like a

791
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,000
Halloween they're popping up again every

792
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:22,260
once in a while unfortunately we cannot

793
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,200
bury them they're living like zombies

794
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:28,179
anyhow I did this is something which

795
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,740
which which is which is definitely the

796
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:32,139
problem now many things have been

797
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:34,990
touched on especially also by carsten

798
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:36,789
what we what we would need actually on

799
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,279
the harmonization side I think there are

800
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:41,460
many many things which are stepping

801
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,830
stones towards the capital markets Union

802
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:47,110
but your second part of the question to

803
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:49,090
me has been has been touching on where

804
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,949
are we coming from what what is what is

805
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,260
the current status on the Vienna Stock

806
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:56,110
Exchange and I think this is more or

807
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:58,570
less a proxy for most of the countries

808
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:01,389
here in Central and Eastern Europe we're

809
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:04,178
all living on a backbone which is made

810
00:34:01,389 --> 00:34:05,559
of small and medium-sized enterprises so

811
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:07,630
especially for those small and

812
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,730
medium-sized enterprises the capital

813
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:13,300
market union is definitely a very very

814
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:17,349
positive endeavor a good step forward a

815
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:19,359
vision to work on because and I want now

816
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:21,280
not to touch too much on the only other

817
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,918
things like the harmonization which we

818
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,750
need on the taxation side and maybe

819
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,299
frustrations which might come on the way

820
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,980
we need definite dose of harmonization a

821
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,379
company law outside on the insolvency

822
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:35,079
law outside on many many things actually

823
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:36,848
to move the fort and there are maybe

824
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,589
there's two points I would like to make

825
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:41,679
the one has been kind of half mentioned

826
00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:43,750
the other one I would like to elaborate

827
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,649
a little bit more maybe the first one is

828
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:49,300
that what whatever we we need in going

829
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:50,949
forward is now not only a strong

830
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,069
commitment from the European Union

831
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:56,770
institutions on that and including and I

832
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:59,529
don't see much to enough of that

833
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:02,319
currently is really going out also to

834
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:05,290
all the member states in these kind of

835
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:07,420
formats or other formats and market that

836
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:10,390
idea I mean I've heard Commissioner hill

837
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,250
in in in London and it's a great thing

838
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,440
if you start saying the first first

839
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,849
thing he wants to do is down thirty

840
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,680
percent of regulation which we have

841
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:18,360
because just the bird is just not

842
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,029
helping

843
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,880
good first step but we need to go out

844
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,860
and explain also your language topic we

845
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,170
need to go out and explain what it is

846
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,300
all about because we do not know only

847
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,220
need to have this commitment under

848
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,440
European institutions level we do need

849
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,220
to have the commitment on each and every

850
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,520
of the 28 EU member states and we do not

851
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,759
only need to them actually also act in a

852
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,080
local in the local environment as a

853
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,460
supporter to all the initiatives which

854
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,259
might come out of this and there is

855
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:52,200
going to be a lot of them but we also

856
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:53,520
need them to strict refrain from any

857
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,259
other actions which are actually

858
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,670
counteracting the financial transaction

859
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,140
tax would be one of those things and

860
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:02,100
austria's by the way also holding up the

861
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,890
flag which which is really coming top

862
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:09,110
down and the other way around and

863
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:11,580
looking into the also very current

864
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:16,020
situations or a political landscape in

865
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:18,049
Europe is not making me very positive on

866
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,400
looking ahead because there are so many

867
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:23,130
local and nationalistic interests

868
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,680
popping up over the last months and

869
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,440
years again which are as I said they are

870
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,750
dampening my enthusiasm that we will be

871
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,090
able to achieve that another topic which

872
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:36,120
was not yet been mentioned which also

873
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,980
plays into why are the US markets so

874
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,960
much bigger why are there so much more

875
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,870
developed on the equity side is

876
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,270
definitely the European history and many

877
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:46,950
of our country's people have been have

878
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,420
been used to put in their money into

879
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:52,980
savings books and that's it they have

880
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:54,750
not been raised as investing into the

881
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,880
equity capital markets so there's

882
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,310
definitely something where we need also

883
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,690
abroad campaign both on the European and

884
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:07,529
number on the local levels on bringing

885
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:09,480
more more information and knowledge in a

886
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,640
broad campaign on financial literacy

887
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,370
this is definitely something which which

888
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,799
we're missing currently we do a lot what

889
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,540
we can do as a small exchange within our

890
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,300
country but we need much much more of

891
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,490
that is also something about language is

892
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,380
also about something making people feel

893
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,660
more comfortable I sit on the airplane

894
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,430
next to a US citizen he does not know

895
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,348
who I am within 10 minutes

896
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:33,618
is going to talk about stocks and the

897
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:36,089
push and and a portfolio here is running

898
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:38,760
it is this is something which is I mean

899
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:42,450
if you if you also see value if I ask my

900
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,160
ministers in in Austria and they tell me

901
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:46,919
oh why by the way over talking to the

902
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,690
stock exchange guy now and we start with

903
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,630
some small talk and they say well i I've

904
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,910
been owning some stock lately and you

905
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:57,690
know we always have to to tell everybody

906
00:37:53,910 --> 00:38:00,779
to to the highest authorities what are a

907
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:02,609
wealth is made out of it and all of a

908
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:06,390
sudden I was aware that I was the only

909
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:08,220
one who was owning stock within the

910
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:11,578
whole government so of course I

911
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:13,500
immediately sold it and I I crazy you

912
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:15,599
have to stand up and say yes of course I

913
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,760
do own Austrian stocks or stocks at all

914
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,770
because I am supporting the Austrian

915
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,980
industry I am supporting jobs I'm

916
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:25,530
supporting growth so if we don't get it

917
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,150
into the minds of the politicians and if

918
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,480
we do not actually get this whole

919
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:32,640
concept of of equity financing on a

920
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,970
really broad basis from young to old

921
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:38,040
from all kind of of stakeholders within

922
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:39,540
the market we probably not going to

923
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,839
succeed but here I think also the

924
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,430
capital market student is a brilliant

925
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,220
vehicle to touch that sector as well

926
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,930
because at the end of the day once we we

927
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,629
count that and then if you look again

928
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:53,730
into into the u.s. those people there

929
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,740
are simply and I think it has something

930
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,130
to do with owning stocks because it's

931
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,750
the first way of ownership

932
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:03,960
entrepreneurship it might change in the

933
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:06,000
long run the minds of Europeans of young

934
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,180
Europeans becoming more entrepreneur

935
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,880
entrepreneurial thinking into the next

936
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,759
and descend and probably the next but

937
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,170
one generation I think this is if we do

938
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,150
it right this would be an incredible

939
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,579
achievement which we will of course not

940
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:22,770
see tomorrow which we cannot value

941
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:24,720
enough for for for the future of Europe

942
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,849
okay sounds good before we move on I

943
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,220
would like to ask mr. Coe so because the

944
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:30,480
bank is it has plenty of experience with

945
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,520
capital markets so what is your

946
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,410
experience as a bank and you touch also

947
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,990
issuance of the depth and you also do

948
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:39,990
access as far as recall domestic bone

949
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,870
placement so if you can please touch the

950
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:43,850
little issues well and explain how a boy

951
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:46,339
and what it's the experience thank you

952
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:48,860
very much it's great pleasure to attend

953
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:52,610
the tetris on it and great honor to

954
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:56,540
address these audience I will share with

955
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:59,870
you rather practical aspects well I Iran

956
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:03,259
IFI which is one of the oldest in Europe

957
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:08,210
but reshaped within the last three years

958
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:11,480
and combines nine very diverse countries

959
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:14,090
five EU members slovak republic Czech

960
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:18,440
Republic Hungary Bulgaria Romania

961
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:22,970
Russian Federation Vietnam Mongolian and

962
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:27,080
Cuba and we work on every market and the

963
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:29,839
problems we we see very much the same i

964
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:34,180
should say though they they have

965
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:38,210
different sharpness well i think very

966
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:41,629
major point in every discussion and in

967
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:45,380
discussion about CM you should be what

968
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:48,260
we are aiming at well at present i

969
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:52,210
should say that the banks should be held

970
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:55,660
to restore their function to help

971
00:40:52,210 --> 00:41:00,260
sustainable growth of national economies

972
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:02,960
what we are having in practice banks are

973
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,480
more and more pressurized by stiffens

974
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,810
different rules and regulations by

975
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:12,700
national regulators supranational

976
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:15,290
regulation basel committee and if that

977
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,089
tendency sustains that would move that

978
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:19,160
at the end of the day they will be

979
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:22,300
cornered to situation in which they will

980
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:27,170
only be able to buy Triple A bonds and

981
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:30,590
lend money to a rated entities and this

982
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:35,270
is obviously not the situation which we

983
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:38,690
should strive for in that sense I think

984
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:42,770
that more focused probably should be

985
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:47,720
made on anti fraud and money laundering

986
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:50,990
and non transparency operation

987
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:54,439
by the bend and obviously things which

988
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:57,740
are stipulated in the CMU very helpful

989
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,140
very helpful for example it was very

990
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:03,080
interesting for me to listen to the

991
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:06,410
