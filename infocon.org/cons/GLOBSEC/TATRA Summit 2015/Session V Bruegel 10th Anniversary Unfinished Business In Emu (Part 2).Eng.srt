1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,890
Thank You vice president for setting out

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,439
the European Commission's and your ideas

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,440
on what is the unfinished business in

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,420
the economic and monetary union I'm

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,540
pretty sure there's a few people on the

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,850
panel who maybe have a few things to add

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,070
and just before I start with the

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,529
questions I will very quickly point out

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,359
that you have the opportunities to send

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,539
the opportunity to send me questions

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,220
which I can then posed to the panelists

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,730
and you can of course at the end also

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,180
ask your questions in person and also i

14
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,648
have a question up here that would be

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,350
great if you could answer because i'm

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,600
very interested and also how people

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,010
beyond the brussels bubble and beyond

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,050
the sort of sphere when where these

19
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,920
things are discussed actually feel about

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,809
how to take our monetary union forward

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,120
and it looks at the level of risk

22
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,339
sharing and financial risk sharing that

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,468
we will need in the eurozone going

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,850
forward I'm very much looking forward to

25
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:09,420
your answers and to start out with I

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,280
would like to ask Peter Casimir because

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,049
I think we really need to get an idea of

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,430
what is the national perspective on this

29
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:16,170
because it's the Member States and

30
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,570
especially the finance ministers who are

31
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,950
feeling the impact of the crisis and in

32
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,020
Slovakia and for you as the minister

33
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,720
what has been the most annoying aspect

34
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,270
of monetary union in the most recent

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,420
years and what would be the best way of

36
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:40,500
fixing it as part of an overhaul of the

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:42,420
year of the monetary union expect but

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,579
the first of all I would like to touch

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,909
you up you know remarks beggin because

40
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,579
you you complain that nothing happened

41
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,350
were last that was the boring year

42
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,470
whereas you know that way you have been

43
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,798
redone it Dow colleague Greek colleagues

44
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,990
so that's that's the reason I but that

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,610
wasn't that was until August a fearsome

46
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,689
okay so so now we're in November so

47
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,550
talking about the so experienced you

48
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:13,470
know that we joined the eurozone and

49
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:15,870
first generate 2009 so and from the bomb

50
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,790
there's currency union has been

51
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,020
experienced the most severe economic

52
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:26,760
crisis in its history so which in and of

53
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,660
itself it's quite annoying you know so

54
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,040
it's it's froze from the beginning yeah

55
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,530
but we are lacking we are quite proudly

56
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,820
still we are proud member of the

57
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,890
eurozone and maybe somebody remember you

58
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,019
can remember that it was not so

59
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,839
difficult to become the part of this

60
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:49,820
club you know and especially special be

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,280
for crisis so so the crisis was really

62
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:56,730
wasn't something like eye opener you

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,200
know for instead showing that the

64
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:04,709
eurozone is is not so robust pillar of

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:09,480
economic stability as it's supposed to

66
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:12,410
be you know and so as a result of the

67
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,239
situation for country like Slovakia is

68
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:20,640
that it's a little bit unfair be the

69
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:23,989
country no like why is which is doing

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:29,488
which dude a fiscal and structural

71
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:34,110
homework at the national level but the

72
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:36,860
responsible policy choices are not

73
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:41,250
rewarded economically enough because

74
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:45,019
because the real situation the situation

75
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:48,060
into in the reason as a whole it's

76
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:51,299
translating on transporting this

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,690
troubles to the growth of GDP to the

78
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:56,910
problems with with labour market so not

79
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:00,269
reward but punishment sometimes you know

80
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:04,560
so and as it's also very difficult to

81
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:07,320
find that in such situation know so yes

82
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,750
I remember I remember times that we have

83
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,350
we have been the penalized for the

84
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,900
membership in this club you know so so

85
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:19,680
it happened but it's almost history I

86
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:24,510
hope so because the eurozone like like

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,160
well this mansion response to these

88
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,770
challenges

89
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,530
and this response was was very useful

90
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:38,370
but I think it was the crucial we have

91
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:41,280
to that that we the acting instead of

92
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,300
reacting i think this is this is our

93
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,010
thing it's very important to mention so

94
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,810
also what we should admit finally that

95
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,710
there is also the institutional problem

96
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:59,910
which is incorporated darkly in in in

97
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:02,599
this currency union and which is not

98
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,240
going to which requires a systemic

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,390
solution and talking about a systemic

100
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,020
solution so then we have to go back to

101
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:15,390
the economy to admissions and you know

102
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,109
the chemical literature has been saying

103
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:22,050
that it's quite easy and that the I've

104
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,150
just work what the currency union cannot

105
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,510
function effectively without the fiscal

106
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:31,799
Union you know this is just this is a

107
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:35,849
theory but this is all maybe this is a

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,550
reality so which kind of fiscal Union I

109
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:41,100
mean is I'm in the fiscal capacity to

110
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:44,910
cushion the Sharks symmetric and

111
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,700
asymmetric that's that it's also easy if

112
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:52,080
you want you because you call us to

113
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:54,810
irritate so I rotate it so thank you I

114
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,390
mean that's a very interesting idea this

115
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,580
embrace of fiscal Union from a country

116
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,169
that is usually one of the Hawks one of

117
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,940
the strict ones one of the ones

118
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,460
everybody needs to be responsible for

119
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,520
themselves so about his view does

120
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,430
Austria one fiscal Union and looking

121
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,590
back at the last few years what has been

122
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,200
the most annoying part of this euro zone

123
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:20,359
for you and your country and how can we

124
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,360
fix it thank you very much

125
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:32,810
because it sometime not easy to work

126
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:34,698
there you can see how this group your

127
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:38,500
group is working and we are all

128
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:41,360
interested point of use to develop

129
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:45,919
monetary them to a better design for

130
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,860
growth so if i look back for my period

131
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:51,530
for about 14 months being mr. violence

132
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:55,820
across yet but looking also back to the

133
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:59,619
history from the point of austria we can

134
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:03,380
say that for austria the membership

135
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:07,310
Union and in the Eurogroup success story

136
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:10,219
so it helped us very much in our

137
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,289
competitiveness all over Europe and it

138
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,910
helped us very much enlargement of the

139
00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:16,840
European Union is the neighbors face

140
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:22,419
time so we can finally important files

141
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:25,419
so something is going very well and

142
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,419
something

143
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:44,200
better is empty hopefully so of course

144
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:47,860
we have to do some things in another way

145
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:50,770
we do it now that's true one of them is

146
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,320
as I always say in Austria that is also

147
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,539
for the Austrian government not only for

148
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,730
the European Union we have sometimes

149
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,820
problems is between the competences and

150
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,710
the responsibilities who has the

151
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,500
competence and who is responsible and

152
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:08,080
it's very necessary what what is

153
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,600
Dombrowski said that the five presidents

154
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,419
report should help us to solve this

155
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,840
problem in the future the second thing

156
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:20,050
is the monetary union had brought a

157
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,450
plenty of advantages it's a monetary

158
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:26,880
union is a good idea for a unified

159
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:30,670
Europe but it's true that the community

160
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:35,080
and the processes and the state of work

161
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:36,940
in the community can be optimized so the

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,750
second thing which is a problem for

163
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:46,150
developing and finishing not unfinished

164
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:49,780
finishing the EMU is the question of

165
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:53,199
speed so we are often discussing for

166
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:56,140
years about a problem but we cannot come

167
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,940
to a result so one of the problems is we

168
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,790
have too much announcement from two

169
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,380
layers result and we should change this

170
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,510
and the hope that the five presidents

171
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:08,350
report will help us also to load this

172
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:11,710
problem and if you look to special

173
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:15,700
problems we have done a good job and in

174
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:18,190
something we have done not so a very

175
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,120
good job so let us speak about short

176
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:26,860
well very quickly about Greece there we

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:30,010
have lessened learned the third program

178
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,440
has more front loading before paying the

179
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,080
money as the first and second problem

180
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,279
club program together we have lessons

181
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,670
learned and that's good to do it

182
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,910
we have of course the problem that we

183
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:48,019
have some some discussions about the

184
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:51,209
government's in between the institutions

185
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:54,180
so sometimes I'm really astonished if

186
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:55,979
the president of the Commission peeps

187
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,050
have some information about the media's

188
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,720
about for instance deposit scheme or

189
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,639
other things that should be discussed in

190
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,170
between the institutions and therefore

191
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,910
the governance of the institution has to

192
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:11,370
be a question for the future one thing

193
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,740
which we can explain which is a problem

194
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:18,420
for us remember probably out of my

195
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:21,300
colleagues on the panel while it's

196
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,490
dubrovsky spoke about a very important

197
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:27,120
thing that's the banking Union it's one

198
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:30,629
of the really success things with the

199
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:34,610
Union did but they're the first step is

200
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:38,790
that we have to implement the BR rd

201
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:41,420
regulative and it is hot has not been

202
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,029
implemented by all the member states

203
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,639
eight of the Member States are lagging

204
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:54,389
behind but we are discussing about

205
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:56,790
things like the next pillow-like Deposit

206
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:59,100
Guarantee Scheme which is the third step

207
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:01,680
before we have finished the first step

208
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,050
so in my opinion we should learn lessons

209
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,790
make the first step then the second and

210
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,579
then dessert and they did not desert

211
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:12,959
before the second and the worst that

212
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:18,540
could as so end the discussion about

213
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:21,750
this probably unfinished Union another

214
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,500
example is breech financing we discuss

215
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:28,040
about many many times about the bridge

216
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:33,660
financing for the single resolution fund

217
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,550
and we have not a clear decision up now

218
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,449
maybe we get in on monday or tuesday

219
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:43,889
that could be possible but there are the

220
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:46,800
problems we have also in the aspect of

221
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:48,480
the image of the european union of the

222
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,650
commission and of course of the member

223
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,110
state what is the result

224
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:58,530
we have done probably some good things

225
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:01,310
but maybe not not fast enough let us

226
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:05,160
point out one of the Commission's

227
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,469
working program is paps that's very

228
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,750
important for the developing the

229
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,210
European monetary union because there is

230
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,900
the connection to the fiscal question

231
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:17,850
which is very important and if you look

232
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:21,660
how the world is changing in online

233
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,130
business and other things in in special

234
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,920
problems we have in the fiscal system

235
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:30,540
it's a good that we do is but we have

236
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:38,760
probably 22 if all these issues more

237
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:43,380
speed and we should remember if you

238
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:46,350
build a house every brick is an

239
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:49,830
important break but first you need a

240
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,720
good fundament it's not necessary to

241
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:58,980
build the chimney before the fundament

242
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:01,560
and therefore I hope that we can be as

243
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,589
successful as we have been in the crisis

244
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,089
I don't know who say did I think it was

245
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,130
really loose ain't never waste a good

246
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:11,160
crisis so let us learn out of this

247
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:13,410
crisis but as the Member States the

248
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,829
European Union has probably the same

249
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:19,920
problem that we have not changed from

250
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:23,670
Ede from administrating in a very good

251
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,800
way the crisis to design the development

252
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,400
for the future and that's the question

253
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:32,750
if we want to be successful by deepening

254
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,760
the European monetary union by

255
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,470
transferring the files president report

256
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,210
we have to remember that that is

257
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,790
necessary that we are thinking about a

258
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,660
vision for the future and not only

259
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:49,469
administrating the status we have now

260
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:52,319
thank you I'm Edwards kick Luna what's

261
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,600
the view from from Malta your this small

262
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,660
island a little bit separate from the

263
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,950
rest but you've still been paying for

264
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:04,370
all these bailouts and over the last few

265
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,020
years what has really gotten your gold

266
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,000
what is the thing that you don't want to

267
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:13,220
deal with ever again and how can it be

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,930
resolved well first of all I thank the

269
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,570
minister and then the organizers for

270
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:20,989
inviting me over here it's very very

271
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:24,560
important conference and let's take them

272
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,600
one by one I think for Malta and for the

273
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,569
Eurogroup in general it was has been a

274
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:34,820
very positive experience we're learning

275
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:38,300
step by step and it took the it was a

276
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,790
very testing time I must say and just

277
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,760
like a boat and its crew will be tested

278
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:46,550
during a storm not when it's a you know

279
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,339
very calm seas and it was quite stormy

280
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,260
it's agreed I mean we have never seen

281
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:56,240
anything of this sort in our own

282
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:58,339
lifetime and because we recall before

283
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,210
the crisis thinks in the European were

284
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:04,279
becoming a bit boring talking about

285
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,680
thousand and ten giving lip service here

286
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,839
and there so actually the this

287
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:12,020
earthquake this storm really shook us up

288
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:15,820
and started going and thinking seriously

289
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,770
about the limitations of the hour our

290
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:22,430
structure how strong it is or how weak

291
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:29,750
it is to extend these types of crisis

292
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:31,540
and and and shocks I if I were to so

293
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:35,380
that you know that's that's the positive

294
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:40,480
side and we are still working progress

295
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:43,279
we we must admit there were times where

296
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,770
where embarrassing for us I mean they

297
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:49,189
could have been done better and which

298
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:53,240
experience doesn't have this resource of

299
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:56,000
incidents I'm in the Greek case really

300
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,760
almost got out of hand and it was

301
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,790
difficult because it was also

302
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:05,060
unprecedented but I think looking

303
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:07,689
overall if there were two areas where

304
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,359
you you could have done better and

305
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:14,329
sitting back now and the first one is

306
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,710
that you would expect that since we're

307
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:18,420
not going on our own we

308
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:20,760
bus a group and we're talking about

309
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,579
coordination then there should be

310
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,890
coordination so our response to the

311
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,680
crisis unto the death surprise the

312
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:30,720
deaths crisis was that everybody does

313
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,560
the same thing and this is what was not

314
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,430
needed it was needed from countries like

315
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,040
Greece and and other indebted countries

316
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:43,109
but it shouldn't have been overall for

317
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,089
everybody because this is the kind of

318
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,090
aggregation and economics they tell you

319
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:50,300
about if one thing is good if everybody

320
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,780
does it it's not it might not be good

321
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:57,329
and the fact that surplus countries

322
00:16:53,780 --> 00:17:00,300
joined indebted and deficit countries

323
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:03,060
together and and and deflating so to

324
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:06,209
speak on on on a large scale put us

325
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:09,389
where we are now that that that we can't

326
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:11,070
just get out of this deflation we should

327
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:13,620
have had a more much more intelligent

328
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,839
and and because the experts were telling

329
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,469
up they were only we had our eyes open

330
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,720
and listened we you know the surplus

331
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,400
countries should have looked at their

332
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,740
own responsibility which would have been

333
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,540
different but what we did where we

334
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,250
looked at the most indebted and weak

335
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,970
countries and continued pressuring them

336
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:36,510
pressing them but there was nothing done

337
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:39,420
to those countries who could have

338
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,830
increased demand to compensate and we

339
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,050
must recall that especially the

340
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,840
Eurogroup we have a fixed exchange rate

341
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,790
we're all in with one currency so all

342
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,189
the models of the IMF which they've had

343
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,230
so many of them all the crisis since the

344
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,200
second world neo since the setting up of

345
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,720
the aisle I am f2 to date we're all

346
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,800
about countries who had a floating

347
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,400
exchange rate in the main and and so

348
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,960
while they were consolidating on inside

349
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,150
they had an external sector which

350
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,390
compensated and that we were fixed so

351
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:15,570
that is one area the other one it and

352
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:19,320
still with us is that the Eurogroup or

353
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:22,530
the European Union is not as good for

354
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,080
multitasking in other words its

355
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:28,250
concentrate on one issue with the

356
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,250
exclusion of the other and

357
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:34,570
you know this happened in our response

358
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,539
to the crisis but it's also about for

359
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,490
example the taxation methods they are

360
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:43,230
very important tax evasion tax avoidance

361
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:45,820
is the time and so on and we're all for

362
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,649
we know that it will improve the the

363
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,070
exchange of information would help also

364
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:53,110
the monetary union itself but not to the

365
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,240
exclusion of other things they should

366
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,059
have been in parallel and not you know

367
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:01,090
all the competitiveness issue where

368
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:04,840
we're paying lip service and we're off

369
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,269
our radar screen so most of our energy

370
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,330
and correctly was about banking

371
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:12,730
regulation and financial regulation and

372
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,168
then coming up and topping it with the

373
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,629
banking Union which I agree with my

374
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,480
colleagues that it was a success and and

375
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:21,519
we just hope as it has been done in our

376
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,700
country we've we've passed all the

377
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:30,279
legislation regarding the BIR d and the

378
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:33,700
IGA will be approved in a week's time so

379
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:35,850
I just wish my colleagues would join and

380
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,870
make sure that by the first of January

381
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,428
all the countries will have the

382
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,008
legislation in place because this is

383
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:45,419
very essential we've been successful and

384
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:48,879
therefore we want to at least complete a

385
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:54,779
very big but successful project and

386
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:58,059
bring it to its implementation but going

387
00:19:54,779 --> 00:20:01,360
on Pitou the competitiveness issues are

388
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:04,720
now being discussed now I mean we're

389
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:07,809
about seven eight years you know after

390
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,899
the crisis and and this was our weakness

391
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:12,399
I mean the European Union and the end

392
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:17,529
and and the Eurogroup in the

393
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:20,439
international arena is is is is is

394
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:21,909
telling and and and it is now that we

395
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,070
reckon we will support you know

396
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:27,039
competitiveness Authority the fact that

397
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,678
if our own fiscal councils will be like

398
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:32,019
internal auditors with the fiscal board

399
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,730
being the external auditor then this is

400
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:36,460
something which is very very important

401
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:39,250
it will strengthen as a minister each

402
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,100
national ministers hand in controlling

403
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:45,190
expenditure and keeping to the focus of

404
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,780
deficit well overall there were a lot of

405
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,880
positive things the country specific

406
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,910
recommendations at least in our case

407
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,789
we're just on the dot these were the

408
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,950
kind of agenda any government should

409
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,230
have taken and it was very comforting to

410
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,600
see that the Commission was seeing the

411
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:06,400
same view of where our strengths and

412
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:11,168
weaknesses are so overall we've learned

413
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:15,760
few lessons where the worst is behind us

414
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:18,490
and we should now build on these on

415
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,070
these on these experiences and

416
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:24,490
concentrate on competitiveness you know

417
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:28,240
we cannot delay this such an important

418
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:30,730
topic because we're always repairing

419
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,419
repairing here and patching there but

420
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:37,240
overall are we in a good strong position

421
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:40,870
to race with other regions with other

422
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:45,640
blocks and come to the front as we

423
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:49,209
deserve well we've got a long track to

424
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,340
go there and control you're actually

425
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,770
German but you I think you've been in

426
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:57,789
Brussels for long enough to take sort of

427
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:59,799
the view from the top and tell us what

428
00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:03,340
is the one thing that has really annoyed

429
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:05,530
you in the last few years and what is

430
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,610
the one that policymakers the people up

431
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,370
here in the panel who are taking

432
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,629
decisions on our monetary union what is

433
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,229
the one thing that they should really

434
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,120
focus on now and get done well thank you

435
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:18,429
very much first of all for for this

436
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,889
question I mean of course for for me as

437
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:23,020
a as an economist and the thing tanker

438
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,059
we are having a good crisis because

439
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,870
whenever there's crisis there's demand

440
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:30,970
for for expertise so so in that sense

441
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:35,168
I'm not unhappy about it but of course

442
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:38,049
of course I'm unhappy about let me say

443
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:41,909
really three things the first one is

444
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:44,770
that GDP performance of the euro area is

445
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:48,400
about as bad as it was during the Great

446
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:50,168
Depression and I think this is this is

447
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,340
not a very good benchmark against which

448
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:55,380
we are measuring ourselves so certainly

449
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,750
need

450
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,810
improvement I'm also not happy about

451
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:03,210
youth unemployment in the south of

452
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:06,720
Europe I think it is at in acceptable

453
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:10,980
high levels and let me also quite

454
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,020
frankly say when you go to to Asia and

455
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:15,720
you know that Asians are very polite and

456
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:18,210
you know if even Asian friends tells me

457
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,480
when will you Europeans finally get your

458
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,760
act together you sort of fear that also

459
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,600
the rest of the world sort of once the

460
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:31,260
eurozone ready to to move and to succeed

461
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,830
now my take is that the eurozone is not

462
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,200
an equilibrium we are unbalanced and you

463
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,850
know one of the things you learn when

464
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,930
when you go to graduate school it's

465
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:45,300
called by levis law you know so vilas

466
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,100
theoretician it's the foundation of new

467
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,190
classical economics I mean what he

468
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:52,080
basically says is if one market is not

469
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,520
in equilibrium then there must be

470
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,340
another market that is also not in

471
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,860
equilibrium and I think that's why we

472
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,780
should be extremely cautious thinking

473
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,060
that the disequilibrium that we

474
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,680
observing in the south of Europe just

475
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,960
concerns the south of Europe it does

476
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,820
concern also the north of Europe so I

477
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,340
think the imbalance in one part of the

478
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,960
eurozone is also an imbalance in the

479
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,590
other part of the of the eurozone

480
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:20,100
especially in the north and I think

481
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:23,570
you've talked about this advert I mean

482
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,070
that day is certainly the the issue of

483
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:28,200
adjustment in the south and there is the

484
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,850
issue of adjustment in the north and I

485
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,660
think we should not belittle belittle

486
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:36,570
that that problem it is about demand it

487
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,780
is about wage developments which

488
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:41,100
developments have been far out of line

489
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,470
compared to productivity in the south of

490
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,060
Europe in one direction but they have

491
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,530
been foul out of line in the north of

492
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,179
Europe in the other direction and I

493
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,940
think this is this is the fundamental

494
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:55,050
problem and that needs to be fixed and

495
00:24:50,940 --> 00:25:00,570
it's not an easy thing to fix now let me

496
00:24:55,050 --> 00:25:04,050
quickly quickly go go go on to other

497
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,360
points that that I think do you deserve

498
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,800
attention I mean one is of course this

499
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,199
whole discussion on banking Union

500
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,550
I think banking Union is of course a key

501
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,110
a key project via google have been

502
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:20,740
promoting and emphasizing the importance

503
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:24,389
of that project throughout the years as

504
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:26,860
early as aspect in 2007 some independent

505
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,380
economists even emphasize this before

506
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,939
the euro was founded now I think we

507
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,030
should be aware that at the moment it's

508
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,620
not finished yeah and that's why I think

509
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:39,460
it's a good thing that the European

510
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:41,830
Commission tries to to continue pushing

511
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,980
that agenda but of course that agenda is

512
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,720
an agenda that has to do not just about

513
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,190
risk sharing but also about risk

514
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,710
reduction and I think that's certainly

515
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:56,500
correct I mean we cannot have a banking

516
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,950
Union where you know basically the link

517
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:02,770
between banks and governments is only

518
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:04,960
cut through a sharing of risks on the

519
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,720
liability side I think we simultaneously

520
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,530
will you will have to make sure that

521
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:13,450
become the banks in their assets I'd

522
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:16,870
become more European meaning they should

523
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:20,140
have hold less over in debt of the

524
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,969
country in which they are located which

525
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:26,020
probably means introducing single

526
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:28,480
exposure rules and ensuring that banks

527
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:31,300
and other countries are actually ready

528
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,570
and allowed to buy sovereign debt from

529
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:37,600
from banks in in ephraim from

530
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:41,439
governments of other countries now last

531
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,659
point is still this this structure

532
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,330
structural reform discussion

533
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,580
competitiveness discussion I mean I

534
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,340
totally think that we need to we need to

535
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:55,689
take we need to take a global view on

536
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:58,480
this I mean we we are certainly not

537
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:04,210
performing as well as we want it is not

538
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:07,390
a reason to be happy if Greece improves

539
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:09,760
from number 72 number 60 on the global

540
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,830
rankings of competitiveness it's still

541
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,230
not enough I mean we need to if we want

542
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,659
to have our living standards we have to

543
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:19,120
become better in in what we are doing we

544
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,880
have to improve our education systems we

545
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,178
have to have better administration let's

546
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,940
go

547
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:28,649
option and so on and so I totally I'm on

548
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:32,169
the side of those demanding a very deep

549
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:34,029
deep structural reforms in the countries

550
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:36,759
that that perform the worst on those

551
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:39,519
corruption governance indicators and so

552
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:43,299
on this this is really an agenda for the

553
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:48,190
future thank you so not one easy quick

554
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:51,100
fix not surprising I guess and it seems

555
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:54,309
to me that in in these presentations and

556
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,869
also yesterday from the Eurogroup

557
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:58,950
president there were there was some

558
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:01,299
criticism of the European Commission

559
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,919
hence York shelling just mentioned that

560
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:05,080
actually maybe we're moving a little bit

561
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,690
too fast on the deposit guarantee scheme

562
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,100
maybe we need to implement the second

563
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:15,309
leg BRD which is which which allows the

564
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,080
investors in banks to two forces the

565
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:19,149
investors in banks rather to absorb

566
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,949
losses first before governments come in

567
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:22,748
and actually put money into these banks

568
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,700
that that needs to be completed first

569
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:29,080
then the your accrued president said

570
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:30,879
yesterday that the the European fiscal

571
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,059
board that the European Commission just

572
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:37,869
proposed a few weeks ago actually falls

573
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:39,580
quite a bit short from from what had

574
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:42,509
been in the five presidents report maybe

575
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:45,369
it should be given more power and more

576
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:47,350
more rights to assess national budgets

577
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:49,049
and then of course the multis finance

578
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,668
minister just pointed out that actually

579
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:53,740
maybe we need to be looking at the

580
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:55,149
economic policies of different member

581
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,490
states in the aggregate that not

582
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:59,590
everybody cut spending at the same time

583
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,379
which could be one of the things that

584
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:05,019
this fiscal board could do and so

585
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:08,139
vice-president Dombrovskis is the

586
00:29:05,019 --> 00:29:11,049
European Commission may be moving too

587
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:12,908
fast without too much without enough

588
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:16,299
coordination with the Member States or

589
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:18,490
are you in fact doing what we've just

590
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:20,499
heard from from mr. shelling that in

591
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,090
fact we need to move fast and always

592
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:27,749
talking talking talking is actually just

593
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:31,809
holding us back well i would say on

594
00:29:27,749 --> 00:29:33,130
those issues as regards economic

595
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:36,899
governance

596
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:43,000
it's extremely difficult to find a

597
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:45,640
consensus for some countries European

598
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,240
Commission is a ruthless enforcer of

599
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:52,330
austerity and we heard some views on

600
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,060
this for some other countries we are far

601
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,370
too generous in applying rules are not

602
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:01,120
strict enough we are not credible enough

603
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:08,110
in enforcing to build and respect same

604
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:11,469
with proposals on deepening of EMU some

605
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:14,110
countries are saying it's all too little

606
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,150
too late we must actually move right

607
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,760
away to stage two in five presidents

608
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,370
report and and and be much more

609
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,110
ambitious some are saying let's take a

610
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:25,209
break let's implement what we have

611
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:29,770
decided in recent years and we'll take a

612
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:32,080
look and so we're trying to find a

613
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:34,750
balance between those different opinions

614
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,649
and it's clearly that will not be

615
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:42,370
universally uploaded because they're

616
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:45,790
very divergent views among member states

617
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:49,209
so how quickly on which items we should

618
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:52,780
move but then on some specific elements

619
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,360
you raised for example on European

620
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,790
Deposit Insurance Scheme this is exactly

621
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,919
what I outlined also in the introductory

622
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:04,090
remarks that completing the banking

623
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:07,180
Union first means that we need to fire

624
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:12,100
finish what we have started including

625
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:14,740
full transposition of BRD including full

626
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:18,159
implementation of deposit guarantee

627
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:20,080
schemes directo including ensuring

628
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,390
bridge financing for a single ization

629
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,699
fund if we are to successfully move also

630
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:31,480
towards European Deposit Insurance seem

631
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:34,720
and of course all those issues are very

632
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,000
much linked and also European deposit

633
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,060
insurance scheme which is basically this

634
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,460
element of risk sharing also should be

635
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,350
accompanied with a further work in terms

636
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,660
of risk reducing in terms of market

637
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:49,139
potential

638
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:52,200
works on the risk exposures and and so

639
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:58,280
on and so forth so there we need to move

640
00:31:52,200 --> 00:32:03,120
on parallel on in both those directions

641
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:08,430
so and you can use other examples in in

642
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:11,669
other areas that it's not so easy to

643
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:14,430
find a consensus because opinions vary

644
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,860
quite dramatically among a member state

645
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:19,220
so what has been outlined in fi

646
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:22,740
president's report that it has an

647
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,420
ambitious yet realistic approach and

648
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,950
that's more or less what we are falling

649
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:31,950
to through also in our proposals mr.

650
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:35,040
Casimir I think by calling for fiscal

651
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,390
Union you are maybe if you just look at

652
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,580
the stages and the five presidents

653
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:42,150
reports skipping ahead quite a bit and

654
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:44,550
just to draw in a few questions from the

655
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:46,350
audience what exactly do you have in

656
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:48,659
mind when you think of fiscal Union I

657
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,909
mean we've spoken in the past about

658
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,640
having their small incentives for

659
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:56,250
structural reforms we've spoken about a

660
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:59,490
full budget we've spoken about an

661
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:01,320
unemployment fund what do you have in

662
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:04,500
mind what kind of fiscal Union for the

663
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,300
eurozone definitely we are not talking

664
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,040
about the Minister of Finance because

665
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,379
you know sometimes we are just beginning

666
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,080
from the structure who will be sitting

667
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,540
where but but you you were surprised

668
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:17,250
with that that how can so hawkish

669
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,770
country with the hawkish Minister of

670
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,840
Finance be committed to the fiscal Union

671
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:24,570
just explain we are hawkish to the

672
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,879
virality to them to the rules you know

673
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:33,419
and honestly I do believe in in federal

674
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,140
future of the Europe that's all despite

675
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,850
of what what mr. vice president

676
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:42,120
described as how it's how is difficult

677
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:44,580
to communicate inside of Europe

678
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,080
sometimes we are Italian family that's

679
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:52,949
that's true so this is a this is a

680
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:55,560
reality and talking about the timing you

681
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:58,250
know it's also important I can imagine

682
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:02,000
and the difference in our

683
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:05,060
in August with with with grease that we

684
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,570
are in integration we are speedy

685
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:10,549
gonzales you know now so because this

686
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,550
this could be completely different

687
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,350
situation in different environment but

688
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,929
this is history now and the reality is

689
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:21,649
that we have to be cautious and we have

690
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:24,110
to really to focus on on the work which

691
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:26,770
has been already done I do agree with

692
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:30,770
hans-jürgen on this for example on this

693
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:35,149
bridge financing I mean breadfan passive

694
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:37,580
financing of resolution fund and and I'm

695
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:40,129
really angry with with certain

696
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:43,699
colleagues because you know you are in

697
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:48,159
the country where the BRD was a full

698
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:52,668
integrated in the legislation eage

699
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,429
ratified we be a country with ex ante

700
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:59,440
deposit scheme fund we are a country

701
00:34:55,429 --> 00:35:02,300
with with real resolution national

702
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,870
resolution fathom it as a backstop I'm a

703
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:10,460
real money not just leverage in or

704
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:12,770
something virtual so so it's it's quite

705
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,930
difficult to explain to two people in

706
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,240
this country there are others you know

707
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,700
where where they don't have even this

708
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,520
excellent of fun so with with empty

709
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,899
pockets no so this is this is a

710
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,660
difficult so the first of all homework

711
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:33,320
do your homework and legend we can to

712
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,750
finish this this case on the deficit

713
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,770
scheme for example and talk about them

714
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:42,470
the fiscal Union so i really i don't

715
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:49,009
think that the jurong can reckon on in

716
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:50,870
its present form in the long term and BK

717
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:54,650
what we need it's the creation of

718
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:57,049
country country cyclical buffer which

719
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:00,140
would effectively administer temporary

720
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:03,110
fiscal transfers to cash in macro

721
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,390
economic shocks what it mean in such

722
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:07,550
instrument can take a form of common

723
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,279
european unemployment insurance scheme

724
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,630
for example

725
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,270
pyaar karle Padawan raised this issue

726
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:16,220
during the tongue presidency during the

727
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:19,130
informal a cofee this is a quite

728
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,799
realistic plan and could be

729
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:23,270
understandable to Europeans because this

730
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,060
is a really crucial because it's

731
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:27,740
sensitive issue the redistribution and

732
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,770
to transfer between between countries

733
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:33,200
but I think it could be quite visible

734
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:36,590
and and understandable to the people

735
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:41,529
this is a crucial so this is a this is

736
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:45,020
just a sample and talking about the

737
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:48,890
symmetric shocks so then it's we almost

738
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:52,700
have it so it's this this axon so it

739
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:55,100
could be the permanent FC so this is

740
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:58,009
just about the this could be the vision

741
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:03,710
you know and okay we need to be

742
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:08,600
pragmatic rome also was not built in a

743
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:11,720
day this timing I know that it's I think

744
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,220
it's it's right time to irritate us what

745
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,259
should do it's the role of the

746
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:17,660
Commission for example which is the role

747
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:21,080
is coming with the Commission is coming

748
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:24,529
with very enthusiastic plans so Alan

749
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,950
this is a good work has been done on

750
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:29,030
this issue mr. shelling coming from one

751
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,868
of the countries with the lowest

752
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:34,609
unemployment rates in in the eurozone do

753
00:37:32,869 --> 00:37:36,260
you think your citizens understanding

754
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:38,540
we're very well what it means to pay

755
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,030
into a common unemployment fund would be

756
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:44,270
happy to do so and hence support a

757
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:48,190
country like Spain where unemployment is

758
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:51,920
above twenty percent or like Greece oh

759
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:54,980
no they don't will understand so it's

760
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,109
not explainable in a straight way you

761
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,869
have to give another way of explanation

762
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:01,970
if it is necessary the second thing is

763
00:37:59,869 --> 00:38:03,440
there was no critics at the Commission I

764
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:06,890
think that the Commission makes a very

765
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,320
good job the problem is that most of the

766
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:13,430
member states don't understand that we

767
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:16,070
are Europe we are part of Europe and as

768
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:20,029
vice president of vodka say we have so

769
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:22,130
different meanings and positions where

770
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:25,339
we can find no consensus

771
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:28,730
it's always the same way the Member

772
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:32,630
States cannot find the consensus and and

773
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:34,160
the the Commission has made it in the

774
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,680
wrong way so that's always the same

775
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,690
discussion let make it clear it's not in

776
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,549
this way we are Europe we are member

777
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:44,779
states and we have to bring in our

778
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:47,299
positions and most of the content the

779
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:49,670
Commission brought in the last year

780
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:52,009
since the new commission is established

781
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:54,230
we are very very good look at the

782
00:38:52,009 --> 00:38:56,119
banking Union look at the discussion

783
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,460
about the capital Union look about the

784
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,460
five presidents report that's the right

785
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,099
way where we can bring together a better

786
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:06,529
results than we have it now the second

787
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:11,440
thing what is probably have to be done

788
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:13,940
is how we can find a better economic

789
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,819
coordination for that would you say how

790
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,529
we can raise the GDP that's very

791
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:22,009
important for Europe because let me

792
00:39:18,529 --> 00:39:24,440
point out just three figures Europe has

793
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:26,119
seven percent of all inhabitants of the

794
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:28,250
world of all people of the world of

795
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:30,730
seven percent from Europe going down

796
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:35,029
because other countries have a better

797
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:37,069
reproduction rate as it though the

798
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:39,529
second figure is twenty-five percent of

799
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:43,640
the worldwide GDP is run by Europe going

800
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:45,200
down but fifty percent of all spending

801
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:49,129
of the social systems are done by the

802
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,740
Europeans is that a model which we can

803
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,779
finance it for a long time or have you

804
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,750
think about other things so therefore

805
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:59,660
it's very important that if you have a

806
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:02,690
discussion about probably the GMG them

807
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:05,480
achieve 20 what is the role of Europe

808
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,000
not about is the role of a very strong

809
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,630
economic country like Germany what is

810
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,720
the role of Europe generating grows in

811
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:18,710
the euro area and in the world because

812
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,959
we need this to solve some problems so

813
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:24,769
the unemployment rate in Austria what

814
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,599
was your question it's going up one of

815
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:29,479
the problems is that Austria is a

816
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:30,280
growing country we have about 8.3

817
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,870
million

818
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:37,840
habitants and we are growing up to

819
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:41,310
probably nine million we are have a long

820
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,890
long tradition as a country for

821
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:48,430
immigration and the problem we have

822
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:52,150
solved is the same as as Peter said and

823
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:54,430
viola said this problem cannot also can

824
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:57,310
only be solved if you make structural

825
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,440
reform in all the systems and we have to

826
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:01,810
do this and we have to do our homework

827
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,090
in every member country not it's not

828
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:07,660
that not the responsibility of the

829
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:10,090
collision but what we also have to

830
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:13,270
discuss that didn't happen all-time high

831
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:17,350
of employees all-time high of aim please

832
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:23,320
so what we are doing now is we try to

833
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:27,460
find a way back to the growth we had

834
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:32,140
have 0.4 in the last in the year 2014 we

835
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:33,700
will have about 0.7 in the year 2015 and

836
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:35,650
we will double it in the next year

837
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,629
that's the good message we double it in

838
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:40,990
the next year just the Commission told

839
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:46,810
us 1.5 thank you well it's good message

840
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:49,509
for us but it's we have so many problems

841
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:52,420
in every member state solving

842
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:55,960
unemployment generating rose and so on

843
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:58,750
that it's not easy to explain to the

844
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:01,810
Austrian people why we should make a

845
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:05,560
deposit guarantee scheme why we should

846
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:09,160
make a european-wide unemployment

847
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:10,810
insurance because the people say we have

848
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,319
enough problems in our own country and

849
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:16,270
that's a very very big problem to find

850
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,410
the balance between the Solidarity of

851
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:22,830
Union Europe where we are a member and

852
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:26,560
the national point of view which is

853
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:30,130
political very difficult to explain not

854
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,799
so probably in the in the in the content

855
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:37,120
or about the issues but its political a

856
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,800
very big problem it's a problem in

857
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,299
between a coalition and its problem is

858
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,050
the opposition

859
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:48,870
pesty opposition mr. Skeel una so you

860
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:51,870
said earlier that we should there should

861
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:55,440
be more focused on the aggregate stands

862
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:58,740
of eurozone economic policies but that

863
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,410
also means for some governments to lose

864
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:05,399
some of their sovereignty what if you as

865
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:06,990
a as a country actually feel right now

866
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,430
is the right moment for you to cut

867
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,729
spending because you know that you

868
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:16,500
actually have some tension bills coming

869
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:18,330
up in the future or vice versa would you

870
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,860
be willing to give up this sovereignty

871
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:21,930
what and what does it mean does it mean

872
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,790
having a European fiscal council does it

873
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:26,399
mean having a European finance ministry

874
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:28,050
does it mean that your group president I

875
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,410
mean who gets to take the decision on

876
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:33,480
that but definitely a question of

877
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:35,250
sovereignty it's a political question it

878
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,600
belongs to the electorate is my

879
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,540
colleague was saying I mean they have to

880
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,339
decide what they are ready to give up in

881
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,710
order to obtain even in the country

882
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,120
itself when we give up you know when we

883
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:46,860
elect the government we give up certain

884
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,720
freedoms in order to obtain something in

885
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:52,080
return the same for taxation would pay

886
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,319
in order to get collective services so

887
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,930
however before I answer this question I

888
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,030
mean I I think I'd rather like to see

889
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,370
how are we going to be judged by our

890
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:03,930
children in the future would have we

891
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:06,000
made a good job I mean have we achieved

892
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:08,460
what we intended to achieve there are

893
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,590
going to lose themselves into this

894
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:13,050
legislation and the other one and how

895
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:16,620
many nights we've been kept awake in

896
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:18,240
order you know 22 and the media circus

897
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:21,810
and so on I mean we're going to be

898
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:25,350
judged where are we and and I definitely

899
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:27,120
agree with gone from here that finally

900
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,710
what would like would be that the

901
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,660
European Union especially the Eurogroup

902
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,640
will be at the top as far as the

903
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,149
competitiveness report whether the world

904
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,089
economic forum or the World Bank's Doing

905
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,280
Business one would like that the best

906
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:45,480
countries will be at the top and would

907
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,770
want to see our own Union being there

908
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:52,280
together and well at the moment we

909
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:55,730
not so these indices by the way whether

910
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:59,870
the taken by these institutions or by

911
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:03,100
Bruegel in the sense of advising have

912
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:03,100
been very sign

913
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,140
you
