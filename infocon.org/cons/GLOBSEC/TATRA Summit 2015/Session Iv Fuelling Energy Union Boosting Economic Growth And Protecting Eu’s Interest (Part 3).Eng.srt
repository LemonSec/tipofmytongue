1
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:30,119
economic growth and meeting our climate

2
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,420
goals are they are they not compatible

3
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,030
can you do both and we believe

4
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,759
absolutely you can I spent a couple of

5
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,350
weeks recently in Silicon Valley the

6
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,719
technological heart of the United States

7
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,428
I have to tell you there's nobody in

8
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,678
Silicon Valley that doesn't think

9
00:01:44,429 --> 00:01:49,170
there's money to be made in economic

10
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:52,649
growth opportunities in renewable energy

11
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,569
and energy efficiency programs in smart

12
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,929
grid technology in battery technology

13
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,640
and in fact companies in Silicon Valley

14
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:01,770
look to the east coast or the policy

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,869
makers are and think that we are far

16
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,000
behind the times talking about big

17
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,818
pipeline infrastructure I mean they are

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,919
busy working at the technologies that

19
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:13,679
are really going to drive growth in the

20
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:16,260
solar industry in the United States last

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,079
year we added jobs 10 times more quickly

22
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:23,069
than in any other industry or than the

23
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:24,390
industry industries as a whole so overt

24
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:27,500
well I think the International Energy

25
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,298
Agency estimates it between now and 2050

26
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,859
25 trillion dollars worth of investment

27
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,500
will be put into power markets globally

28
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:38,010
that's a huge opportunity and I think

29
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,750
that integrating renewables using new

30
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,819
grid technologies looking at battery

31
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,859
technology these are industries that

32
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,910
really can drive growth and good

33
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:52,739
competitive jobs some thanks well thank

34
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:56,609
you very much also for presenting to us

35
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:59,730
the involvement gas infrastructure

36
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:03,000
because usually on a very popular level

37
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:05,819
we always associate corridor South

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,819
Stream yes or no noticing sort of the

39
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:11,488
big the big things at the same time

40
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:16,589
there is a field competition there quite

41
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:21,780
a lot of publication behind us behind

42
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:24,870
Japan behind China now we are not so

43
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:30,180
competitive any more into what we move

44
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:33,090
to our final panelists invested and

45
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,200
being involved in a very wide variety of

46
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,190
energy salut

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,790
shins security and economic prosperity

48
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,829
in our conversation so far it's always

49
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,590
extremely interesting eight years ago

50
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:49,220
when it was made hell I'm still happy

51
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,959
but I realize it which may have landed

52
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,380
in difficult you're always trying to

53
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,390
find a long-term solution on a moving

54
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,319
problem because it's continuously moving

55
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:03,390
so it's very difficult to give a final

56
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,060
final answers to everything but I have

57
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,950
to say I agree with many of the of the

58
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,150
panelists before me and above all with

59
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:14,220
with robbing the future is technol parts

60
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,228
moving parts that makes it more

61
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,988
difficult of energy which end climate

62
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,820
change is technology so I'm just a

63
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,969
couple of examples the u.s. because they

64
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,650
replaced coal we natural gas why was it

65
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,560
possible because of new drilling

66
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:32,340
techniques then you have continuously

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,340
think about solar nowadays the only on a

68
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,060
same level they compete very well with

69
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,400
gas and in other fuels for the

70
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,919
production of electricity so in the

71
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,219
reality technology is the big answer I

72
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:50,070
would agree with with Robin that

73
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,960
definitely the u.s. is far more advanced

74
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,889
than us and I'm general talking about

75
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,659
the hardware but the thinking I was in

76
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,330
the US as well in April in a big

77
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,910
conference and you see that there there

78
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:07,080
is already a way of thinking of what

79
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:09,440
will happen to big utility companies one

80
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,880
day which is not that far we're

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,490
generation will be distributed so

82
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,680
everybody every house every every

83
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,870
industry will generate electricity and

84
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,330
send it to the grid what's the

85
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,789
usefulness of large of large companies

86
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,130
so you see this is a kind of debate I've

87
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:29,930
never seen in Europe so far it will come

88
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:32,789
but in the US is already like that so

89
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,220
technology is the answer I always am

90
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:39,409
also the head of all in gas not only

91
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,030
power and I always liked the words of

92
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,720
Sheikh ammani many many many years ago

93
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,330
when asked about fossil fuels will the

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,490
last forever blah blah

95
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,370
and he say the very famous words well

96
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:55,069
Stone Age didn't end because we ran out

97
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,379
of stones well the same thing will

98
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,180
happen here we will not stop using

99
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:00,650
fossil fuels because we don't find them

100
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,990
anymore but because we don't need them

101
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,359
anymore because we'll have other carry

102
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,389
thing but we have to pay attention

103
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:13,550
because political support but is there

104
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:16,400
until the energy is affordable watches

105
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,979
yes i do want clean energy i do want

106
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,710
anything hey and knowing ten ten percent

107
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:23,870
of the UK population is in a context of

108
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,628
energy poverty it's something which is

109
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,580
very very worrying if we want consensus

110
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,729
we have to build something which is

111
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,919
viable if not it'sit's too difficult now

112
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:36,919
coming back to the other point of energy

113
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:40,099
union I have to say being a practitioner

114
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,789
and I know very well what vice president

115
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:45,349
chef coverage says when he says talk it

116
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:49,250
doesn't mean talk for the sake of

117
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:51,560
talking it means trying to find trying

118
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,889
to hear everything in order to analyze

119
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,440
it and to finalize what we really want I

120
00:06:54,889 --> 00:07:00,710
have to say I like the new architecture

121
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,360
of the Union about energy there is a

122
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,580
vice president in charge of the energy

123
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,580
union and they call there is a

124
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:11,810
commissioner that put together climate

125
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:14,270
change and energy its logic energy

126
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:16,190
climate change are two phases of the

127
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,469
same issue why do you want to divide

128
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,779
them if you want to find a solution they

129
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:25,849
have to stay together then I have to say

130
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:29,240
fox vs words i am a practitioner i'm not

131
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,370
i do a lot of policy a policy making but

132
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,370
i mean at the end i have to decide

133
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,250
whether support lending or investing in

134
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,469
equity in energy companies but i have to

135
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,190
say vice president chef coverage has

136
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:45,560
been extremely factual more than

137
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:49,520
talkative i would say i'm thinking about

138
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,589
the the winter package I mean the winker

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,859
package has been has not been a mean

140
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:57,529
fact it has been a huge achievement not

141
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,599
enough in my opinion discussed within

142
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:00,710
Europe it's it has been very very

143
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,210
difficult I cannot

144
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,580
go into details and I don't want to go

145
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:09,229
into details but a lot of work has been

146
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:11,659
done putting together I have to say very

147
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:14,240
worried international financial

148
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,130
institutions multilateral banks to help

149
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,080
Ukraine and I have to say the United

150
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,200
States was so involved as well is not a

151
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,330
mean fat either I have to say you have

152
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,539
to understand that Ukraine is a country

153
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,400
with a CC plus kind of rating so you'll

154
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,940
know what he means it's a country which

155
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,799
has a huge legacy of missiles

156
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,890
misappropriation corruption and so on

157
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:40,490
and so forth it would be fanciful to

158
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:42,409
throw money just let's buy other gas it

159
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,660
doesn't work like that so you have at

160
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,880
the same time you have to provide the

161
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,250
money in order to have the political

162
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,890
consensus because can you imagine I mean

163
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,780
10 million people being in a condition

164
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,030
where they don't have eating it would be

165
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:59,120
a political instability close of

166
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:01,640
incredible proportion so you have on

167
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,390
this day on the one hand help and on the

168
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,860
other hand demand demand reforms demand

169
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,240
that processes are often transparent

170
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,940
competition is enforced and all the rest

171
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,670
which is not very very easy it's always

172
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,040
a difficult work and in particular case

173
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,760
of Ukraine it's it is something where

174
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,420
the legacy is very very very in-depth

175
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:30,040
very profound finally energy intensity

176
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:33,170
and I and I close the loop in this way

177
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,060
many countries where the ebrd operate at

178
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:38,390
the problem of energy intensity they use

179
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,609
too much intensity for producing one

180
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:42,560
unit of gdp this is a problem which is

181
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,230
all over but I have to say in South

182
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,969
account is very very big even in

183
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,040
Slovakia counter which I would a

184
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,340
knowledge is very much advanced but last

185
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,589
year this year we lent 150 million to

186
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:58,610
sloth neft for energy efficiency

187
00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:00,860
investments through the big four five

188
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,590
slovak banks we give money for

189
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,740
renewables and energy efficiency so i

190
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:11,030
think that you see in this polyhydric in

191
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:13,580
this multi-faceted kind of picture if we

192
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,420
want to address the problems of energy

193
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,970
you have

194
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,040
to use a lot of instruments a lot of

195
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,980
instruments at the same time financial

196
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,269
instruments technological instruments

197
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,670
policymaking because this is a regulated

198
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,850
business so you have to be in this way

199
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,370
and also last but not least vision and

200
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,199
that's what I have to say nowadays I

201
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,329
think we know more or less where we're

202
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:38,449
going obviously as I said it's a moving

203
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:41,449
target so it's an Isetta moment but it

204
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:44,060
may change so this is what I think we

205
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:45,469
are doing example the winter package I'm

206
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,660
thinking about the Iberian Peninsula

207
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,639
that has never been linked you should

208
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,610
know that in the Iberian Peninsula there

209
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:55,190
are six lng facility to the rest of

210
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,199
Europe you see our picture starts being

211
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,449
different and maybe the tradition and I

212
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:03,649
conclude by saying the traditional way

213
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:06,500
east to west must still be there because

214
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,180
it is a very very important thing but

215
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,040
also we have to look at the south the

216
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,219
south on one side on the other we have

217
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,349
to look at LNG because technology in LNG

218
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,870
is changing very very much now there is

219
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:22,190
no competitive but what about six seven

220
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:28,820
eight years last point one week ago the

221
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:32,720
price of gas in the US was 2.9 dollars

222
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:38,810
per BTU we pay around 10 so you can see

223
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:42,529
how the world can move thank you so we

224
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,599
we concluded the discussion with with

225
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:49,370
our panelists thank you very much for

226
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,350
emphasizing the the technology base of

227
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:53,990
the energy development and the energy

228
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:57,290
revolution I mean when we when we talk

229
00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:01,459
about there was a lot of investment in

230
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:06,079
in gas exploration led to that also led

231
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:08,420
to the development of probably an energy

232
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,000
device on earth or the Tesla battery

233
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,579
acid with the investment in technology

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,810
so we probably remember that especially

235
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:21,469
since our panel and our discussion is

236
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:25,130
about how to to bring together the

237
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:28,420
energy security and competitiveness so

238
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:31,130
we should look at this too

239
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:35,180
sites thank you for bringing the energy

240
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:38,390
intensity and energy efficiency into the

241
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,640
picture I was a bit surprised pleasantly

242
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:46,250
surprised bunk there as the public is

243
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:50,810
voting now on we one of the votes a

244
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,790
jetting solution but let's see the quick

245
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,130
comment which of the following is the

246
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,260
most important for the EU energy secure

247
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,439
that's usually the underdog of the

248
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:03,530
political conversations probably because

249
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:07,490
everybody and the second comes gas

250
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:10,280
import diversification renewables is at

251
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:12,200
certain percent only and probably very

252
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:20,260
disappointing for some people EU gas

253
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:23,600
exploration is zero so i'm i'm i'm sure

254
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,490
i'm sure you can still have an

255
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:32,440
opportunity to change the results of

256
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:35,720
this poll but that that's an interesting

257
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,930
look and should the energy union include

258
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,360
countries that are not members of the EU

259
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:44,810
seventy-seven percent say yes i mean

260
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,350
this is a very interesting issue and i

261
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:49,699
have said when we discussed the

262
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,620
achievements and the development of the

263
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,190
energy union and what the energy union

264
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,410
is I mean what energy Union and mr.

265
00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:01,280
frigid with the development and building

266
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:04,640
the CSEC group which is quite

267
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:09,709
extraordinary in a way and it does

268
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:11,689
include non EU member states probably

269
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:15,200
just a very quick question to mr.

270
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:18,830
serridge how do you see the inclusion of

271
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:24,110
non EU member states in the energy union

272
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:26,030
I said it's up to several times and I

273
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,890
think I I will be very happy to repeat

274
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:31,069
it here that it's quite clear that the

275
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,780
energy union shouldn't stop at the EU

276
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,260
borders because it's quite clearly the

277
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,600
electricity or beat it was very rightly

278
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,769
highlighted in energy efficiency we

279
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,559
clearly if you look at

280
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:45,600
renewables I think they primary nature

281
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,519
is that they really do not recognize the

282
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,110
territorial borderland I mean sometimes

283
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,809
you have more Sun sometimes you have

284
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,480
more weight you need to cooperate on

285
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:56,429
regional basis but I agree with the poll

286
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,679
that for sure that they will be

287
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:01,429
competitive and for sure energy

288
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:05,429
efficiency we play increasingly be grow

289
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:07,619
we tend to forget the fact that for

290
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,869
example 1 percent we can import by

291
00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:12,329
two-point-six percent lights of gas I

292
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:15,809
think so it's clearly it's a factor in

293
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:18,899
making the calculations how much how

294
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:21,719
much gas how much because we would need

295
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,749
in the future and that was one of the

296
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,269
reasons we and I'm very happy that also

297
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:29,069
solid investment holding decided to have

298
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:32,129
energy efficiency as one of the top

299
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:33,959
priorities because part of that summer

300
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:37,049
package for the next year we want to

301
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,689
introduce this new instrument the smart

302
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,009
financing for smart building tool by

303
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:42,779
which you would like to kind of

304
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:45,029
encourage to star these energy

305
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,759
efficiency wave across Europe because

306
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:50,579
there is a lot to gain so to gain in the

307
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,920
industry and I think here we have to be

308
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:54,989
really proud because our European

309
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,939
industries twice as energy-efficient is

310
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,819
the American one but we still know there

311
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:02,368
is a lot of opportunity to improve our

312
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:04,498
energy efficiency but especially in our

313
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:06,209
buildings in our residential areas these

314
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:08,600
are projects which are supported by the

315
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:12,719
people these are the projects which are

316
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,519
very much supported by the local

317
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,649
authorities by the mayor's they need

318
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,929
advice they need feasibility studies

319
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,819
they need energy audit and they need

320
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,259
financing and this is something what we

321
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:24,240
need to provide because I'm sure that

322
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,110
this would be the money very well very

323
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,629
well spent which would bring multiple

324
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,249
positive results energy efficiency being

325
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:34,199
the first but of course clean

326
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:36,089
environment the lower energy bills were

327
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,459
there for the customers and just one

328
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:41,269
comparison for for Ukraine how energy

329
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:44,790
efficiency is important we just made our

330
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:47,669
calculations and our modeling and we

331
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:50,349
just concluded that if the Ukraine would

332
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:53,680
be s energy efficient this

333
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:56,800
well as the EU average country so they

334
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,040
would save that much energy in one year

335
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,250
as it is spent consumed by such a

336
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,040
country like Spain so you cryin would be

337
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:09,130
energy exporter and not import so that's

338
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,829
the potential which is still there these

339
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,600
are the project which we support jointly

340
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:15,550
with international financial

341
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,219
institutions and I really would like to

342
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:21,430
thank you Ricardo and his bank for being

343
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,220
the first for putting the first founding

344
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:27,100
stone into this construction of the of

345
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:31,060
the financing instruments for these

346
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:32,740
heating seasons because when we started

347
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,139
the discussion on this issue in the

348
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,880
yearly June we realized that it's very

349
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,800
challenging that we have international

350
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,450
institutions which because of good

351
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,180
reasons been quite worried to go into

352
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:46,840
the project but we managed to do it we

353
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:49,150
did it together and thanks to the ebrd

354
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,980
as a pioneer in this respect we managed

355
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,570
to pull other international financial

356
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,910
institutions to work on this project

357
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,280
together and I think we ended up with a

358
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,920
very positive positive results so these

359
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,290
are just a couple of reactions have the

360
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,600
renewables energy efficiency and good

361
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,659
cooperation and well targeted financial

362
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,429
support can really bring the multiple

363
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,860
results in increasing energy security

364
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:14,050
and doing it in I would say this

365
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,580
environmentally very very friendly

366
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:21,310
energy efficient way thank you we have

367
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:26,169
10 minutes for a few questions from the

368
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:29,740
audience your first and I'll collect to

369
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:31,720
take questions and then yes please thank

370
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,780
you very much you gotta go Sierra most

371
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,800
of all I would like to mention that

372
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:42,850
everybody i believe understands that i

373
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,980
would like congratulate and thank mr.

374
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,899
chef college vice president of the

375
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,670
european commission for creating this

376
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,440
first network of the first successes

377
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,710
potentially creating probably much

378
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,059
higher and stronger success

379
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:59,100
of this very interesting very

380
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:02,250
comprehensive but very important I

381
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:05,399
believe project after successful visit

382
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:09,510
of French president Francois Hollande in

383
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:12,750
Beijing the first assessment are really

384
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,580
very positive these are be this future

385
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:19,350
Paris summit I would like to come to ask

386
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:21,480
you is it possible to present us the

387
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,520
most important contribution of European

388
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,950
Union to the final success of Paris Corp

389
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,460
summit and secondly if it's possible to

390
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:35,279
assess a little bit nowadays the level

391
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:40,830
of cooperation with China in energy

392
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:44,730
sector thank you thank you and the ear

393
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:49,350
place here at them thank you friendship

394
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:53,120
dr. avi Rafa I very much agree with the

395
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:56,789
idea of putting energy efficiency and

396
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,279
energy Union in one package and I agree

397
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:01,350
with them is the points that this is the

398
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,740
way to reconcile the emissions in these

399
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:06,779
areas and you mentioned the other

400
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,450
importance of the activities regarding

401
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:12,120
the buildings I have two very

402
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:17,039
down-to-earth questions related to that

403
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:20,279
first how you plan to motivate energy

404
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,799
companies from oligopolies down to the

405
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:25,580
district heating companies to be more

406
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:29,000
involved in the energy efficiencies

407
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,529
market and to increase their energy

408
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,409
efficiency sales at the expense of the

409
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:38,909
energy cells the second part of the

410
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:41,460
industry is arguing that by 2030 they

411
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:43,679
will be able to increase efficiency of

412
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,970
the simulated photosynthesis to the

413
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:50,820
level that allows commercialization do

414
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:55,679
you see real capacity and simulated

415
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:58,060
photosynthesis for a contributing work

416
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:03,730
to achieving our targets in

417
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:07,480
change thank you and the third question

418
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:10,000
there at the back and then we'll ask our

419
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,860
panelists thank you answer hi everybody

420
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,550
my name is Joe sivaji dive energy

421
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:17,199
analyst here in Slovakia I would like to

422
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,230
take a little bit on a North stream

423
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,760
because this is very very topical issue

424
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:25,240
here in this part of Europe and

425
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:29,230
everybody was speaking a bit about I

426
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,330
think the problem is that we made a

427
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:35,950
mistake in history in a part in the past

428
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:39,429
because there's already nerds 31 its

429
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:42,420
kind of precedent now buddy not even a

430
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:45,610
European Commission not German regulator

431
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:48,430
anytime analyzed it's a compliance with

432
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:53,169
the third energy package or even second

433
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:57,070
energy package why maybe because nobody

434
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:59,670
asked there is a possibility of any

435
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:03,550
member state to ask European Commission

436
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:05,980
to submit this question and to ask why

437
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:09,659
maybe Germany or any other country in

438
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:13,090
which territorial waters nor 31 is late

439
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:15,880
so if we want in some way to limit

440
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:18,250
notes3 more prevent North 32 we have to

441
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,550
return to the past and this in

442
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:24,520
compliance with the European energy law

443
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,800
so that maybe even question for and

444
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,170
maybe question to mr. structure which

445
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,450
why Commission haven't started yet this

446
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,490
kind of kind of analysis question

447
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:40,090
whether nordstrom one is complain

448
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:42,250
compliance with you lo SE said that we

449
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,280
can finish on a more optimistic know

450
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,970
that that not surprisingly mr. de

451
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:52,389
planning would like a little bit forgot

452
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:57,360
the first crisis but first first big

453
00:22:52,390 --> 00:23:00,640
crisis in 2009 in which I took part as a

454
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,740
president of European cancer had to

455
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,950
solve this crisis what was the main

456
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:10,380
reason of this crisis the main reason

457
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:14,910
was big resistance of Sweden pond

458
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:18,480
baltic countries against North 31 what

459
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:22,340
was the result of this crisis no string

460
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:26,640
one was during two years immediately

461
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:30,500
buildup of course it is not in

462
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:34,740
compliance is European rules of course

463
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,960
it is a destruction of chance to rules

464
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:41,940
and so on and we have to we have to come

465
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,940
back to base to basic rules and to

466
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:48,270
fulfill and to keep these rules it's

467
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:51,000
only way how to keep every discuss all

468
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:55,470
these days here in Tetris emit about how

469
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,630
to how to keep European Union how to how

470
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,060
to survive how to solve many many

471
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:04,890
challenges and problems we have to keep

472
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:07,470
rules and I am afraid that the north

473
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:12,540
wing the second will have some similar

474
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:15,630
similar scenario maybe not so strong as

475
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:18,120
in 2009 when I had to travel to key

476
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:20,400
Moscow and kief repeatedly and to

477
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:25,469
arrange some basic agreement between the

478
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:28,160
countries and we have to we have to

479
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:32,640
understand the history and understand

480
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:35,330
ambitions of superpower and empires and

481
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:40,100
the big big guys within the global

482
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:44,189
politics it's it's enough to to study

483
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:48,449
Russia Russia energy strategy from from

484
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:52,950
2003 updated in 2009 when it's all

485
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:56,640
written we have to control all routes

486
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:59,360
all pipelines going to Europe we have to

487
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,820
control sources of all in Central Asia

488
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,689
because we don't have in European part

489
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:10,980
of Russia some adequate sources we have

490
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:14,430
to diversify our export to to the south

491
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:16,710
and all these documents are are open and

492
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:21,300
we have to understand the effort of

493
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:24,710
Russia but I I understand this effort to

494
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:30,600
control our rules too

495
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:34,110
capacity to control price and to to to

496
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,439
keep this sphere of influence this

497
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:40,379
buffer zone around Russia under some

498
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,980
dependency it's your political problem

499
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,140
let me discuss about some some some not

500
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,169
so not so important topics but it is

501
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:53,850
very important to understand and the one

502
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:56,669
remark only more to this growing of

503
00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:02,158
renewable so see I am NOT against i'm

504
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:06,299
not against but two figures electricity

505
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:15,380
in the spot market was done by variable

506
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:19,379
cost is now 2965 29-point 65 euros the

507
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:23,070
concrete price on barrel for households

508
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,750
is more than hundred euros what also

509
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,928
gave us a difference between these

510
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:32,610
prices these subsidies to green energy

511
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:35,880
of course the fight against global

512
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:41,939
warming and climate changes will be

513
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:45,799
realized only when German public have

514
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:48,840
will have willingness to pay these bills

515
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:52,289
this day when the willingness will be

516
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,949
will be reduced this war will be

517
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:59,158
finished it's my prediction and these

518
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:01,260
figures are big big fear we big big

519
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,919
Warner for for everybody because

520
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:09,029
somebody has to pay this gap its twenty

521
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:11,940
nine euros it is impossible to build up

522
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:15,149
any convention source any convention

523
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:18,690
source we are discussing about

524
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:21,510
allowances it's totally stupid procedure

525
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:26,220
and rule because it's so simple so

526
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:30,120
simple solution carbon tax nobody is

527
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:32,490
willing to push through it why what's

528
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,559
the interest of these big players and

529
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,740
big guys

530
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,840
okay thank you probably this difference

531
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:42,960
between 30 and 100 is not just green

532
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,259
Jack's I mean there are quite a lot of

533
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,039
other components and various taxes that

534
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:54,929
are included in it but let's quickly

535
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:57,389
cover the other questions the how to get

536
00:27:54,929 --> 00:28:02,070
the energy companies interested in

537
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:03,959
energy efficiency who would like to mr.

538
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,730
colleague you were saying very

539
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,299
interesting finance innovation probably

540
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:12,389
that should go to you well I think the

541
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:14,700
incentives have to be driven by way then

542
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:16,590
to modernize and they do have to follow

543
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,629
and should follow the overall strategy

544
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:20,970
of the of the of the national energy

545
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:25,049
policy as well as European energy policy

546
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,690
hazard production by forty percent by to

547
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:30,149
some thirty in the European Union in

548
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,700
comparison to 1990 it's a goal which was

549
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:35,129
adopted the EU level also translated

550
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,980
into the National metal being in the

551
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:40,408
presidency of the EU in 2016 will push

552
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,940
for the accomplishment of this goal and

553
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:44,580
abilities is good for the people for the

554
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,409
nations for the ear for Europe so the

555
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,168
company should follow in this in the in

556
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:50,940
this direction second aspect is the push

557
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:53,970
from people themselves as was already

558
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:57,389
mentioned we do want to live in healthy

559
00:28:53,970 --> 00:29:00,090
environment and this is the way how how

560
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:03,748
people see it and feel it and the third

561
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:05,490
element is our financial instruments as

562
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:08,340
already mentioned in Slovakia we are

563
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,889
building we are building basically a

564
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,459
energy efficiency fund which will be

565
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:15,748
publicly supported but which will

566
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:18,950
basically the task will be to bring

567
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:22,379
private sector investors to push and

568
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:24,749
finance energy efficiency projects so we

569
00:29:22,379 --> 00:29:26,219
have to identify ways how financial

570
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:28,559
community can support this type of

571
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,899
movement and I think on the European

572
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,990
level but also national level we still

573
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:35,399
have a task how to structure the

574
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:37,320
regulations in in the way that would

575
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:40,110
encourage these companies to move in in

576
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,550
this direction so that they also conform

577
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:46,300
to the regulations

578
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:49,270
towards energy efficiency Minster was

579
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:52,300
saying I fully agree I this we should be

580
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:55,000
all games about permanent subsidies but

581
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:58,060
subsidies are subsidies are just for a

582
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,900
period for very focused thing Oh welcome

583
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:04,629
I have to say energetic so if we diverge

584
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:07,090
some of our resources in am and I know

585
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:09,550
very well that national budgets

586
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:12,370
especially in Europe are very much in it

587
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:15,490
in a complex situation but if we diverge

588
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:18,280
from one subsidy to another I think it's

589
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,170
fine if the final objective is good the

590
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:23,680
important thing is that subsidies cannot

591
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:25,990
be permanent subsidy just to maintain an

592
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,620
industry or something that doesn't work

593
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:32,830
it's pure folly but a subsidy to move

594
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,370
from one form of the energy market to

595
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:40,689
another I think it's welcome actually

596
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:44,199
well thank you and now we have a one

597
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:47,590
minute to cover China and Paris which I

598
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:52,570
guess should be enough miss searched so

599
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:55,750
first what is the future of the EU

600
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:59,879
energy relations with with China on EU

601
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:03,790
level and what we will bring to Paris

602
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:06,670
first I I think that Europe is bringing

603
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:09,280
the most ambitious contribution to

604
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,530
parties we made our so-called I indices

605
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,990
which is the the collective contribution

606
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:16,300
of the new member states early on just

607
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:19,450
to lead by example and motivate other

608
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,370
global players to follow our examples

609
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:25,320
forty percent reduction of our

610
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:27,159
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030

611
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,439
twenty-seven percent of energy

612
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:35,560
production from renewables twenty-seven

613
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:37,780
percent for energy efficiency and on top

614
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,899
of it we also were bringing some of the

615
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:44,500
schemes we developed in Europe we just

616
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:47,140
reform our ETS emission trading system

617
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,570
mechanism of adjusted it for not only

618
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,370
for post-2020 period but also through

619
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:55,020
the market stability reserve also for

620
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:57,270
the period until 2020 and I I have to

621
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,700
say that it's very positively viewed

622
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,530
also by our Chinese partners we are

623
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,200
helping them be the technical assistance

624
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:07,110
I was in the Quebec where they have

625
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,560
system which is very very similar to

626
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:13,580
what we have in Europe and they are

627
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,580
already in a

628
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:22,540
they say

629
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:30,730
