1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
if you start to see heads droop and

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,258
people nodding off but our topic I think

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,710
this afternoon ensures that none of you

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,750
is going to nod off I'm Paul Taylor I'm

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,570
the European affairs editor of Reuters

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,640
the international news agency and I

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,880
write the inside Europe column for the

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,710
International New York Times I'm also I

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,180
should declare an interest at this point

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:32,489
the grandson of a refugee my grandmother

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:37,019
and her family came from Lithuania to

12
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:40,730
Britain in the 1890s fleeing the pogroms

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,559
the persecution of the Jews nowadays

14
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:45,989
they might be considered to be rather

15
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,989
dodgy economic migrants rather than

16
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,769
genuine refugees but anyway that's by

17
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,468
the by let me do a little experiment

18
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,300
could you raise your hand if any member

19
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,789
of your family for the last three

20
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,709
generations was a refugee well I think

21
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,700
we have a blocking minority in this

22
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:13,740
conversation but not perhaps a qualified

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:16,560
majority the slower the Slovenian prime

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,089
minister morocha rawr who as the French

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
say doesn't have his tongue in his

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,460
pocket has said in the last couple of

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,320
weeks that the refugee crisis could lead

28
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:31,020
to the collapse of the European Union

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:34,649
and reignite the Balkan conflicts is he

30
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,560
right or is this hype well can Europe

31
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,850
turn this tragedy to take the subject

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,630
we've been asked to discuss this

33
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,350
afternoon and this chaos into an

34
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:49,408
opportunity for cooperation to discuss

35
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,449
the topic I'm joined by a tremendously

36
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:56,460
well qualified panel Mary Keaveney me to

37
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,460
my left deputy secretary-general of the

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,429
OECD and a former prime minister of

39
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,649
Finland who's the one member of the

40
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,200
panel who's sat regularly the european

41
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,270
council table and may be able to give us

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,209
a sense of those dynamics as well as

43
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,910
well as the economics of of migration

44
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,590
yan figo

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,660
needs no introduction in this country or

46
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,480
in this town but probably enjoys a good

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,450
introduction as much as anyone else vice

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,040
president of the National Council of the

49
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,350
Slovak Republic that's to say of

50
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,950
Parliament and chairman of the Christian

51
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,840
Democratic Movement the center-right

52
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:37,730
opposition in this country and a former

53
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,739
european commissioner and negotiator of

54
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,649
Slovakia's accession to the european

55
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:50,720
union and that was how I met him who

56
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:54,090
almost 20 years ago katarina matter nova

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,150
deputy director-general of something

58
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:02,400
which in that dreadful brussels speak is

59
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,870
called DG near better than DG far I'm

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,110
not sure it is it's just as in

61
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,840
comprehensive weather DG near as you

62
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,959
probably haven't guessed deals with the

63
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,590
countries that are next to us and which

64
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,709
are neighbors and or candidates to join

65
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,200
and her department is now the Department

66
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,320
for neighborhood and enlargement

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,440
negotiations and as you know enlargement

68
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:33,390
negotiations are two enlargement as to

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:36,269
military justice is to justice she's

70
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,399
also an expert on economic reform and

71
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:42,000
transition formally at the World Bank

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,630
and as an advisor to slovakia's reform

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,090
government in the late 90s and at the

74
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,690
far end of my distinguished panel is the

75
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,700
distinguished Liz collet who is director

76
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:56,220
of migration part of the migration

77
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,268
policy institute Europe based in

78
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,489
Brussels and she's an expert on the

79
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,370
issues of migration and the integration

80
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:09,060
of immigrants so I think we'll be asking

81
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:13,230
her a lot about how our societies deal

82
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,440
with the challenge today so in this

83
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,959
first round I'd like to look at the

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:22,079
humanitarian political social and

85
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,450
economic challenges that opposed by this

86
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,030
current wave of refugees and other

87
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,280
migrants I'm using those terms

88
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:33,150
Fugees and other migrants recognizing

89
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,638
that many perhaps most Liz will may be

90
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,760
able to tell us of those arriving on our

91
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,669
shores are refugees but there are also

92
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:44,400
others among them who are not recognized

93
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,039
as such as refugees and then we'll have

94
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,169
a chance to follow up on specific

95
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,270
questions and I'd like you in the

96
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,120
audience to have a chance not only to

97
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:58,859
send in questions which you can tweet

98
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:02,070
but also to hear your own voices when

99
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,200
you do have a question or a short

100
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,840
comment and I stress the short please

101
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,300
identify yourselves say to whom your

102
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,239
question or comment is addressed keep it

103
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:19,080
concise I will be distributing triple-a

104
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:21,750
ratings for short questions I would like

105
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,800
you also to exercise your democratic

106
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:30,300
rights and vote electronically and I

107
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,190
have two questions number one hour

108
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,570
question number two is up there at the

109
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:35,880
moment all right well let's start with

110
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:39,630
question and would do then should

111
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:43,110
religion and or ethnicity play any role

112
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:48,060
in determining which refugees European

113
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:50,370
countries except yes or no question

114
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,650
number one if anybody would is able to

115
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:59,010
put it up there no apparently not I look

116
00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:01,500
desperately at the controller's question

117
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:04,650
number one is should be you member

118
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,960
states be able to refuse to take in a

119
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:10,530
share of refugees determined by an

120
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:17,159
agreed EU formula for relocation yes or

121
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:20,940
no right all that done I'm going to ask

122
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,750
Mary Keaveney me first what does OECD

123
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,090
research tell us about the economic and

124
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,880
social trends associated with this

125
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,859
migration wave in Europe thank you very

126
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,680
much mr. chair for this opportunity and

127
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:38,250
good afternoon everybody I'm happy to

128
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,550
tell you some of the results of our

129
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,740
surveys and

130
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,890
show you or give you some facts and

131
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:48,220
figures but I think that after we have

132
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:51,610
all seen these flows of refugees

133
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:54,430
arriving on the shores of Europe and

134
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,440
walking through the Western Balkan we do

135
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,500
know that this is not a question of

136
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,920
figures and statistics it's about people

137
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,530
families and children but these images

138
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,960
which we have seen they can also kind of

139
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,780
give a little bit wrong impression when

140
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,799
we think about the whole theme of my

141
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:19,239
creation namely most of people entering

142
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,920
Europe do so through legal channels in

143
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,140
our recently published oec the

144
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,810
international migration outlook we

145
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,979
estimated that 4.3 million permanent

146
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:34,030
legal immigrants settled in the OECD in

147
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:36,190
2014 including 2 million in Europe only

148
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,200
a small fraction of them were refugees

149
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,130
but of course when we look at the

150
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:46,780
figures of this year this is a huge

151
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:49,680
amount in 2014 the number of new asylum

152
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:52,539
seekers in OECD countries exceeded

153
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,480
800,000 for the first time since the

154
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,790
beginning of the 1990s and then

155
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,430
humanitarian migration crisis that

156
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:02,890
Europe is experiences is unprecedented

157
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:07,540
with already an appalling and

158
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:10,750
unacceptable human cost this year 2015

159
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,880
will be historic is probably more than 1

160
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,750
million asylum applications registered

161
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,150
and this number may be up to 400 450

162
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:23,560
thousands people who will be granted

163
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:26,020
refugee stages the diversity of the

164
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,690
population flow and the fact that OECD

165
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,950
countries are affected unevenly poses

166
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,960
also our problems and we all know that

167
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,730
austria-hungary and Sweden are receiving

168
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:41,080
the largest number of international

169
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:43,510
migrants per capita and we also noted

170
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,930
crisis will probably last for a long

171
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:49,450
time given the complexity of stabilizing

172
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,270
the situation in Libya and Syria and

173
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,390
this contributes to folder anxiety in

174
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,850
public opinion

175
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:57,920
many European countries including those

176
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:02,510
which are not necessarily at the

177
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,180
forefront of the crisis the

178
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,160
re-introduction of border controls and

179
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,890
the construction of fences may buy time

180
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,560
for overstretched countries but no one

181
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:16,100
can seriously expect to keep out people

182
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,520
who are so desperate to move furthermore

183
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:22,910
it's very clear that no country can on

184
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,819
its own handle such a crisis Germany as

185
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,010
a preferred destination country is this

186
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,410
year expected to receive a much greater

187
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:34,460
number of assalam claimants as compared

188
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:38,260
to 2014 and what is needed in order to

189
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:41,740
address this crisis it is both

190
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,150
coordinated and global policy response

191
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,820
when you think about immediate policy

192
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,490
responses they have to deal with saving

193
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,520
lives at sea providing emergency support

194
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,750
refugees and asylum-seekers reinforcing

195
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,100
border controls and improving

196
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,670
coordination and burden sharing

197
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,950
mechanisms within the EU and these now

198
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,110
need to be complemented by other actions

199
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:07,010
more focused on medium and longer term

200
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:09,740
issues first we need to better

201
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,900
anticipate possible future developments

202
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,790
as migrants and smuggling networks

203
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,090
constantly add up their roots and

204
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,339
strategies secondly we need to step up

205
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,290
our efforts to fight against human

206
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,200
smuggling in cooperation with countries

207
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,030
of transits and this is of course one of

208
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,610
the objectives of the recently accurate

209
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:31,970
action plan between the European Union

210
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:34,010
and Turkey and thirdly we need to start

211
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,040
rebuilding trust in migration policies

212
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:40,010
in institutions at national and EU level

213
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,709
and what is need is is comprehensive and

214
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,580
well tailored policies when it comes to

215
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:50,590
integrations of immigrants what about

216
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:53,360
then the costs of this whole phenomena

217
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,360
the work of the OECD shows that

218
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,150
migration generally plays a positive

219
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,520
role in the economy the evidence

220
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,770
accumulated across a wide range of OECD

221
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,800
countries suggests that immigrants tend

222
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,220
to pay more in taxes and Social Security

223
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
country

224
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,519
reasons than they receive in individual

225
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,529
benefits this choice of destination

226
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,069
countries including for refugees

227
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:21,199
arriving today is not based on the

228
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:24,949
generosity of the social security

229
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:26,930
systems in the context of aging

230
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:29,329
populations the supply of labor and

231
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:33,138
skills related to the influx of migrants

232
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:37,399
can actually be an asset if integrations

233
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:40,639
into the labor market is far fast and

234
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:45,079
the integration of refugees will involve

235
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:47,870
costs up front costs costs up front but

236
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,930
if properly be designed will also yield

237
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:54,079
high benefits but the integration really

238
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:57,500
is the key it's a cornerstone of any

239
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,019
positive migration story in July

240
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,230
released a new report under the title

241
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:06,019
settling in indicators of immigrant

242
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,509
integration and that provides a first

243
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:10,939
broad international comparison across

244
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:13,370
all EU and OECD countries of the

245
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:15,829
economic and social outcomes of

246
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,430
immigrants and their children in host

247
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:22,819
countries and a key result of this work

248
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:26,149
is that immigrants have lower outcomes

249
00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:30,050
than the native born in many areas like

250
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:33,319
income inequality and employment but

251
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,219
they are not always very big the

252
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:39,229
differences between native born

253
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,790
specifically it is at the top end of the

254
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,709
qualification scale where the

255
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,990
differences in integration outcomes

256
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:48,050
between immigrants at a native bone are

257
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:52,009
most pronounced so higher education

258
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:57,589
protects foreign born less well than her

259
00:12:52,009 --> 00:13:01,250
native born against disadvantage so this

260
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:04,250
tells us that in many countries work

261
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,680
remains to be done to enable immigrants

262
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:10,850
and their children the opportunities to

263
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:13,550
succeed in life but if microns integrate

264
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,130
well and international cooperation is

265
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:18,670
enhanced the benefits of international

266
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:22,810
migration can be much greater than

267
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:24,610
the risks since 1972 at the OECD we have

268
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,010
done a lot of Esav evidence based

269
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,620
analysis of my creation policy

270
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:33,840
challenges and we also are ready to help

271
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:37,120
the European Union in this acute crisis

272
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,860
which has to be solved of course among

273
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,810
the European countries but when it comes

274
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,540
to especially in the creation policies I

275
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,329
think we have their role to be played in

276
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,839
order to share the best practices and

277
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:52,930
show which policies work at the most

278
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,150
effective way so thank you for for the

279
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,400
attention for this possibility to set

280
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,920
the scene just one question before I

281
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,220
move on is there anything you can tell

282
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,550
us about the sort of leads and lags in

283
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,910
other words how many years of cost is

284
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:12,160
there before the benefits start to come

285
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,410
through for the economy because that

286
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,380
obviously is important for politicians

287
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,569
seeking reelection unfortunately we

288
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,939
don't have that kind of figures or

289
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:25,530
estimates how many years it takes but we

290
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:29,740
know that it take it takes years for

291
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:33,819
before the foreign porn have integrated

292
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:37,000
or well into the society so you have to

293
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:40,000
kind of count off for ten years before

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,130
you are there and even some generations

295
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:49,210
but of course it depends very much on

296
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:51,310
the skills of refugees or immigrants how

297
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,920
much kind of extra effort is needed when

298
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:57,869
it comes to for example or to education

299
00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:02,199
okay thank you for that introduction

300
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:04,830
katarina matter Nova it can start by

301
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,150
telling us what is the European

302
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:10,230
Commission and European Union done so

303
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:12,520
far to cope with this wave of arrivals

304
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:15,540
and how much of what you've been

305
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,100
promised has actually been delivered

306
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,719
what we have been promised or what we

307
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,460
promised what what you've promised

308
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,830
yourselves and what others are promised

309
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,810
to you member states wait thank you very

310
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,910
much for the question and thank you very

311
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:31,660
much to the organizers for having

312
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:33,040
invited me just two small statements I

313
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,519
am a migrant and my

314
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,040
grandfather was a refugee and the second

315
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,769
one I represent the European Commission

316
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,300
not the EU as a whole which will become

317
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:50,019
apparent why I'm making this statement

318
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:52,329
in the at the beginning a lot has been

319
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,519
promised a lot has been delivered a lot

320
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:59,410
still needs to be needs to be delivered

321
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:01,660
I think that the magnitude of the

322
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,730
challenge and I choose to speak about it

323
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:07,259
as another problem but a challenge to

324
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:11,079
manage rather than a problem to solve

325
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:13,420
has been around for several month there

326
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,120
been you know the EU likes to do things

327
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,519
through through summits and processes

328
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:24,190
and meetings etc so a number of those

329
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:25,509
have been held and the U has first of

330
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,500
all together with the Member States

331
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:33,180
legislated and agreed on a number of

332
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,310
measures including the very unpopular

333
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,800
resettlement a relocation sorry scheme

334
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:42,579
but in addition to that there's been a

335
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:44,920
very sharp increase an expansion of the

336
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:48,310
on demand date and work of the EU

337
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:52,560
agencies whether it's frontex or or a

338
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:56,768
also which are the border management

339
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:59,109
agencies and there has been much stepped

340
00:16:56,769 --> 00:17:01,959
up cooperation with our neighbors that

341
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,299
the those countries that our department

342
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:07,359
works with because we happen to have

343
00:17:04,299 --> 00:17:09,609
both the sources of migrant sources of

344
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,490
refugees in the transit countries in our

345
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:16,479
portfolio so we have worked very closely

346
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:20,079
with Lebanon and Jordan that are by the

347
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,230
way shouldering a large chunk of Syrian

348
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,879
migrants just for comparison sake inland

349
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,089
Jordan is about ten percent of the

350
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,190
population in Syrian migrants represent

351
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:33,370
a third of the population together with

352
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,679
Palestinians of Lebanon that's as if the

353
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,209
entire Mexico moved to the United States

354
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,940
just to give you an order of magnitude

355
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:42,220
and also work with the Western Balkan

356
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:46,240
countries to help them

357
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,549
help them manage the the flows manage

358
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,130
the migration part of it and address

359
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:54,850
both the humanitarian and the more more

360
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,730
medium-term aspects and I think that as

361
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,709
you said before it's really there are

362
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,419
two things that need to happen one is

363
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,330
the humanitarian response to the

364
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:07,539
immediate crisis and then work with the

365
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,000
host communities on on enabling and

366
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:12,010
facilitating integration which is a more

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,929
long-term issue and that's something

368
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,830
that we are in active dialogue with

369
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:19,900
Turkey for example through a migration

370
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,439
action plan that has been developed and

371
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,980
and that has been agreed and is now

372
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,309
waiting the post-election processes to

373
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:33,340
kick in to be able to to finalize it at

374
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:37,500
the political level and then last but

375
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:42,129
not least there has been a significant

376
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,880
financial effort by the EU let's not

377
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:48,130
forget the EU budget is one percent of

378
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,919
European Union G&I so we are dealing

379
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:54,520
with a very small chunk of what EU

380
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:59,980
member states have its disposal and the

381
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:03,190
EU has put together financing packages

382
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:06,490
both for the UN agencies like UNHCR the

383
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:09,580
World Food Programme financing for the

384
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:12,400
EU agencies or developing even

385
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:16,559
innovative European Union trust funds to

386
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:20,380
support the medium-term kind of

387
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,870
investments that's the Syrian trust fund

388
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,299
which also the Slovak Republic

389
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:28,418
contributed the EU has put so far half a

390
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:30,549
billion into it member states in total

391
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:32,530
50 million but there is there is an

392
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,389
expectation that a lot more would be

393
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:37,629
done by on the side of the Member States

394
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:40,330
and the same goes for for a similar

395
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:45,490
trust fund to help with the sub-saharan

396
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:48,699
Africa medium-term longer-term migration

397
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:52,000
pressures so-called Sahel trust fund

398
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,770
where do you put together 1.8 billion

399
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,860
and again the expectation is that

400
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,790
there's going to be

401
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:01,280
major matching by member states you talk

402
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,620
about expectations but isn't it the case

403
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,420
that member states come to Brussels and

404
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,080
they promised these things extra

405
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,360
resources for Frontex the Border Agency

406
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,500
I think the other one that you mentioned

407
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,139
was a ah so which is the asylum Support

408
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:21,530
Agency which I believe had 50 staff

409
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,000
before the beginning of the crisis you

410
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,670
know these are these are drops in the

411
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,790
bucket and they are they are the Member

412
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:32,299
States actually stepping up and doing

413
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:35,240
what they promised to do i think that

414
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:38,330
the picture is little varied i think

415
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:41,000
that member states have started stepping

416
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:44,240
up but the stepping up is not in step

417
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,580
with the expectations so far and i think

418
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,740
that's one of the reasons why for the

419
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,750
week after next week is a summit in

420
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:54,140
Valletta which will be discussing more

421
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:56,000
the african migration trends and and

422
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,220
where the big announce table will be the

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,250
you trust fund and the week after i

424
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:04,299
believe that a new summit of EU leaders

425
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:07,070
has been has been called to remind

426
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:08,900
member states of the pledges that have

427
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,409
been made both in terms of personnel and

428
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,600
in terms of financial support so what's

429
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,850
the most urgent thing you need now and

430
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,449
what do you do about the tens of

431
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:23,270
thousands of people who are on the roads

432
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:27,679
in the Western Balkans and Greece in

433
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:30,889
Austria and being pushed from pillar to

434
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,770
post well I think there are several

435
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:36,740
issues that are urgent right now one is

436
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:39,230
the human humanitarian support first of

437
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,270
all and with the approaching winter to

438
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,660
make sure that people don't that we

439
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:47,900
don't have losses of lives and the

440
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:51,230
humanitarian machine is is working but

441
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,630
it's still not foolproof I mean there

442
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,730
are still there is still a danger that

443
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:59,480
that people will get stuck and people

444
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,179
will will potentially freeze it etc so

445
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,820
first of all the humanitarian assistance

446
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:06,010
needs to needs to be delivered in real

447
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:11,290
time and in

448
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:14,290
sufficient sufficient quantity second I

449
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,020
think that there is very much a need to

450
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:21,250
to stabilize the situation on the you

451
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:25,410
external borders and and start managing

452
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:28,270
the flow in a way that that would not be

453
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:31,990
overwhelming the transit countries and

454
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:36,940
and third there is indeed the need for a

455
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:39,220
pan-european solution to to have a final

456
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,830
destination for four people and I think

457
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:46,990
that some sort of burden sharing is

458
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:49,870
certainly part of that yeah um Liz color

459
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,330
if I can come to you what's the you

460
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,229
doing right what's it doing wrong in

461
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,520
coping with this crisis so far well if

462
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,020
you don't want to ask anyone else any

463
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,610
more questions I can take the next hour

464
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:06,460
do that and I think first it's important

465
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,590
to recognize that two things one this is

466
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,690
not a new phenomenon the phenomenon of

467
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:13,120
mixed flows arriving to the European

468
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,800
Union Union particularly through means

469
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,270
of maritime migration at different

470
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,500
points across the Mediterranean is not

471
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:23,850
new it's been going on for several

472
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:26,650
decades what is made it acute is the

473
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:29,139
escalation of a global refugee crisis

474
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,900
that now sees more than 60 million

475
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:33,940
people displaced worldwide the second

476
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,460
thing to really understand is there is

477
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,560
nothing unanticipated about the current

478
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,240
crisis that we're seeing now along the

479
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,250
western borden border everyone is

480
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,590
expressing surprise and we're having

481
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,180
some it after summit this time last year

482
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,340
I used to commiserate with poor

483
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,600
financial unless you had to spend every

484
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:54,520
Sunday at a summit and now they

485
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,439
commiserate with me but you know we

486
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,120
started working at mpi Europe on the

487
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,190
future the common European asylum system

488
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,409
more than two years ago because we saw

489
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,970
this moment coming and I think most

490
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,830
senior officials in many countries

491
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,720
across the EU also saw this moment

492
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,000
coming so the question we have to ask

493
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,340
ourselves is is not do we need better

494
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,050
crisis management tools or Crisis

495
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,300
Response tools but how do we actually

496
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:18,190
kick them into action two years before

497
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,389
the crisis happens rather than three

498
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,849
months after

499
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:23,998
and so one of the major shortcomings and

500
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:28,208
I think it's too short coming that

501
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:30,940
resonates throughout policies across the

502
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:33,909
EU spectrum is really why do we only

503
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,959
respond once it has become absolutely

504
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:39,429
critical it has become urgent to find a

505
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:42,309
solution in there is that recognition

506
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:44,919
but still we are in a situation where

507
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:47,229
there are 28 different solutions on the

508
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:49,299
table 28 different views about how this

509
00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:51,999
might ultimately be resolved and that

510
00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:53,529
lack of coherence when it heads of state

511
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:55,419
and when interior ministers and when

512
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:57,579
foreign ministers sit together is really

513
00:24:55,419 --> 00:25:00,879
impeding the ability to move forward in

514
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:02,349
a structured manner at some point there

515
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:05,228
has to be the recognition that there are

516
00:25:02,349 --> 00:25:07,239
no perfect solutions out there there are

517
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:09,579
no ideal solutions out there there is a

518
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:11,139
set of least worst options for the EU in

519
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:14,039
terms of managing this crisis and the

520
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:16,988
critical thing is to pick one and really

521
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,879
commit to it and that's hard in a

522
00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:21,070
context where the EU is not getting the

523
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:23,228
basics right and I think Katerina

524
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,689
highlighted that the urgent thing is to

525
00:25:23,229 --> 00:25:28,209
really deal with the humanitarian the

526
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,769
immediate humanitarian situation the

527
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:31,629
fact that people are still arriving on

528
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:34,389
the Greek islands and not being looked

529
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:36,070
after properly after four or five months

530
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:37,809
of this escalation in numbers is

531
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,908
something we should be ashamed of and

532
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:42,039
really thinking about and asking why

533
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:43,809
that's not happening and part of that is

534
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,609
because it's one thing to allocate

535
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,709
emergency funding it's another thing to

536
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:49,689
translate that into operational

537
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:51,309
resources on the ground and if we've

538
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,409
learned anything from the EU in the last

539
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:55,149
few months it's that when there are

540
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:57,459
funds available it turns out to be very

541
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:59,109
very hard to translate them through

542
00:25:57,459 --> 00:26:00,849
national administration's through local

543
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:02,349
administrations to get resources on the

544
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:04,269
ground so you have to rethink that

545
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:06,279
things like the civil protection

546
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:08,559
mechanism that have been activated have

547
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:10,539
not been responded to in part because

548
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,279
many member states and many member

549
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:14,320
states who normally contribute to

550
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,570
emergency response are overwhelmed

551
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,668
themselves so we should really look at

552
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,408
that we need to move beyond crisis

553
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:22,929
management and look at the investment

554
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:24,729
issues writ large we've talked about the

555
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:27,249
difficulties in finding financing at

556
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:29,079
member state level we haven't even begun

557
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:31,359
to think about the financial

558
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:32,830
implications of this from the point of

559
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,139
view of building capacity

560
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,000
an asylum systems building protection

561
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,789
capacity in the regions of origin and

562
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,529
also thinking about how to invest in

563
00:26:39,789 --> 00:26:43,269
public services and integration in the

564
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:45,549
long term for those people already in

565
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,019
the European Union we are at the wrong

566
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:49,570
order of magnitude right now with

567
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:51,159
investments but finally I think one of

568
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,990
the things the EU is going to have to do

569
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:54,580
in the next few years and this is

570
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:58,539
particularly difficult at a time of

571
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:02,168
crisis is to rethink the fundamentals of

572
00:26:58,539 --> 00:27:04,120
a common European asylum system that is

573
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:08,080
neither common nor functioning as

574
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:10,510
intended it is the dysfunction of an

575
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,850
incomplete half-built system whereby

576
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:15,399
there are 28 national Asylum systems

577
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:19,080
some of which we have capacity and some

578
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:21,969
do not Oh with an overarching a

579
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,529
commonality to them so we're going to

580
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,389
have to think very hard about whether we

581
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:27,669
want to move forward and complete that

582
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:29,590
sip system create a grand vision and

583
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:33,010
work towards that in a concrete way or

584
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,720
move backwards and give up Schengen give

585
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:37,210
up our common policies in this area and

586
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,730
regress to where we were before the area

587
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,639
of free movement was built unfortunately

588
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,940
that the costs of the regression are

589
00:27:42,639 --> 00:27:48,010
extremely high not least in the terms of

590
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,929
rebuilding border infrastructure but the

591
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,879
political will for completing new

592
00:27:49,929 --> 00:27:54,730
systems is extremely low and i think we

593
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:57,460
sit in that middle point and we risk

594
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,230
paralysis by not choosing one direction

595
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,380
on the other but sitting and doing

596
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,510
crisis management that's very much i

597
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,070
think that the state of the european

598
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:08,440
union in general you could be equally

599
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,658
applied to the eurozone which blighted

600
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,980
so many of my weekends before the

601
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:17,559
migration crisis replaced it thank you

602
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:21,490
for that a couple of specific questions

603
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:24,250
is it realistic to for the European

604
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:26,649
Union as some people have suggested to

605
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,610
create hot spots on other countries

606
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:33,840
territory and process try and process

607
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:37,669
asylum seekers before they enter the EU

608
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,990
for example in Turkey or

609
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,460
somewhere safe in North Africa or if

610
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,150
there were somewhere safe in North

611
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:46,860
Africa so I thinking until the hot spots

612
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,750
concept becomes fully operational within

613
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,879
the EU it may be premature to think

614
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,000
about it operating outside the European

615
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,860
Union the idea of processing claims

616
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,990
outside the EU is not a new one and

617
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:01,110
there are various ways to consider it

618
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,580
the one that would be most easy for the

619
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:04,559
European Union to contemplate is

620
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,929
enhancing the scale of resettlement

621
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,700
towards the European Union in the hope

622
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:10,470
that by resettling large numbers of

623
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,960
people in a managed way towards the

624
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:16,290
European Union from regions of crisis

625
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,090
you may be able to change the

626
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:20,670
decision-making process that people take

627
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,770
to use the services of smugglers and

628
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,059
take dangerous journeys the problem with

629
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,950
that is it's fraught with uncertainty

630
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:28,649
how many people would you need to

631
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,960
resettle from where and in order to

632
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:33,840
change that decision-making process some

633
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,880
of the more specific ideas are indeed so

634
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,159
the creation of hot spots creation of

635
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,390
external reception centers thinking

636
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,450
through different ways through which

637
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:44,760
people can access legal processes the

638
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,520
key thing for the EU to get a little bit

639
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,160
technical is you have to disconnect the

640
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,860
standards and laws within the EU from

641
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,170
any external processing if you created

642
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,178
an EU adjudication in a third country

643
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,830
you would first have to decide whose

644
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,510
standards would you use which use

645
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,129
germany standards or would you use

646
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:05,490
Bulgaria's standards which would have

647
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:07,920
very different recognition rates on what

648
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,929
basis would you determine that someone

649
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,429
was eligible and therefore where they

650
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:14,550
where were they would go within the

651
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:15,990
European Union um what would you do with

652
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,879
the people who were turned out not to be

653
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,740
eligible would you be creating

654
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,270
effectively a pool of people ineligible

655
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,070
for protection within the European Union

656
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:26,250
who would reside in that third country

657
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:28,379
and the enormous question which which

658
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,210
you know we're seeing in negotiations

659
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,350
with Turkey is what country would be

660
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,809
willing to take on this responsibility

661
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,760
on the e use behalf so there are a

662
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:39,030
number of legal technical and practical

663
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,550
issues with external processing in this

664
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,290
more complex sense but it's certainly an

665
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,190
issue that's that's rising up the agenda

666
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,139
and people are trying to think of

667
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:48,360
innovative ways to break this link

668
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,310
between territorial access to asylum and

669
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,240
and how to manage protection

670
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:56,100
Jeff Jeff all that with all these with

671
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,100
all these caveats and these dangers and

672
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:01,199
practical difficulties there is an

673
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,409
attempt to work both with the western

674
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,810
welcome partners and with Turkey on

675
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:10,340
developing at least partially a capacity

676
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:14,070
of screening and the the first level

677
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:16,220
adjudication okay a lot of those issues

678
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:21,120
that you raised which are intriguing and

679
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:25,170
complex fraud issues obviously apply to

680
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,169
it at any attempt to screen refugees at

681
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:30,120
hot spots within the EU as well whether

682
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,520
they're it's on Turkish soil aura on

683
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,280
greek soil the same question is do you

684
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:38,670
have some common definition of refugee

685
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:42,480
could refugee dumb that you apply and if

686
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:45,150
so whose standards do you apply and one

687
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,700
of the questions in my mind is can you

688
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:54,030
legally and ethically but first of all

689
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:56,970
legally detain refugees asylum seekers

690
00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:00,870
while their claims are processed in a

691
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:04,020
hot spot on lesbos or somewhere else in

692
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,580
Greece well the short answer is there

693
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,440
are very strict limitations on the

694
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,360
detention of asylum seekers and very

695
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,010
strict rules on on when you can use

696
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:17,100
detention it during an asylum procedure

697
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:19,530
the geographical advantage of the Greek

698
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:23,280
islands land producer in Sicily is that

699
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:24,990
they are in some ways they automatically

700
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:28,050
they are entirely surrounded by water

701
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,700
indeed so they are automatically you

702
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,169
know a form of detention in it and I

703
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,340
think you know as we've seen on the

704
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,320
Greek islands there's a limit to that

705
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,300
because really there's a capacity issue

706
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,159
in terms of the number of arrivals and

707
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,020
the conditions that people are housed in

708
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,290
it's easier to contemplate perhaps in

709
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,120
somewhere like Sicily and but that this

710
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:48,230
does bring you to you what is the

711
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,000
crucial point right now and the crucial

712
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:54,030
challenge for policymakers which is

713
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,700
reconciling the fact that we want to see

714
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:58,590
orderly managed systems of immigration

715
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,450
and asylum because that's how public

716
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,320
confidence is maintained is the sense

717
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:05,259
that we have control over this chaos

718
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,850
we manage these things versus the fact

719
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:08,980
that the large numbers of people

720
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,330
arriving on the Greek islands have very

721
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,549
different ideas about where they might

722
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,889
want to be within the European Union and

723
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:17,529
are expressing that with their feet on a

724
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:19,360
daily basis and we haven't yet come to

725
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,919
terms with what it would take and how

726
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,769
you would persuade those people because

727
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:27,130
I think as we've her you know building

728
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:29,440
walls is only a short-term solution how

729
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,330
do you create the conditions that might

730
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,789
change those decision-making processes

731
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:36,428
and perhaps slow down this flow which is

732
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:38,049
you know I I would love to say happy on

733
00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:39,100
well we've come to the politics of it

734
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:43,809
and therefore it's right that we should

735
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:45,370
turn to you young figure we heard this

736
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:48,220
morning at the panel which you weren't

737
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:53,439
able to attend that people saying that

738
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:56,320
this really could pose a real threat to

739
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,500
the breakup of the EU and of Schengen

740
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,889
although the consensus I think of all

741
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,259
present on the panel's was that the you

742
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:08,139
would muddle through or find some

743
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:11,889
greater some closer form of integration

744
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:13,990
that would deal with it in your mind how

745
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:17,669
do we prevent this refugee crisis from

746
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:20,319
breaking up the EU and the Schengen zone

747
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:23,020
thank you Paul for mother only giving me

748
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:26,529
the question but opportunity to to be

749
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:28,960
again together maybe part of the answer

750
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:32,230
to the question future of Europe or

751
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,050
breaking amber sticking on staying

752
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:38,469
together is question enhance or answer

753
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:42,040
in the hands of UK people you know what

754
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:43,918
I mean breaks it yes or no secondly I'm

755
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,960
happy to be here and thanks to any

756
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,609
invitation and our organizers to give me

757
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,730
the place in the panel where we are in

758
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:54,989
minority because previous was a problem

759
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:57,550
but now more seriously European Union is

760
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:59,669
frequently mentioned and defined as a

761
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:03,880
moving target or something which is

762
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:08,380
unfinished construction and I think that

763
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:11,890
this motion or evolution speaks by

764
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:15,040
itself it can go up or down from crisis

765
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,680
to crisis and from each crisis we may go

766
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,410
up

767
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,660
more mature more experienced but a

768
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,779
prepared for future or to the deeper

769
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:27,020
crisis or even even collapse or demise

770
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:29,630
or division history is full of lessons

771
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:32,329
and this is human construction so and

772
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:34,579
political it may collapse if we don't

773
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:37,670
care or if we don't do what is

774
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:43,819
appropriate and positive or constructive

775
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:45,859
for future I was in the in the first and

776
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:50,029
lodged commission or first with Brody

777
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:53,950
and then barossa and we faced very steep

778
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:57,559
and tough time of constitutional crisis

779
00:35:53,950 --> 00:36:01,879
after enlargement founding country said

780
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:05,630
no no in France and in Netherlands and

781
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:11,119
it was quite tough and it the messages

782
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:15,710
about periphery and the core directorio

783
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:20,180
and these temptations of artificial

784
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:22,040
divisions or mistrust overcome and I'm

785
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,680
happy to say it because this is example

786
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,940
this is proof that we may answer the

787
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:32,598
problem right and together not only some

788
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:35,750
and that's the time we need again then

789
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:42,260
we faced economic crisis the deepest

790
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:45,079
scenes war time it's over and from the

791
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,329
previous part we have a Lisbon Treaty

792
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:52,579
instead of constitutional treaty system

793
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:55,309
of 22 basic treaties then of course it's

794
00:36:52,579 --> 00:37:01,329
not ideal time but we adopted more

795
00:36:55,309 --> 00:37:04,569
strict and readable policy on budgetary

796
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:07,670
responsibility of states member states

797
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:11,808
this is also linked to another crisis

798
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:14,450
which is very vital in my case or real

799
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,700
because our government in Slovakia

800
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:19,359
previous government

801
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:22,149
on European firewall first time in short

802
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,119
history of European integration of this

803
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:28,060
country government fall apart on

804
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,570
European agenda not nitty-gritty

805
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:34,930
domestic but firewall for stability and

806
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:37,599
credibility of Euro our currency we got

807
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:42,430
hero in our pockets it's it's serious

808
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,810
and we pay the price for stability of

809
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:47,279
Euro which is important it's our

810
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:49,509
currency and I think that this crisis

811
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,200
together with the constitutional is

812
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:54,910
another good example because after

813
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,980
constitutional crisis we have more

814
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:59,560
members in the union yeah then we had

815
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,550
any time before it enlarged again and

816
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:06,310
again after euro crisis we have more

817
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:10,390
members of eurozone than any time before

818
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:14,560
it got it went up so this is my answer

819
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:19,810
to current crisis agenus Reba optimist

820
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,000
knee pessimist mr. Rizzoli this is a

821
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:25,210
message from Germany I am neither

822
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,329
optimist not neither nor nor pessimist

823
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,359
but I stay committed to the Future

824
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:34,180
determine it was it determined I

825
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:36,880
dispatcher incident feelings or sympathy

826
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:40,598
or something less tangible than

827
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:44,619
commitment for going on implementing

828
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:47,260
rules which we adopted if we fail in in

829
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:50,349
observance of our own rules in eurozone

830
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:53,560
or in migration policy Schengen or

831
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:57,339
dublin how come and what what what shall

832
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:00,490
we do more so I think we have to go back

833
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:03,578
to the rules to obey the rules we adopt

834
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:07,868
it to adapt them if needed and of course

835
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:10,750
do our best in on the continent in the

836
00:39:07,869 --> 00:39:13,390
territories around I think we spoke very

837
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:16,630
little in this previous minutes on on

838
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:19,210
roots of crisis how it happened why

839
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:22,690
there is such inflow to the continent

840
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:25,720
and I think there are many many points

841
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:28,300
to mention and there is a lot to do so I

842
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,160
don't want to dwell on my my experience

843
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,289
but

844
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,589
just 10 last year's speaks by itself

845
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:38,499
that enlarged union is more European is

846
00:39:35,589 --> 00:39:42,940
more complete I don't think that

847
00:39:38,499 --> 00:39:44,649
Slovakia is a reason for problems of

848
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,660
course we probably will speak about

849
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:50,950
situations or responses of central

850
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:55,299
Europeans but many countries didn't

851
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:58,269
observe Schengen rules at least within

852
00:39:55,299 --> 00:40:00,788
the last year or years and we need to

853
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:03,098
get back to the principle of the union a

854
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:06,539
rule of law can you can you go back to

855
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:10,900
rules that manifestly have broken down

856
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:12,969
and don't work began because and they

857
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,789
don't work not because of ill will but

858
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:18,430
because they are overwhelmed by events

859
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:22,059
I'm thinking of the Dublin rules which

860
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:26,038
Sandra ghazi declared to be dead on the

861
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:30,369
previous panel they would require Italy

862
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:34,539
and Greece to to detain and register on

863
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:37,539
their soil all of the more than half a

864
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:40,930
million what are we up to 800,000 people

865
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:43,749
who've arrived is it fair to expect them

866
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:45,879
to carry that burden when the rest of

867
00:40:43,749 --> 00:40:47,890
the European Union sits tight and people

868
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:50,559
like Mark the country that I know best

869
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:53,618
say although we were we we've opted out

870
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:55,479
of this so we will you know you sort it

871
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:58,420
out for yourselves I mean is that

872
00:40:55,479 --> 00:41:05,098
realistic and I know it's too much a

873
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:08,140
short time but the humanitarian Geneva

874
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:11,640
law and contracts and of course our

875
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:14,140
Schengen system has has its rules and

876
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,828
when when these rules by many countries

877
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:19,719
haven't been observed then we got into

878
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:22,839
very difficult sometimes chaotic

879
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:25,059
situation secondly we have been

880
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:30,430
observing for years at least last four

881
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:32,170
years since 2011 outbreak of conflicts

882
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,169
and war

883
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,960
middle east countries I think it was a

884
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:42,660
very long and important time to act not

885
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:47,980
only 22 more more more less observe and

886
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:50,500
if we only observe or don't act

887
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:54,910
prudently and swiftly then we pay much

888
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:57,640
higher price for the impact or fruits of

889
00:41:54,910 --> 00:42:00,520
such conflicts and that's that's the

890
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,460
case after outbreak of conflicts in

891
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:07,839
Middle East since 2011 or even sooner in

892
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:12,250
some countries like Iraq or in African

893
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:15,339
continent so now I I wouldn't like and I

894
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:18,910
wouldn't dwell on naming blaming shaming

895
00:42:15,339 --> 00:42:20,920
but rather returning to the principles

896
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,990
and points important for each country

897
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:27,369
and of course for a whole Europe as

898
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:29,200
community because if not then these

899
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:33,609
crises will be not only long but very

900
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:37,419
deep and will will impact our political

901
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:39,430
credibility and Trust well let's let's

902
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,430
not deny ourselves the fun of a bit of

903
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,410
naming and shaming to start off with um

904
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:48,970
why our Central European countries so

905
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:51,210
reluctant to share the burden it's from

906
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:51,209
yes
