1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,980
you

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,940
you

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,000
you

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,000
you

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,980
you

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,980
you

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,520
you

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,970
you

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,500
you

10
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,980
you

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,500
you

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,980
you

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,970
you

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,990
you

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:11,179
we said as

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:16,630
product today you may you might have

17
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:20,150
some kind of emblem on it but you have

18
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:25,310
like an Indian system mounted on on a

19
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:28,460
German car if you're driving a GM SUV

20
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:33,560
the four-wheel drive comes from us as a

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:35,530
company so you know I think we need to

22
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,620
sort of open these horizons a little

23
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:41,450
rather than you know everything at

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,800
compartmentalization because if we are

25
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,930
going to be silos in the industry I I

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:54,020
daimler and Ford are collaborating with

27
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,850
technologies or fuel cells you know they

28
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,589
actually have a company to get so

29
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,169
there's a lot which is happening which

30
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,530
is dismantling barriers so I just

31
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,690
challenge this point of view I'm not

32
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,280
talking about a new petition at least

33
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,389
and that was a question I have to think

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:18,440
about is how can we keep production and

35
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:22,010
at the end wealth in Europe am I in my

36
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,770
imagination when we think about I stay

37
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,500
with my battery example when we are when

38
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,680
we could make it and our suppliers and

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,770
manufacturers are trying to do so to be

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,930
maybe a little bit in front and if we

41
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,730
could make it to produce them somewhere

42
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,190
in Europe wherever there would be of

43
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,500
course that would be part of the

44
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:45,160
competition and of course it could be

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,050
also and should be also possible that

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:51,380
non-european manufacturers having ecards

47
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,570
with those batteries we are relying not

48
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:56,989
on borders I mean this industry is

49
00:02:53,570 --> 00:03:00,380
completely globalized and i think it's

50
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:03,280
it's no way and it would not be a very

51
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,660
good idea to to draw that back somehow

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,310
mr. excellently I would like to support

53
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,130
my registered email

54
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,530
in this question because this is also a

55
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,000
question about the sources for batteries

56
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:17,270
for example where are the main sources

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,819
of lithium in the world my opinion I

58
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:23,090
think I heard that this Asia in South

59
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:25,910
Africa it means the source for a battery

60
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,590
production is not in here and one more

61
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,319
time we are in this point what is the

62
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,239
sustainability of the economics which

63
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,069
means the competitiveness of the

64
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,650
business has to be really sustainable

65
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:39,589
and has to continue to grow and this is

66
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:43,069
this fight against one more time this is

67
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:46,299
the question about the triad okay car is

68
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:49,399
the rigid global product you are right

69
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:51,950
then maybe some Indian products are in

70
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,170
in place placed in the cars ensure

71
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,450
public in Slovakia some Chinese products

72
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,819
are also placing these are real and

73
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,548
product which is contains some parts

74
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,700
from different regions but basis now we

75
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:06,680
are talking on about the European Union

76
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,079
competitiveness and this is the point

77
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,430
sometimes we say in Slovakia we are more

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,290
holy than Holly this famous regulations

79
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,680
when I to take into consideration the

80
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:21,978
whole co2 production around the world

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:26,150
and the big energy plants the energy

82
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:28,969
stations yeah they connect our cars in

83
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,280
the world is not the main one we know

84
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,960
about this all of us which means this is

85
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,059
a discussion about the competitiveness

86
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,888
and this is the thing about this and to

87
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,320
keep the European environment in very

88
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:41,810
healthy conditions on the other hand is

89
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,969
this a challenge which is good my Indian

90
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,310
friend Manjit Singh from DD he says

91
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:49,250
always there is no problem there is only

92
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,220
challenge and this is true nature and

93
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,850
therefore we have to start ready to make

94
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,760
some actions according to industry 4.0

95
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:02,810
but real this this is a big point for us

96
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,389
to be spoken about between associations

97
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,979
in the Indian Union one more time try to

98
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:13,389
protect not the market but protect the

99
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:15,340
brain sometimes a little bit that

100
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:18,940
basically

101
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,789
is the job of executives of German

102
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,280
automobile industry to protect their

103
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,500
business and to grow their business that

104
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,599
that's their job and if they are

105
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,090
challenged they need to figure out how

106
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,880
to deal with the challenge and is the

107
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,799
job of the government of Germany to mean

108
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,419
to make sure that how million people

109
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,600
don't lose the job so I don't view that

110
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:43,180
as a question about the borders our

111
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,949
political issue is just pragmatic issue

112
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,400
they have business which they have to

113
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:50,110
defend and grow and country has the

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,120
labor market which has two deafening

115
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:56,200
grow its it's simple like that I don't

116
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,410
view that political you're so right in

117
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:02,219
terms of the innovation if he saw it's

118
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,510
not the technology which is disruptive

119
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,850
it's the business model which is

120
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,740
integrating the technologies and putting

121
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,870
forth to the customer which is disrupted

122
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:14,110
I don't know how many of you guys know

123
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:18,400
this but I had the opportunity to visit

124
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:21,270
the assembly line of Tesla and the

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,659
battery size is that or double a size

126
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:28,270
it's that small which is building and

127
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,110
it's laid out seven thousand of them are

128
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:36,219
laid out on the base so that's that's

129
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:40,120
how he is thinking now it do you think a

130
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:44,889
block of battery or getting Elon Musk to

131
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:48,789
invest in in this geography of Europe is

132
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:52,870
is that a solution because neither the

133
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:55,419
capital has has today a color you know

134
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,870
dollar may be the one of the secure

135
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:02,020
currencies but to my mind the capital

136
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,950
will flow where there is a demand and

137
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:10,270
there is a business sense or a business

138
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:12,849
model which will produce an roi I mean

139
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,680
that's that's I am NOT talking the

140
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,150
political language you know there that's

141
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,639
totally different i am talking the

142
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:21,789
language of businesses which actually

143
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,390
contribute to value creation whether

144
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:27,169
it's even in the in the economy or to

145
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,180
the jobs

146
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,469
so if I may just do it on that also

147
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,240
regarding the legislation also to

148
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:33,889
country that would actually allow for

149
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,349
example self-driving car if I my own

150
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:38,599
more traditional note could have a big

151
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:40,669
competition what do you think about this

152
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,430
do you actually believe in no no car

153
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,020
accidents in the future i think in us

154
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:51,409
already they've been tested so maybe

155
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:54,889
your experience from us so you know you

156
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:57,529
know first of all nothing is perfect in

157
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,589
this world you know we spend ton of

158
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:03,979
money to make sure there are no plane

159
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:06,050
crashes and they are we spend billions

160
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:09,080
of dollars to protect nuclear weapon

161
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,949
nope no Clara basically power plants to

162
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:16,099
not have accident and they are so you

163
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:19,219
know expecting perfect technology is not

164
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:22,310
realistic and we have to set right

165
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:26,080
expectations you know while we have been

166
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:30,919
talking in last 30 more than 30 minutes

167
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,620
in conventional cars more than 10 times

168
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:35,448
size of these room people died why we

169
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,370
have been talking in the car accident

170
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,899
more than 2,000 people died during how

171
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,948
during the time what we have been

172
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:45,980
speaking that's the reality and you know

173
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:49,459
so driving cars has opportunity to

174
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:54,529
basically reduce that not have 1 million

175
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:56,390
fatalities per year maybe only 200,000

176
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,760
or hundred thousand days will be a huge

177
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:02,750
huge improvement it will save million

178
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,959
lives but the issue has to be addressed

179
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:08,300
very carefully because in American legal

180
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,359
system if you have holes at home

181
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,000
appliance which will cause 200,000

182
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:20,089
deaths per year will be not acceptable

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,980
so so basically society has to be ready

184
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:24,980
and an improperly under standard

185
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,190
phenomena and and government will need

186
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,769
to change the regulations to save these

187
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:33,860
million lives it should not be viewed as

188
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:38,329
this news are driving car cause 200,000

189
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:42,230
deaths no it's save a million lives and

190
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:44,628
current US legal system is not ready for

191
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:47,899
that European system is slightly

192
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:52,730
different and I don't know no much less

193
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:55,309
but you know this technology will not be

194
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,559
perfect and we need to deploy it we need

195
00:09:55,309 --> 00:10:02,059
to save people lives and there will be

196
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:05,059
huge debates how to do it and you can

197
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:08,629
take two extremes you can be continuing

198
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:10,790
improving for example perceived safety

199
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:14,839
of this car by making them slower and

200
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:17,149
slower but at certain point it will be

201
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:19,009
inconvenient for people to use and all

202
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:21,559
the concepts utterly irrelevant because

203
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:24,799
it is inconvenient people will use other

204
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:28,730
conventional technology so because it's

205
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:30,920
coming in next five to ten years well as

206
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:35,179
I would say more of closer to five years

207
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:38,540
than ten years I think that this debate

208
00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:42,549
has to be there and repair the society

209
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:45,139
ground and basically legislation ground

210
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:47,689
to successfully incorporated technology

211
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,089
because every new technology has the

212
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:52,790
resistance you know you know when car

213
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,379
started you know people has to be

214
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,579
running this flag up front of the car to

215
00:10:54,379 --> 00:11:04,249
warn other people and society adopted so

216
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:06,138
I view that even bigger challenge on

217
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:11,540
society signed and the technological

218
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:15,519
challenge to accept that if I may jump

219
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:20,480
into this the concept of nobility is

220
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:23,660
changing and how a person gets from

221
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,970
point A to point B and back whether it's

222
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,059
a piece of work or play place of

223
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,759
residence in this obviously safety

224
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:35,569
becomes an issue and sustainability

225
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:41,779
where emissions etc become an issue so

226
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:46,490
India China is the mobility answer to

227
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:50,179
mobility is a hundred vehicles per

228
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,830
thousand in here but if we had that kind

229
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:54,829
of volumes

230
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:57,890
in India would be a totally different

231
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,560
challenge and probably totally not be

232
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:04,640
sustainable so the mobility concept

233
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:09,469
itself needs to be relooked for it is

234
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:13,040
going to be so the the master transport

235
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:16,430
systems need to be collaborative they're

236
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,329
also the industry four-point-oh pass

237
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:23,959
cards which are possibly going to about

238
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:27,410
75 million of them being produced as

239
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:32,480
hear that how many of them are going to

240
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:36,310
go to active safety systems passive

241
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:40,820
systems fewer them we saw that there was

242
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:45,140
we need active active safety systems so

243
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:48,380
at least the first step active system

244
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:52,300
where the vehicles start talking to each

245
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,550
other and maintain some some without

246
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,910
even the driver realizing another

247
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,790
another ECU or something takes over

248
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,069
twerking with with the commercial

249
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:06,230
vehicle the Daimler commercial vehicle

250
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,440
in India which is called Bharat bends

251
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,770
that trial is on for a for a safety

252
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,600
system and and the challenges in India

253
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:19,250
are totally different where you don't

254
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,960
even have the markers for Elaine so so

255
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,110
you have to adjust to the end of road

256
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,780
rather than the you know seeing the

257
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,380
divider in the lane so there are there

258
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:34,730
are these challenges maybe look at

259
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:38,630
mobility and not look at the auto set

260
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:41,870
auto set is one piece of mobility I

261
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:46,040
think and my friend who's just come from

262
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:48,260
Boston from MIT close to MIT this

263
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,469
disruption is already happening there

264
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,050
they have small pods I saw that in the

265
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:57,230
media lab they have small pods you can

266
00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:00,859
sit in that pod go to a location and

267
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:04,510
keep that part there it sort of also

268
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:06,580
takes minimal space for parking and then

269
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,939
you can you can just keep doing this so

270
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:13,990
is that going to change how we look at

271
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:16,570
mobility is the mass system mass

272
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,580
transport system going to change the way

273
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,080
the mobility is seen so these are some

274
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,660
of the questions which are going to come

275
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,190
in mr. Cena may I ask lavaca is the

276
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,689
biggest car producer per capita I don't

277
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,010
have to tell you it is of course but do

278
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,110
you think we shall try to find a niche

279
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,300
maybe in with an automotive sector in

280
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,640
innovation for example by easing the

281
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:41,199
Delhi distillation with self-driving

282
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:45,640
cars besides spoken it before there is a

283
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:48,130
lot of layers of this question if we

284
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,939
talk about it say the production part

285
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:53,260
because matter dolly is really right now

286
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,820
then turn on my point of view the

287
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,569
biggest one till one supplier in

288
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:01,000
Slovakia thanks to the 43 car makers now

289
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,010
but fortunately the fourth one is coming

290
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,270
already which is a good message not only

291
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:09,520
for us but before all the economics the

292
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:12,220
neighborhood because really silica

293
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,069
silica stew a small country only 5.5

294
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,330
million inhabitants and this is a small

295
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:20,950
market baby do in the audience all of

296
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,920
you you know this may be the difference

297
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,210
between the third generation a

298
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,390
revolution because the digital factory

299
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:31,030
now we are talking about a 4.0 which is

300
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:32,890
the smart industries this is a

301
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:36,850
difference between those and main

302
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:40,210
difference in short to say is a to make

303
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:43,390
it more autonomous units which have been

304
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:47,920
had been managed in the past on one very

305
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:50,980
strong one tight structure we have a

306
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,770
good opportunity to be a developer of

307
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,840
such a autonomous units because we are

308
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:58,750
our core business is a stamping and

309
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,140
welding on asus it means that the welded

310
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:06,880
parts for a body invite cars we simply

311
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:08,439
build some parts of body of cars you

312
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,180
cannot see that there are structural

313
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,590
parts the skin pass they built the

314
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,420
producers OEMs by themselves because

315
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,570
there is hidden certain know how in

316
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,229
design

317
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:24,590
and for this we need to have a accept

318
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,380
the engineering design company also a

319
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,630
good tool makers good tool design

320
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,360
firstly than toolmakers optum a shin

321
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,780
then we do have also them some stamping

322
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,420
facilities with the latest sort of

323
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:40,730
technology for stamping transfer

324
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,380
stamping for example and so on also in

325
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,210
the meantime we are changing the

326
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,180
material from the steel for aluminium

327
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:49,250
very source of casting with aluminum now

328
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,969
the components are the compounds are

329
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:55,280
coming in place for a short future which

330
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,520
means and then we have to join somehow

331
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,490
the parts which we are used to stand

332
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,040
before and this all has to be done by

333
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,230
some unit which could work out to

334
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,819
animals but in the connection to the

335
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,589
previous operations let's say to the

336
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:12,379
standing Department to the logistics

337
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,230
intelligence and a next one after this

338
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,510
also to the store and to customer

339
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,180
because we are running just in time or

340
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,160
just in seconds in some some examples

341
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,400
which means we have a very good

342
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,189
opportunity to be in the process and to

343
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,010
be a developer of the real units by

344
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:33,530
ourselves and accept this standing and

345
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,720
welding is the biggest activity of

346
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,750
Matador we have a company in two min

347
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,820
surprised me I engineering which are the

348
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:43,430
guys this is a really start up this is a

349
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:47,270
question if the startups can do only the

350
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:49,910
guys from garage or if also the quite

351
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,400
big companies big means in the European

352
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,130
term small to employ more than 250

353
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,170
people which is also sometimes not

354
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,360
useful I think because if you have a

355
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,400
company you are successful then you grow

356
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,040
in the next two years you have you

357
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,980
employ more than 250 and boom you can

358
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,129
get cut because you are become a big

359
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:13,460
company this is the question but we

360
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,890
started with three guys checking the

361
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:19,150
system and now we have we employ about

362
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:22,550
60 guys there the turnover has grown

363
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:25,670
until 35 million euros in last 3 years

364
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,129
which is very good but basics is they

365
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:29,620
are young guys young people we take

366
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,050
every year from the universe

367
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,659
the best students here and it is in

368
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:37,149
Slovakia to be honest lack of good

369
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,160
people logoff and with those guys

370
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,960
redeveloped really the latest

371
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,670
technologies according to the automotive

372
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,100
industrial part we are not talking about

373
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:48,340
the human robots man half this is a

374
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:53,020
touch you should feel ya you should have

375
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:55,300
to see ya then you have to basically the

376
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:59,680
three abilities we do have touch because

377
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:04,059
is we are an integrator of cuca I've are

378
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,100
robots and last month we sent with salt

379
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,440
that the first implementation of the

380
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,540
Kookaburra robots to skoda which is

381
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,450
simply collaborative robots which has a

382
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:17,200
touch which fields and this is a part

383
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:20,140
that is more part of Industry 40 but

384
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,540
really robot is working in line with the

385
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,660
human with people and we are sure that

386
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:28,270
he cannot damage he cannot maybe makes

387
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:31,270
an accident to the colleagues to the

388
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,790
people one of the very very very few

389
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:37,660
implementations of such robots in this

390
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:40,030
region of 230 and the DC robots could on

391
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,790
it fear of commissioning I have played

392
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:45,129
with this robot HS because we put on

393
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:49,480
plays and digital camera it means the

394
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:52,290
robot is so he was a chance I almost in

395
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,720
a very few of a very few minutes yeah

396
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:58,780
but this is this is like a touch ok then

397
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,980
you see in this the naked me you can you

398
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:04,840
can start to think already right now and

399
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,660
out of this money but in the connection

400
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,639
to the other lines digitally the system

401
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,860
we should do that only so please please

402
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,450
feel free mr. dimma in the meantime I

403
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,399
would actually like to enable actually

404
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,750
devices and sends yours being able to

405
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,620
communicate with each other without

406
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:23,050
human intervention for example wow

407
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,709
that's that's a little question for me

408
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,940
being not a technician at all I don't

409
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,830
know maybe one more because that would

410
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,170
be also influential onus but of course

411
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:34,360
also other panels are more than welcome

412
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:36,360
to to comment on that I mean I mean in

413
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,229
general generally spoken of course

414
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,070
standards is always an issue

415
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:48,470
hmm you know a standard setter in our

416
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:50,120
industry in terms of industry 4.0 for

417
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,900
example when it comes to production we

418
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,928
have a vast number of working groups

419
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,679
really working on quality standards in

420
00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:04,549
production on how can parts talk to

421
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:09,520
machines and how can be how can speed

422
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:12,139
this be safe and and and proper and I

423
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,129
yeah that's that's maybe my answer

424
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:19,370
actually that's yeah gentlemen's would

425
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:22,549
you like to comment on that as well yeah

426
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:25,760
I'm actually very fortunate my friend

427
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:31,010
his company called RTI called a little

428
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:37,280
diamond elation easier Schneider and is

429
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:39,830
in United States and basically Wall

430
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,889
Street Journal and Forbes they voted

431
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:45,530
this company number one influential

432
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,960
company for industrial Internet of

433
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:54,139
Things IOT and communication protocols

434
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:56,660
and meeting him once per month it is

435
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:59,330
interesting to observe that so what word

436
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,669
you can view that in too few layers you

437
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:05,178
know you have bottom layer which is the

438
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:08,600
hardware and it was highly diverse in

439
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:11,990
the past you had mips are and both pc

440
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,449
and so on but the cost is being reduced

441
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:17,809
by reducing number of the platform so

442
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,669
seems like two major platform Armin and

443
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:22,760
an Intel is emerging on the hardware

444
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:24,650
layer once you have father in place the

445
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,440
next thing is how it communicates the

446
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:31,250
protocols so the rest under decision

447
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:34,130
bodies were all big companies Cisco

448
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,470
int'l and son are participating Europe

449
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,960
is participating Europe try to create on

450
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:42,770
standardization body and but eventually

451
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,210
they merged with us one and this is the

452
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,250
communication layer that you have

453
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,840
standard ways of parts talking to each

454
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,840
other in predictable way and

455
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:56,240
already these standards are used across

456
00:22:52,789 --> 00:23:01,850
the industries like GE general electrics

457
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,049
or you know US Army and and many others

458
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,090
components are using this

459
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:08,330
standardization software layer that's

460
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:10,010
the middleware and that the relatively

461
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:15,428
good standardized there was two

462
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:15,429
different competing platform but

463
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,320
you
