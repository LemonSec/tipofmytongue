supporting innovation Slovakia is

38
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:15,230
definitely perceiving the fact that

39
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,179
innovation is very important and we

40
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,160
started at the Ministry of Finance one

41
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,620
and a half year ago an initiative which

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,260
was focused on supporting startups and

43
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,840
startup ecosystem the strategy has been

44
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:29,030
approved by the government this year and

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,320
currently in the role of the Ministry of

46
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,920
Economy we are working on the

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,720
implementation of the strategy

48
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,190
at our Department of innovation and

49
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,960
business environment at the Ministry of

50
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,750
Economy we are focusing also on other

51
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,550
issues related to innovation and it is

52
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,650
the support of cluster policy and the

53
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,590
creation of innovation hubs creation of

54
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,990
connections between small and middle

55
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:55,450
sized enterprises between corporates and

56
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:58,790
universities we're also focusing on a a

57
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,950
supporting entrepreneurial education at

58
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,049
very early stages of education from

59
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,109
elementary schools in cooperation with

60
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,870
the Ministry of Education and we're also

61
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,970
focusing on smart industry or industry

62
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,540
4.0 which has been discussed in our

63
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:18,650
previous panel by our director general

64
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:21,739
miss Susanna and I ova the status quo in

65
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:25,190
Slovakia is that Slovakia is lagging

66
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:28,010
behind on innovation however we are on a

67
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,109
right track and the government has its

68
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,239
priority to support innovation and to

69
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,490
support innovation in the industrial

70
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:39,940
sector that Slovakia has been very much

71
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,940
focused on in the 90s and before as well

72
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:47,299
our role as the government is also to

73
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,640
cooperate as much as possible with the

74
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,790
private ecosystem and with universities

75
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,070
as well we created several platforms

76
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,679
where we are discussing our policies

77
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,810
that we are proposing together with the

78
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,330
members of the Slovak startup ecosystem

79
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,850
of the Slovak innovation ecosystem and

80
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:07,130
we are getting feedback and advices from

81
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:13,910
them on what should be done in order to

82
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:16,159
foster innovation in Slovakia this pppp

83
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,880
dialogue public-private dialogue has

84
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,630
proven to be very effective and we are

85
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,909
coming up with very interesting measures

86
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,150
to support innovation now I would like

87
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,650
to actually call up our distinguished

88
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,679
panelists to talk about the innovation

89
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,510
policy and their point of view on what

90
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,950
the government should do in order to

91
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,230
support innovation and what are the

92
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,630
police is that we should focus at in

93
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:44,210
order to boost innovation in our country

94
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,129
so first of all I would like to call mr.

95
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,909
shell fry right

96
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:53,689
to touch upon this point and talk about

97
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:57,409
his experiences from Israel thank you

98
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:58,939
very much I would like to begin with the

99
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,938
expression that has been mentioned

100
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:06,259
several times too many times in fact and

101
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:08,509
it's called innovation so we have to

102
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:11,439
dedicate to three minutes to this

103
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:14,889
expression saying what is it all about

104
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:18,349
first of all you should know that

105
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:22,129
innovation is an expression that can be

106
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:25,819
measured and in fact it is measured it

107
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:29,439
is measured as a result of several

108
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:33,319
factors that are together affecting

109
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:36,949
innovation if you are familiar with the

110
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,909
EIS European innovation scoreboard you

111
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:45,189
can see year after year we're all

112
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:50,539
European countries are in this range

113
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:53,059
there is a right hand range which is for

114
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:55,279
the leaders of innovation countries like

115
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:58,099
Switzerland and Finland and Sweden and

116
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:01,519
so on and on the other hand you have

117
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:05,688
countries that lagging behind and needs

118
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:08,419
a lot of improvement one of them for

119
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:13,159
instance is Peter mentioned is Slovakia

120
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:16,459
which is not doing so well on this scale

121
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:18,740
of innovation once we understand what

122
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:22,429
are the factors that can affect

123
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:27,499
innovation and how are they measured we

124
00:06:22,429 --> 00:06:29,058
can speak more fluently and openly about

125
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:32,959
the innovation because if you want to

126
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:36,949
increase it we have to understand what

127
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:42,649
factors are composing this single word

128
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:47,839
innovation you have the World Forum in

129
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:53,300
Davos which issues yearly comparison

130
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:55,369
between 140 countries as far as

131
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,150
innovation is concerned and again you

132
00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:02,060
will see where your country is Slovakia

133
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:06,770
well and us and so on and so on so when

134
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:09,370
we are discussing innovation we have to

135
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:13,450
remember that it is immeasurable a

136
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:16,760
factor that has to be improved here in

137
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:20,870
Slovakia I thought to myself what are

138
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:23,570
the reasons that Slovakia is in a

139
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:26,870
condition that it should take some

140
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:30,290
measures to improve innovation and we

141
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:34,010
can discuss it for the vol de but one

142
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:37,760
thing that can be seen immediately is a

143
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:42,820
R&D to GDP ratio which is a measure of

144
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:48,980
the generally speaking the amount of R&D

145
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:53,300
dedicated relative to the GDP you have

146
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:56,750
the target set by the EU for 2020 of

147
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:00,020
three percent it was a target set for

148
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:04,420
2010 and it wasn't achievable then

149
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:07,760
another set of values well put on

150
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:10,750
nevertheless in Slovakia it's less than

151
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:16,730
one percent to be more precisely for

152
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:20,630
2012 it was point 82 which is really a

153
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:24,020
remarkable low figure so at least you

154
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,570
have to do it quite relatively quickly

155
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:30,260
and at least to pass the one percent

156
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:32,090
barrier which may lead to higher figures

157
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,000
if not the three percent is not

158
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:39,170
achievable it's a dream but still you

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,440
have countries like Austria with two

160
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,420
point eight percent and you have other

161
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,200
countries that you can follow up and see

162
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:53,180
the figures that are much higher than

163
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,820
the one prevailing in Slovakia I would

164
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,609
like to conclude my introduction by

165
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,570
saying that as far as I understood from

166
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:06,650
yesterday discussion money for R&D I

167
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:11,240
speak is not in short it's available and

168
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:12,660
the question is how to use it in an

169
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,180
efficient way and we will

170
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,300
disqus on that issue little bit later

171
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,750
thank you for thank you concluding with

172
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:26,219
money we I would like to ask Adam to

173
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:28,170
touch upon what is maybe the role of the

174
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,480
government in your perspective as a

175
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,969
representative of private equity

176
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,620
investment fund what is the role of

177
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,689
corporates what is the role of the

178
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,339
government how should we enhance

179
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:43,439
innovation Thank You honor to be here by

180
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,970
the way as the token North American on

181
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:50,639
the stage so I'll try and be boisterous

182
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:52,560
and annoying and loud but I'll speak

183
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:57,569
actually more from my private experience

184
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,670
than my job so I I've had the privilege

185
00:09:57,569 --> 00:10:01,729
to live and study and work in a few of

186
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,449
these you know hubs of innovation

187
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,879
kitchener-waterloo in canada where

188
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:11,029
blackberry came from which used to be

189
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:15,480
cool Silicon Valley now obvious reasons

190
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:16,980
gothenburg for for a year london went to

191
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,209
business school and sort of a financial

192
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,519
and and other types of innovation so

193
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,680
what I've seen work really well as far

194
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,180
as government fostering you know is is

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,550
providing the right infrastructure to

196
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,399
foster innovation the right environment

197
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,269
so you need to create the right climate

198
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:41,730
for an ecosystem to thrive right it was

199
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:44,250
looking recently at this trying to

200
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,589
educate myself a bit on on the situation

201
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,420
in Slovakia correctly right so it was a

202
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:51,029
KPMG report we looked at recently sort

203
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,519
of the state of of Slovak startups and

204
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,350
if one of the charts that stuck out of

205
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,870
my mind was you know what do we do

206
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:02,069
really well in Slovakia and and the the

207
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,420
number one thing would be really well is

208
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:05,550
technical experience and technical

209
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,130
know-how we have very strong

210
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,469
universities and a very strong workforce

211
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,689
on the technical side what do we do the

212
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,769
least well was sort of business

213
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:20,099
intuition which struck me and I don't

214
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:21,990
pretend to know the root causes I do

215
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,310
know a little bit of Slovakia I'm

216
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,350
married to Slovakia so I've spin

217
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,079
quite a bit of time of the last 10 years

218
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,330
in Slovakia so a great affinity for the

219
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,070
country but just based on some of the

220
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,290
things we've talked about the last the

221
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,070
last few days it would seem to me that

222
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,170
some sort of a you know a formal

223
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:43,690
fostering of linkages between your

224
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,939
strong technical schools and strong

225
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,520
business commerce institutions which

226
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,460
could be private or they could be there

227
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,260
could be educational institutions so one

228
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,480
of the questions would be you know does

229
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,200
the Slovakia have you know a strong

230
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:04,230
leading business education system in

231
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:07,570
place now both for youth as well as for

232
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,420
mature folks who want to go back to do

233
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,810
say executive education learn about new

234
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,849
venture development startup education

235
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:19,150
and and so one of the ideas would be to

236
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,620
foster on that standpoint strong

237
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:24,689
linkages between the technical schools

238
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,830
and and the business community and or

239
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:30,940
fostering a strong business education

240
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,440
environment most not all but most

241
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,750
successful startups have a strong

242
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,339
business person aligned with the strong

243
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,589
technical person right whether it's

244
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,140
apple or hewlett-packard or monocle and

245
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:43,720
strong sales marketing business mind and

246
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,860
that business intuition it's it's it's

247
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,450
actually interesting because if you look

248
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,980
at that chart again of what's lucky does

249
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,140
really well you've got that you've got

250
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,610
the technical side that's there but if

251
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,980
that business intuition side effect

252
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,440
charts true then you need to beef that

253
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,089
up so as far as a government policy

254
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,400
perspective which I don't pretend to be

255
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:02,530
an expert on but that would be at least

256
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,750
where my perception of where the focus

257
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,230
should be we actually mentioned a very

258
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,150
important point the education of

259
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:12,430
business or the business perception

260
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,319
among the youth here in Slovakia based

261
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,939
on our assessment that we were doing

262
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,260
last year before we came up with the

263
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,660
measures in the strategy to support

264
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,670
startups we came to the conclusion that

265
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,850
actually the entrepreneurial culture is

266
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,839
quite negatively perceived or

267
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,270
entrepreneurship as such is negatively

268
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,650
perceived here in Slovakia and of course

269
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,019
this is something that we cannot really

270
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:37,089
affect by

271
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:40,029
a quick win police's we are trying to

272
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:42,369
focus more on educating entrepreneurial

273
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,079
education in elementary schools as well

274
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:46,600
as well and we are in discussion with

275
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,998
the Ministry of Education do you think

276
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,179
this is the right direction for the

277
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:54,029
government to get involved in trying to

278
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:56,019
switch the perception of

279
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,410
entrepreneurship some of your great

280
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,309
young entrepreneurs and incubator

281
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,799
mentors over the last few days you've

282
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:04,179
got there out there right so it's it's a

283
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,920
sense of getting them in front of people

284
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:08,019
get them in front of the students get

285
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,349
them in front of the youth get them on

286
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:13,809
TV and I'll get get get some of your

287
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,689
strong potential and over leverage them

288
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:18,309
over expose them so that people get a

289
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,569
sense of you know the you know these

290
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:21,189
people are here you've got great people

291
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:23,349
that have come back to selected recently

292
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:25,360
from experience abroad and they want to

293
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,980
build their businesses here so they need

294
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,809
to get their stories out and and other

295
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,509
people need to look up to them as role

296
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:33,969
models just very information if you

297
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:38,110
mention the word entrepreneur in sand

298
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,850
exactly so we need a new word I can toss

299
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,589
out our chip Andrus in the Department

300
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:45,339
for innovation you know Kofi ilysm for

301
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,480
animal thank you Tony you are

302
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:49,420
representing the European Commission

303
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,850
here of course we are also in discussion

304
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,089
in our roles in the ministry of economy

305
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,309
with the european commission we are

306
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:59,619
working together on the digital single

307
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:02,110
market strategy that you are an expert

308
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:09,269
on in the european commission this is

309
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:09,269
definitely a regulation that has the the

310
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:16,768
the rationale for the European member

311
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:21,189
states to implement and to try to have

312
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:23,470
to take away the barriers between the

313
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:26,618
European member states so what should be

314
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:29,379
done by slovakia by the member states in

315
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:30,759
in in this regard and how should we

316
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:34,419
foster and help the european commission

317
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:36,509
to integrate the digital market in

318
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,509
Europe

319
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:44,539
a very many thanks for inviting me here

320
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:47,368
and I mean before we really kick off and

321
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:49,139
say what what Slovakia has to do and

322
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:51,749
what European Union has to do and so on

323
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:55,970
I think it's good to take a step back

324
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:59,720
and just simply stand still for a second

325
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:07,759
but why this all matt is wide as

326
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:07,759
innovation supporting startups R&D

327
00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:12,539
entrepreneurship why does that matter

328
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,720
and why does that in particularly matter

329
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:16,859
for Europe for the moment and I think

330
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,869
because we always take it for granted

331
00:16:16,859 --> 00:16:21,179
but it's important to to remind that

332
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:25,129
also that we're still in a very

333
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:29,159
complicated economic context there is

334
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:31,589
many member states with so high

335
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:36,209
unemployment levels in particular

336
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:40,139
amongst young people there's a risk that

337
00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:43,049
a part of that generation may be facing

338
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,850
major difficulties in accessing the

339
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,799
labor market and that's why this is

340
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,399
really important I mean in the first

341
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:52,350
first and foremost it's about creating

342
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,629
possibilities for employment for youth

343
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,779
employment and of course it's also

344
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:59,970
better or industrial leadership and

345
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,769
that's why we're focusing a lot on that

346
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:04,620
I mean we're doing a lot in terms of

347
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:08,609
data to our R&D programs where there is

348
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:12,359
now much more focused and direct funding

349
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:14,819
to to the startup community and to

350
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:17,369
member states slovakia is is a candidate

351
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:21,658
for that even supporting them in setting

352
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:24,119
in setting up schemes for the national

353
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:25,889
start up for for creating the right

354
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,969
environment for the national startup

355
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:31,740
community but also as you rightly said

356
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,850
it's not just about supporting directly

357
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,639
through money it's also about creating

358
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:41,009
the right the right environment and

359
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:43,110
wired european levelled we need to talk

360
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:47,460
about a digital single market in the

361
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:49,649
first place one because yeah probably we

362
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,750
have now pretty well functioning

363
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,050
single market in the physical world so

364
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:57,810
we've done away since 1992 with most of

365
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:00,020
the barriers some keep on popping up but

366
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,700
then we try to eliminate those as well

367
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,379
but what we have we seen happening in

368
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,690
the digital world is that you know there

369
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:09,540
are new sort of technologies which

370
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,460
allowed to identify in the digital world

371
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,020
when normally the factor distance

372
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,470
doesn't play a role anymore but you can

373
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:20,420
sort of re identify where a customer

374
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:24,090
where a person is coming from geo

375
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,800
localization basically and so we see new

376
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,110
segmentations of the single market

377
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,300
happening in the digital sphere and that

378
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,669
is frankly it's not acceptable not just

379
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,950
because in the European treaties since

380
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,120
nineteen fifty-seven we have this

381
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,530
ambition that there should not be any

382
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,409
discrimination on the basis of

383
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:43,020
nationality but also because this

384
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,720
fragmentation of the single market is a

385
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,960
major handicap for our companies the

386
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,900
large companies maybe think they can

387
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:55,110
benefit from it sometimes but for

388
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,760
start-up cim which have to be globally

389
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,760
competitive this is a major challenge

390
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,520
there I i we want to contest that we

391
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,740
have a tendency to talk ourselves down

392
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,990
there is a very vibrant startup

393
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,920
community in Europe there are a lot of

394
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:16,110
places Berlin London Gothenburg they've

395
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,750
been already named but also Slovakia

396
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,659
there is and you quoted the figures from

397
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,490
from KPMG there is a vibrant startup

398
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,380
community forty percent of the more

399
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:28,380
active in the sphere in which I work

400
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:31,400
namely the the digital sphere so there

401
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:36,300
is no lack of that but still startups

402
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:38,910
because of this setup have a tendency to

403
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:41,610
only address a national market from the

404
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:44,940
outset which you know in the best case

405
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:47,760
is 80 million customers in the U which

406
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,220
is a single market of 510 million

407
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,740
customers of 20 million companies when

408
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,020
you talk about the b2b sphere and we're

409
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,910
not addressing it it's being segmented

410
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,070
so that we have to get rid of that's a

411
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,730
program which we have it yours and a lot

412
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:05,210
of that will come true also through the

413
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,370
to the for adoption during the Slovak

414
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,930
presidencies we count on your support in

415
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,209
that framework as well so there will be

416
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,530
legislation but there is as you said

417
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,010
there are also things which the Member

418
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:17,570
States need to do it at their level and

419
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:20,450
and we can we can consider I wanted to

420
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,810
ask you about how should Slovakia

421
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,460
position itself during its presidency in

422
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:27,830
the agent of digital single market how

423
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:31,700
can be collaborative with raping the

424
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:34,730
European digital market well as I

425
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:40,880
explained the Commission will propose a

426
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:45,050
series of legislative steps and notably

427
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:49,310
on banning geo-blocking on reforming

428
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:51,440
copyright in the European Union those

429
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,540
are important measures complicated

430
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,700
measures because of course behind that

431
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:00,080
there may be some vested interests and

432
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,270
therefore it will be very important that

433
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,139
we have to support both of the European

434
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:09,200
Parliament and from member states and as

435
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:13,100
a presidency you of course play you will

436
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,470
have a critical role to play in in

437
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,850
conducting those negotiations and always

438
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:24,050
they said maybe always reminding your

439
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:26,480
fellow your fellow member states in the

440
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,210
in the Council of Ministers at European

441
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,910
level yeah that there may be some vested

442
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,520
interest but there are maybe some

443
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,650
overarching economic and political

444
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,510
ambitions which we should have in Europe

445
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,820
namely that ultimately this is about

446
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:45,650
fostering as i explained growth and jobs

447
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:48,379
and investing in our future thanks radko

448
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:50,210
you are representing a corporate one of

449
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,370
the biggest companies in the world that

450
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:56,450
used to be maybe a start-up 40 or 50

451
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:59,540
years ago how are you cooperating with

452
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,250
with the innovation ecosystem in the

453
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,210
center and eastern european market and

454
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:07,390
where do you see the role of Microsoft

455
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,530
in collaborating with different

456
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:13,790
stakeholders of the of the innovation

457
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:16,110
ecosystem yeah thank you know

458
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:18,270
well I don't think Mike's which is

459
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:22,169
really different when you say how you

460
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:23,940
see the Roloff I think the companies are

461
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,430
now growing in the in a different way

462
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,680
that they used to like 20 30 40 years

463
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,560
ago right so they also need to build the

464
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:35,940
kind of ecosystems and platforms to try

465
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:37,740
one right so Microsoft spending I think

466
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,260
around ten billion dollars every year on

467
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,420
research in the development but still

468
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,620
they cannot grow only on that right so

469
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,930
on new venture second system today and

470
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,520
it's shifting toward the new ventures

471
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,320
right so when you look at the big ones

472
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,910
and how they grow from the open

473
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,860
innovation perspective for example

474
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,090
they're actively looking at the markets

475
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,740
and they're researching you know what

476
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,500
should be our net next step what should

477
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,930
be our next growth should we continue to

478
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,540
for example grow on windows and office

479
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,130
right or should we grow on something

480
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,960
else which is I'd around today cloud

481
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,090
computing and services related to this

482
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,320
one that's that's a huge step for for

483
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,800
the corporation it's hard to do that

484
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,050
only from the internal perspective and i

485
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,120
would say that a lot of them actually

486
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,850
are looking into the ways how they can

487
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:26,820
interact we do have a corporate programs

488
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:29,280
i think they have a bigger one every

489
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,929
corporation have something like you

490
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,780
heard about them Microsoft ventures or

491
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,340
google ventures so you're actively

492
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,500
sourcing you're looking for the deals

493
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,990
you know where you should invest and not

494
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,670
necessarily only in the field of your

495
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:43,770
expertise or what what your business

496
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:47,160
current business model is is looking for

497
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:49,530
so you can see that especially in

498
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,740
finance worlders but they're not really

499
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:55,200
men dating that the stuff which is

500
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,850
growing from there should we be used or

501
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,070
deployable the only now in my our core

502
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,600
business so they will look really openly

503
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,610
into you know what is the next because

504
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,520
they're building a bigger ecosystem than

505
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:08,040
this one what's missing from that

506
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,420
perspective is that you know we should

507
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,889
encourage more from the different

508
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:14,520
perspective including policy perspective

509
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:16,530
that bit organizations are spending more

510
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,230
time and money into something like this

511
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:20,730
so that we have you have this money

512
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,170
which is coming from the from the from

513
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,840
the government's from the European Union

514
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,370
which supports innovation and growing

515
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,580
the entrepreneurs you have

516
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,559
our venture capital which which is

517
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,210
currently I think the biggest driver

518
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,490
from that perspective even if you look

519
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,800
at the numbers it's not it's still still

520
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,180
public and then we should increase also

521
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,889
this spending which is coming from the

522
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,890
corporate ventures that's calling this

523
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,870
way so that people can have more options

524
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,970
you know how they can grow from there

525
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:50,189
how specific company look at this one

526
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,830
you know it's not that its massive it's

527
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,000
supported its policy helped through the

528
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,679
policy all through some regular

529
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,870
regulation it's it's things to do I

530
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:01,230
think you have to do something like that

531
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:02,879
and I think you know people should look

532
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,380
at every single option in from the equal

533
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,050
pay for equal perspective right

534
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,510
depending on where you are at your

535
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:11,309
growth stage for example I was you know

536
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:13,170
that everybody is using that example i

537
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:15,530
was in Estonia I was talking to their

538
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,760
tech Nepalis it's a bigger because the

539
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,870
kind of incubator technology incubator

540
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,000
over there and they have this huge

541
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,159
really nice chart of how we are

542
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,960
supporting people in the you know in

543
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,550
their development phase and I was

544
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,230
surprised at least that was the first

545
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:31,129
time when I was started to or the idea

546
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:35,700
itself right so they're investing into

547
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:37,650
primary schools or different incubators

548
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,450
trying to support the innovation

549
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,120
creation right they're not really

550
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,220
thinking like oh now I have the the idea

551
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,979
and now i'm going to you know invest

552
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,170
into idea or at any specific stage of

553
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,880
the startup so there's a lot of options

554
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:53,309
and I think the corporations are really

555
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,679
looking into this one not that actively

556
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:57,330
that much big ones for sure but there's

557
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,110
a huge potential especially in something

558
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:03,510
that because medium sized organizations

559
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,100
which could use area we have a press

560
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,679
conference with the minister and

561
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:12,590
representatives of the the spp this

562
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:15,420
lower gas corporate and a know about

563
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,580
hackathon so it's going is working

564
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,330
together with the government and other

565
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:23,040
private stakeholders of the ecosystem

566
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,960
where corporates are defining their

567
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,240
specific challenges that they would like

568
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,700
to resolve by very innovative and

569
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,780
creative ideas that they would like to

570
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:35,820
get from from the ecosystem does this

571
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,980
create actually value for corporates

572
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:42,860
radtke what do you think decide

573
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:44,510
to type of the approaches so I would say

574
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,209
it's so obvious you want to think like

575
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:49,160
this like hackathon but I in general I

576
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,220
think that a lot of them are really open

577
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,620
they don't even define their own

578
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:57,169
problems so we had a Microsoft we had a

579
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,629
lot of opportunities to basically use at

580
00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:02,330
our different programs that basically

581
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:04,210
used something some generic worldwide

582
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,530
challenges like you know worldwide

583
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,270
issues that people have like I don't

584
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:11,149
know how do you how do we feed people in

585
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,679
30 years from now there will be like

586
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,750
forty percent more people on the on the

587
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:16,580
earth so how we support that with the

588
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,230
technology actually it's nothing nothing

589
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,520
really connected to a Microsoft for me

590
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,799
perspective okay what would be the next

591
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,110
you know business case for us but I

592
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,668
think it's a valid question and we can

593
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,219
help with the technology and money to do

594
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,960
that and just to you know to finalize

595
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,970
when you when you look look we're

596
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,100
currently we are contributing the most

597
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:36,710
from that perspective actually it's a

598
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,299
foundation it's billund and Bill Gates

599
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,040
malindo Foundation which is trying to

600
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:42,080
solve those issues so how you use that

601
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,850
money to really impact and solve some

602
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,799
some of the things for good you know

603
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,418
let's let's eliminate some of the

604
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:49,879
diseases that's a millennium challenge

605
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:52,840
right Megan Adam you wanted to comment

606
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,940
on muskrat or how does Microsoft

607
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,020
delineate between what internal so if

608
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,020
you're going to do a hackathon how do

609
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,610
you decide sort of what is a public need

610
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,840
that you're okay you know in a hackathon

611
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:07,510
environment versus things you want to

612
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:10,459
keep frankly closer to the chest yeah a

613
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,260
bunch of years ago when I when I first

614
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,700
time visited research in the development

615
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:16,070
that say arms inside the organization

616
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,470
right I was surprised they actually

617
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,149
they're they're they're actually

618
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:24,049
functioning the same way as you would

619
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:26,540
expect some external incubator or I'd in

620
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,190
a research center would would do some of

621
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,379
them from the open perspective some of

622
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,120
them just like died in a day they

623
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,510
research and they die and some of them

624
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,949
became like a global hit some of them

625
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:39,559
some of them are integrated with

626
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,809
specific knowledge for example Israel is

627
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,990
having great startups which we also like

628
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:48,290
from the perspective of are here are

629
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:50,590
algorithms and some startup elements we

630
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,800
can we can use and build on top of it

631
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,720
but

632
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,550
you know those things stay inside the

633
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,290
company because you pretty quickly you

634
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,700
see what will be the next growth but

635
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,740
some of them go outside people go

636
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,810
outside and then and they start their

637
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,750
own startups they continue to do work on

638
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:07,490
them or you know what because it doesn't

639
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,320
make sense so you just grow them right

640
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,150
and then you make some of the things

641
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,200
public and usually I'm I'm surprised you

642
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:15,110
can do that when you look at the

643
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,820
corporation's go and research keepers to

644
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,379
the outside world you know how many

645
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,879
people from Microsoft our research

646
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,550
division actually work with the

647
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,470
university's off you know and contribute

648
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,879
algorithms and so forth and you can see

649
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,070
there's a lot of developments over there

650
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,700
so I think it's a nice balance how do

651
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,409
you do that how you are coming from a

652
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,810
country which is a top-performing

653
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:37,340
country in terms of innovation and

654
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:42,110
innovative for many countries here in

655
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:45,350
Europe but also else in the world you

656
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:48,949
are actually a best practice in terms of

657
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:52,870
venture capital system yeah as a small

658
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:55,190
country such as Israel how to boost

659
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:57,649
investments how to boost venture capital

660
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:01,910
how to boost business angel activities

661
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:06,680
in the innovation ecosystem I'll put it

662
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:10,340
this way and to increase the involvement

663
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:13,670
of angels and VCs etc is a long process

664
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:16,490
and I am sure that at least part of the

665
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:20,450
audience here asking themselves okay

666
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:22,760
nice talking smart guys but what will we

667
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,740
do tomorrow morning and tomorrow morning

668
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,300
I mean in a half year time as I'm glad

669
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:32,900
it and I said what I saw yesterday and

670
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,669
understand that first of all the

671
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,750
Slovakian people generally are very

672
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:42,680
smart knowing all the tools available

673
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:45,770
say I have the money to perform what are

674
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:48,590
lacking is immediate actions that should

675
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,600
be taken and this immediate actions they

676
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:53,540
should be taken can start tomorrow

677
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:57,800
morning for instance if you take

678
00:30:53,540 --> 00:31:00,909
countries like Finland and it takes

679
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,350
Sweden etc you see that they have

680
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:07,450
established and agencies

681
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:11,899
to this capable of direct support

682
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:13,880
industrial R&D on top of other missions

683
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,500
for instance teka see supporting if I am

684
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,160
not mistaken the university's their

685
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:21,620
project etc but I am concentrating on

686
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:25,429
industrial R&D and this is something

687
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:29,479
that probably your ministry should

688
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:32,990
exhibit solving all internal problems

689
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:35,870
that you have here with other formally

690
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:38,600
no way private entities like this

691
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:41,178
business association and then the other

692
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,850
ministries etc tever it's something that

693
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:47,360
can be solved and the politicians on the

694
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:50,000
higher level agreed that these steps

695
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,408
should be taken so why not to take this

696
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,309
opportunity and put it into practice by

697
00:31:53,409 --> 00:32:02,419
saying that I mean that you have to put

698
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:04,309
an agency capable of doing the whole

699
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:06,950
inside outside that don't care but

700
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:09,379
putting it together putting the

701
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:13,250
decision-making process into practice

702
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:15,620
providing the assistance to good

703
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:20,020
projects according to the evaluation of

704
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:23,350
course and benefit from it for the

705
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,350
economy of the country

706
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,480
you
