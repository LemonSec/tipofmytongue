when deputy assistant secretary for

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,860
energy diplomacy Bureau of energy

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,289
resources u.s. Department of State and

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:30,450
we have also Ricardo polity and who is

22
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,150

00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:47,729
so the focus of our discussion will be

26
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:50,639
energy energy securities I mean this is

27
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,179
very often seen as a great dilemma that

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,000
we have to solve and big trade offs and

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,790
we'll explore whether that's the case or

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,380
not but first of all I would like to ask

31
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,170
mr. chef Jewish to give us a short

32
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,348
keynote speech and introduces in the

33
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,959
latest development of the energy Union a

34
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,769
project that effectively started just

35
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,250
over one

36
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:21,090
year ago when the new commission started

37
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:29,340
its work on first of November I think

38
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:31,890
who is 2014 mr. Sherrod at first that I

39
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,130
would like to thank to the organizers

40
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,570
for organizing this event for organizing

41
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,280
him in such an excellent way for

42
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,590
organizing it in my city what I

43
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,900
appreciate in particular and for

44
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,290
providing the the possibility what I

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,350
think we need a lot in Europe because I

46
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,940
think after i was listening yesterday to

47
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,590
the Deputy Prime Minister and foreign

48
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,930
minister this morning to the slow black

49
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:58,110
president I think there is one thing we

50
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,720
need in Europe we need to talk we need

51
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,190
to talk in Brussels in Western Europe we

52
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,690
need to talk in central row because

53
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,420
simply we are going through very

54
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,109
challenging times where we need to work

55
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,030
all of us governmental officials EU

56
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,630
institutions representative civic

57
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:19,770
societies NGOs on how to shape the robe

58
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,959
how to keep the Europe project full of

59
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,410
that promise well that positive content

60
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,300
it's always have I believe we will do it

61
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,340
because you're a boss shape through the

62
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,160
crisis is now we can have a feeling that

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,630
there is one crisis to many that we went

64
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,910
through very difficult economic times

65
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,640
we've been focusing the first semester

66
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,230
on the situations in Greece and of

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,440
course now we have on our hands very

68
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,709
very difficult to migration crisis as

69
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,630
well but nevertheless this panel is

70
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:54,209
about how to fuel the cooperation in the

71
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,120
field of energy and I think that here we

72
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,590
have a positive story to tell because if

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,990
somebody will tell me five or ten years

74
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,600
ago that we will be working together on

75
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,330
the energy union and we'll be presenting

76
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,850
the strategy how to get to this 28

77
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:12,660
member states and our neighbors to

78
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:15,000
support one common project for energy

79
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,370
and climate policy I would say that this

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,418
is very far Treach that it is too

81
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,810
optimistic but I have to say that since

82
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:25,969
the nine months we put our strategy for

83
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,280
the energy

84
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:32,430
Union on the table we can already say

85
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,650
there was a lot of progress achieved at

86
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,100
first I was very much encouraged that

87
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,530
such a important proposal and especially

88
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,169
the area where the National reflexes are

89
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,570
still still very very very strong got

90
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,919
the unanimous support by the heads of

91
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,139
state and government in the European

92
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,389
Council that it was positively perceived

93
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:54,800
by all the minister speed from ministers

94
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:57,840
in history council of energy transport

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,389
environment or or competitiveness and as

96
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,419
you know i started the energy union tour

97
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,370
and I covered more than 20 member states

98
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,979
where I'm trying to speak to different

99
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,680
audiences starting the government ending

100
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:12,570
with the Civic Society or young people

101
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,280
in in the schools and Mariana having

102
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,070
citizens dialogue then I can tell you

103
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,500
that energy in climate this is one topic

104
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,139
which interest everybody everybody

105
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,310
understands the clean environment

106
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:25,620
everybody understands energy bill

107
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,030
everybody understands how the energy is

108
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,050
important for the competitive

109
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,570
competitiveness of our economy of course

110
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,910
one last element which we needed to get

111
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,550
this project moving and moving with a

112
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,440
big speed was a concern on energy

113
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,539
security and that was one of the issue

114
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,840
which is very recurring which I believe

115
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:48,950
it will also discuss today so what we

116
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,070
did just in this segment since the new

117
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:56,789
strategy and very ambitious action plan

118
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:00,690
was approved of course the first big

119
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:03,240
meeting we have with a bit of it i would

120
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,010
say emergency panic feeling was what to

121
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,139
do after the soundstream project was

122
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,500
canceled it was quite clear that we need

123
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,570
to provide security for our South East

124
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,970
Bureau but you need to find a solution

125
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:18,030
for Western Balkans we need to take on

126
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,669
board the energy security concerns in

127
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,919
Moldova in Ukraine and we did it we

128
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,690
created in record time group which got

129
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,180
the acronym Kasich which stands for the

130
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,520
connectivity of Central and southeastern

131
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,620
Europe and again in very very short

132
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,190
period of time we managed to actually

133
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,250
agree on the ten key interconnect during

134
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,150
a project which would guarantee that if

135
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,010
we would really

136
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,380
acute them implement them and they are a

137
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,750
plan that each of these countries would

138
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,540
gradually enter into the situation what

139
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,490
was the first meeting in Sofia in second

140
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,320
meeting in Dubrovnik but i have to say

141
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,940
that for the first time you saw that

142
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,860
these countries were not fighting for

143
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,860
this book signed up to this declaration

144
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,370
and we had 10 projects and for bulgaria

145
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:05,850
there actually are four of them on the

146
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:09,000
list but the issue was how to make sure

147
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,470
that this region would be better inter

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,390
corrected that this region would be

149
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:16,530
better integrated in the European energy

150
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:18,840
systems and I have fur to underline that

151
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:23,549
it was the same spirit which prevailed

152
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,310
in the negotiations on finally linking

153
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,680
better iberian peninsula with the rest

154
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:32,180
of europe it was the same approach which

155
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:35,910
helped us to create the nordic and

156
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:39,630
baltic interconnectors and cooperation

157
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,830
and i have to say that it was the same

158
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:43,680
spirit default when we've been

159
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,140
discussing together with ricardo the

160
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,010
progress on the south and gas corridor

161
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:52,169
which would bring for the first time Cat

162
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:54,000
2020 and I saw how much also the

163
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,530
countries from the region are interested

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,830
in the success of this project so it's

165
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:02,369
not only Azerbaijan turkey and Georgia

166
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,109
but it's also Turkmenistan it's a these

167
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,090
are also countries from the eastern

168
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,610
Mediterranean where we also had a good

169
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:11,070
news over the last few months with the

170
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,740
new discoveries of this tremendous gas

171
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:18,060
fields close to Egypt close to Israel

172
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:19,710
and and a close close to Cyprus because

173
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,380
I believe that all these it would create

174
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,469
new possibilities for increasing energy

175
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,870
security in Europe I just came from the

176
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,580
United States and Canada and of course V

177
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,620
Europeans are pushing very much for

178
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,480
lifting the export restrictions for LNG

179
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,890
for crude oil we see positive

180
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,440
developments in the Congress and all

181
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,049
that they are very delicate negotiations

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,760
going on between administration Congress

183
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:46,920
and the Senate but I believe that seeing

184
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,819
the recent developments on the landscape

185
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,810
of of energy it's quite clear that

186
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,450
Europe is very valued very

187
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:58,180
important customers we are paying more

188
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,340
than 1 billion dollars per day for our

189
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,279
energy imports and such we definitely

190
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,110
are on the map of every possible energy

191
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,720
exporter and we just have to make sure

192
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,820
that we create preconditions for being

193
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,960
sure that we get fair prices goods

194
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,400
treatment and that we would use the

195
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,890
magnitude and the size of the biggest

196
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,470
economy in the world and this is as you

197
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,839
know very well the European Economic I

198
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,779
have to say that we went also through

199
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:29,589
the turbulent summer making sure that

200
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:31,930
Ukraine will have enough gas for its

201
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:34,060
domestic consumption and enough gas to

202
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,430
guarantee secure and safe transit to

203
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,050
Europe we had very intense trilateral

204
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,779
talks with a Ukrainian and Russian

205
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,729
partners they had very intensive

206
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,700
consultations with our international

207
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,350
financial institutions and the partners

208
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,830
and I have to say thanks to the goodwill

209
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:53,680
enormous creativity we actually managed

210
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:56,650
to secure adequate financing for this

211
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,560
heating period and we are also working

212
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,370
together on structural reform changes in

213
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,219
crime to make sure that the energy

214
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,870
system would be more and more model

215
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,820
according to the European approaches

216
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,140
they are adopting the European type of

217
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:17,980
the legislation and I think it's our

218
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:22,300
duty to to to to help them what will

219
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,280
happen in the field of the energy union

220
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,780
in the next few months I will just show

221
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:30,180
you this graph I know it's too small to

222
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:34,199
read but here you see what we want to do

223
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:37,510
and this is really the smoke buen dia

224
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,910
but what i want to show you actually is

225
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,120
that this is already done and this is

226
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,969
what we are going to do and

227
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,150
and what we what we have done was

228
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:52,750
already the start in the summer with

229
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:55,209
what I think was the most most overview

230
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,640
and what we really need it to signal

231
00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:00,580
very clearly before our conference in

232
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,180
parts how to reform our emission trading

233
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,010
system how to reform our electricity

234
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,739
electricity market design and how to

235
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,020
highlight the fact that what we do here

236
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,310
in the field of the energy Union has

237
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,170
actually one big aim and this is to make

238
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,719
sure that the European consumers are

239
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,279
treated better than before after that

240
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,070
we've been working very hard on

241
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,570
reforming our financial support for

242
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,430
research and innovation in the field of

243
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,860
energy so called strategic energy

244
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:32,170
technology plan and of course the next

245
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,350
year and therefore what I was showing

246
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:38,140
you the small graph because next year we

247
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,660
see as a year of delivery because we

248
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,480
want to present three packages first one

249
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,920
on security of supply in

250
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,580
january-february with the LNG strategy

251
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,050
with a revised security of gas supply

252
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,450
directive very want also to touch the

253
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,729
sensitive issue of transparency of the

254
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,529
contract we want to include into this

255
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,240
the heating and cooling strategy because

256
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,420
this is where we spent almost fifty

257
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,980
percent of our energy in Europe and I

258
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,529
think that we can heat and cool our

259
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,800
buildings in much more efficient way in

260
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:11,380
the summer we will be working on what I

261
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,469
believe would be a result of positive

262
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,170
outcome of cop21 in Paris meaning how we

263
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,330
can further decarbonize of our economy

264
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,250
especially the transport or what we can

265
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,860
do in so-called morning dear sectors

266
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,430
like agriculture efficiency of our

267
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,620
buildings and transport and then of

268
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,560
course we would like to conclude the

269
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:36,040
year by this landmark proposal how to

270
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,680
redesign electricity markets in Europe

271
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,480
and you know that's a huge issue because

272
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,349
we have different schemes of subsidies

273
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,350
of our energy system we are subsidizing

274
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,270
different energies it costs us 120

275
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,310
billion euros a year we are now

276
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,990
discussing in more and more country

277
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,359
so-called capacity market mechanism

278
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,920
which is additional form of type of

279
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,959
subsidy and we need to

280
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,089
find a way how to make sure the

281
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,339
electricity bill is not three or four

282
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:06,579
times higher than a electricity bill of

283
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:08,920
our partners in United States why we are

284
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:10,959
rushing so much why do I want to do it

285
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,969
everything by the end of the next next

286
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,540
year because I'm fully aware that this

287
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:18,250
would be enormous a task for the

288
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,810
college's later for the member states

289
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,970
that for the European Parliament to

290
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,550
actually transform these Commission's

291
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,180
proposals into the valid legislation so

292
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,639
we need time 2017 2018 what will remain

293
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,319
from 2019 to make sure that we actually

294
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,540
progress and that we would be leaving

295
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,490
the Commission offices with the feeling

296
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,510
that now we have solid solid fundament

297
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:43,570
for a new energy systems in Europe and

298
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:45,939
I'm rushing so much because on the 18th

299
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,820
of November when I will present the

300
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:52,810
first state of the energy union report I

301
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,350
want to ask the Member States next year

302
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,399
you will see everything on the table and

303
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,600
therefore we would like to ask you in

304
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:03,399
2017 to start to work on your long-term

305
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:06,070
National Energy and Climate plans

306
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,500
because I think every member states need

307
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,860
this political debate need this expert

308
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,990
debate and we need to move in one pace

309
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:17,019
with the same structure of the long-term

310
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,870
planning from now on until 2030 so we

311
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:23,550
can see how we are transforming our

312
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,630
energy systems together in a good

313
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,420
synchronization and in a way which we

314
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:31,510
can measure our common efforts and if

315
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:33,579
you allow me the last comment because

316
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,339
I'm sure this would the issue which

317
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:41,589
would come in a debate and this is North

318
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:44,589
three this morning I I spoke again with

319
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,089
the deputy Chancellor sigmar gabriel and

320
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:48,579
i have to say that i very much

321
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,800
appreciate the correct way how exchange

322
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:53,649
the information not only on recess you

323
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,810
notice we have quite a lot of topics to

324
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:58,029
discuss starting with the car industry

325
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:02,800
going through energy security and of

326
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:05,850
course discussing this project which

327
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,800
attracts enormous political political

328
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,570
attention and when we've been discussing

329
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,719
this project for the first time

330
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:18,490
I I told him quite clearly that look

331
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,500
from the point of view of many countries

332
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,650
in the Central and Eastern Europe it's

333
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:26,740
quite clear that this project has very

334
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:30,490
strong meaning from the point of view of

335
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,740
energy security it would it would have

336
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,110
very important consequences for the

337
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:39,070
overall gas balance in Central and

338
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,930
Eastern Europe currently the capacity

339
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,300
for transporting of the gas from Russia

340
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,579
to the EU is used only and fifty percent

341
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:50,130
so there is a lot of question marks why

342
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:53,440
the additional access transport capacity

343
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:57,550
needs to be built what does it mean for

344
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,220
the transit through Ukraine and you know

345
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,500
that it's not only commission or myself

346
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,410
who highlighting this issue but I have a

347
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,110
unanimous decision of the foreign

348
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,089
minister stated very clearly the

349
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:12,550
strategic importance on the preservation

350
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:16,390
of the on the gas transit route going

351
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:19,750
through you cry and there are of course

352
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:22,360
other and other elements which kind of

353
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:25,990
come to the forefront we need when it

354
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,060
comes to the project and of course as we

355
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,070
showed with the previous projects like

356
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,410
the South Stream for the European

357
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,290
Commission it's very clear that such a

358
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:37,930
project would fully respect European law

359
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:40,689
public procurement third energy package

360
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,719
all the environmental aspects of the

361
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:47,890
other project of this magnitude and I'm

362
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,210
very glad that mr. Gabriel gray showed

363
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,630
me that all these issues will also

364
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:55,900
raised with Russian partners that they

365
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:58,720
understand the need to find the

366
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:02,110
solutions for continuation of the gas

367
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,360
transit for a period for posts 2019 I

368
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,160
think we need to be very clear and

369
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:12,579
discuss what should be the minimum

370
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:14,980
volumes how we can use the Ukrainian gas

371
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:18,579
storage is as a strategic asset for the

372
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,449
European energy security how can we help

373
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:24,569
Ukrainian partners to reform to renovate

374
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:26,610
the the gas system here again EB

375
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,559
rd and the World Bank are doing the

376
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,689
great job and started already with the

377
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,789
partial renovations of the system but

378
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:36,480
how to make sure that we would be able

379
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:39,809
to secure adequate investments in into

380
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,929
modernization of the Ukrainian gas

381
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:45,600
system how we would make sure that the

382
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:49,710
energy security for central and

383
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,199
southeastern Europe is not weakened but

384
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,570
it's stronger in the future because this

385
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,000
is what it's the aim of the energy unit

386
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,129
to make sure that we're looking for

387
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,049
comprehensive energy security solutions

388
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:03,658
for the whole Europe and for our

389
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:06,029
partners in a energy community with our

390
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:08,429
partners to these midwestern Balkan

391
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:12,659
countries or with our partners to the to

392
00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:15,240
the subs so I think that as you have

393
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:17,610
seen there is a lot to do in the field

394
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,519
of energy Union they have action plan

395
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:23,789
I'm very glad to say we are on track but

396
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,039
I am doing this energy unit or because

397
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:28,710
I'm in a kind of campaign and trying to

398
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,990
convince you I'm trying to convince the

399
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,360
people in other European member states

400
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,250
that we need they support because I'm

401
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,408
fully conscious that we cannot build

402
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,990
energy unit in Brussels we need to build

403
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:42,450
it here in slovakia in czech republic in

404
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,009
germany in poland in all our member

405
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:46,830
states and we have to do it in

406
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:49,409
structured organized synchronized way so

407
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:51,779
our businesses would see where we are

408
00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:55,049
heading our partners will see what is

409
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:57,710
our trajectory and that our investors

410
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:57,710
will

411
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:05,449
you
