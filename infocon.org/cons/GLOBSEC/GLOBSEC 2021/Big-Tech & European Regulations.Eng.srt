23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
this panel on big deck and european

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,080
regulations here

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,159
so my name is anet numa and i work as a

26
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,920
digital transformation advisor at the

27
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,200
estonia briefing center

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,799
but i'm going to be moderating this

29
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,119
entire panel today here

30
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,119
so when we talk about the european

31
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,960
innovation ecosystems

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,520
there is a clear need to find ways how

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
eu companies could compete against

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
global rivals in a way that is why it is

35
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,040
also very important to elaborate

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,520
um the areas where to invest in and if

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
we want to boost the tech

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,520
capabilities in a way we we have to

39
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,399
think about

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,880
what could be the best uh areas on that

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,600
side

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,520
but however besides that the european

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,040
union has been

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
coming up with new regulations such as

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,079
dsa

46
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,119
or tma that raises a question whether

47
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,760
eu by regulating big tech companies is

48
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,560
actually

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,959
setting global standards for the rest of

50
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:15,680
the world

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
or at the same time there could be a

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,800
question are we

53
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,040
actually stopping innovation here so

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,640
we're going to elaborate on different

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,440
topics today

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
what are the next steps we need to take

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,800
to design and establish

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
functional and of course also forward

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,400
thinking systems

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
uh of of regulating that heavy weights

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,080
and unknown of course sensors

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280

to the virtual studio as well but now

140
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,759
not to waste any more time on just the

141
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,840
introduction side here um

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,240
let's go for the first question here so

143
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,759
there is a clear willingness and why

144
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,600
political support in the european union

145
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,360
come up with the highest and most

146
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,000
outstanding

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,759
standards when we talk about tech

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,479
regulations uh the eu has introduced

149
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,360
also as

150
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
part of the beginning the digital

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
service act and of course also digital

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
market act in a way

153
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,120
so to start with what are the three most

154
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,080
essential problems

155
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,479
these regulations are able to solve and

156
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,720
i would actually start with oliver um so

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
all the way for you

158
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,479
oh thank you thank you very much and

159
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,800
thank you thank you for the invite

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,759
um well the the two so we have two texts

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,199
that you just said

162
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
and one is about uh

163
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,600
keeping a market fair open

164
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,080
competitive and prone to innovation that

165
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
is the digital market act

166
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,919
because you know the accelerating

167
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,759
digitization of society

168
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,080
and and the economy has created a

169
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,759
situation where a few very large

170
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,520
platforms control very important

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,880
ecosystems

172
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
and they can deploy what we call network

173
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,919
effects very

174
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,680
very quickly um so they have emerged as

175
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,479
gatekeepers as we call them which means

176
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,919
that they control

177
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,720
uh the access of their markets but also

178
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
neighboring and adjacent markets

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
by their competitors so you know in a

180
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,880
world they they can act as private rule

181
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
makers

182
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,199
and of course uh that's not good that's

183
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,160
not good for

184
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
innovation in particular uh so that's

185
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,520
that's the the first set of

186
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,639
perturbations

187
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,520
and that mainly the digital market act

188
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,000
now

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,120
the digital uh services act

190
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
is everything that is not strictly

191
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,199
speaking competition of course it's

192
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,639
linked to competition

193
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,520
but it's not it's not competition trade

194
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,560
on exchange of

195
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,520
illegal goods services and content

196
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,599
online

197
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,800
is the misuse of services online by

198
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,599
manipulative algorithmic systems

199
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,199
to amplify the spread of this

200
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,280
information uh

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
et cetera so a number of new challenges

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,560
uh

203
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,800
and the way uh platforms should address

204
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,599
them

205
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,639
uh with an effort to responsibilize uh

206
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,919
the platform so that

207
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,960
uh uh actually are uh are

208
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,639
are key to into uh having a safer better

209
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,680
uh uh internet and of course an

210
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,800
additional challenge

211
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
is uh uh to keep the regulations

212
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,319
flexible

213
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,919
that uh keeps innovation uh uh going

214
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,160
and is future proof uh in order to

215
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
create a stable

216
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
unpredictable regulatory environment

217
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,680
that is necessary for firms

218
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,360
so thank you for the overview and and

219
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
the same question actually i would ask

220
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,840
for one or so

221
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,759
all the way to new york right now uh

222
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,919
what are the problems that we're solving

223
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,319
by

224
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,560
by implementing these regulations

225
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
uh so thank you annette and delighted to

226
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,879
be here so i think i completely agree

227
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,520
with how

228
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,080
olivier described the core of these

229
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,039
proposals

230
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
but maybe just to elaborate that there

231
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
are a couple of existing

232
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,960
problems that we have had in enforcing

233
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,879
regulations in the eu

234
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,199
against these tech companies and these

235
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
new proposed regulations are meant to

236
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
resolve them so first problem is that

237
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,640
these investigations that the commission

238
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
has taken to date

239
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
against companies such as google they

240
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
take a long time

241
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,159
and the markets are moving very fast so

242
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,399
here we are giving new tools

243
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,279
to the eu regulators to ex-ante

244
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,200
intervene with a more regulatory

245
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,040
approach so the idea is that we can be

246
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,480
much more effective

247
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,959
in targeting these problems before they

248
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:53,760
really get

249
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
entrenched in the marketplace so that

250
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,959
they're very hard to

251
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,760
reserve reverse um so that's one thing

252
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,519
the second problem that we have dealt

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:01,839
with

254
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,560
is that often regulation targets

255
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,440
differently

256
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,320
large companies and and small companies

257
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
in terms of their effect

258
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,160
so something that might be very feasible

259
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,920
for a large tech company

260
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,560
to comply with can be very burdensome

261
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,880
for small and medium-sized companies

262
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,279
that was one of the criticisms of the

263
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,000
general data

264
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
protection regulation that in many ways

265
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
it was only entrenching

266
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,480
the power of big tech because they were

267
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
the companies that were able to afford

268
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,600
to comply

269
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,720
so now with the dsa and the dma

270
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,120
the regulatory approach is distinctly

271
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
asymmetrical

272
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,640
meaning we are giving more burden some

273
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
applications to companies

274
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,760
that are able to comply with them and

275
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,839
that also have a greater impact in the

276
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,240
marketplace

277
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
thank you for for your responses for

278
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
here hendrick do you

279
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,959
want to add something as well look i

280
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:57,839
think uh

281
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,040
both anu and olivier have been you know

282
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,959
correct and clear in their explanations

283
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:03,519
of what

284
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,560
both the dsa and the dna are trying to

285
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,600
solve in terms of problems uh from a

286
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,959
technical perspective

287
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,880
um you know one one thing that i would

288
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,720
add it's clear that the european

289
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,480
commission believes that

290
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,720
uh there's a market access problem that

291
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,640
needs to be solved in digital markets

292
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,640
and that uh large platform owners

293
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,240
are creating bottlenecks for smaller

294
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,279
digital firms to access the marketplace

295
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,320
there are quote unquote gatekeepers

296
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
and you know i think that this may be

297
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,959
true to a certain extent for certain

298
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:39,839
gatekeepers

299
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,640
uh for certain operators of uh digital

300
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,680
platforms

301
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,440
for others uh i find it more difficult

302
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,560
to to see as a real problem uh

303
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,000
if you take the example of the company

304
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,680
that i work for apple

305
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
we operate a large platform called the

306
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,680
app store

307
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,160
we have 1.8 million apps on the app

308
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,040
store

309
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
and you know part of our business model

310
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
is to ensure that we have as many as

311
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,800
uh quality apps that are safe secure and

312
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,839
privacy

313
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
uh centric applications on our app store

314
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,959
because

315
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,040
it will make our devices more successful

316
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
and we'll have better consumer

317
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,560
experience and richer experience if we

318
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,760
have more apps so

319
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,959
you know for for for some of those uh

320
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,279
objectives the problems for my

321
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,320
perspective

322
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,560
certainly for a company perspective

323
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,519
apple it's

324
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
are less or less are less realistic and

325
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,240
then what i would also add if i can i

326
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,800
think

327
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,440
also there's an underlying political

328
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
problem

329
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,560
that europe is trying to address which

330
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,240
is by by setting

331
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,240
the global standard the ambition of

332
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,160
setting the global standard for platform

333
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,279
regulation

334
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,519
i think uh europe wants to try to

335
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,839
contribute to achieving greater digital

336
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,880
sovereignty

337
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
uh because if it if it is able to set

338
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,560
the global standard

339
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,360
it means that others will have to comply

340
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,880
with that standard

341
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
and that therefore european values that

342
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
are included

343
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,639
in those in those european uh

344
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,079
regulations will be

345
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,040
will be decided uh in europe and and and

346
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,120
so decisions will be not taken

347
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,040
outside of europe so i think there's

348
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,120
this underlying political objective as

349
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,760
well

350
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
yeah we're going to come back to that

351
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,839
whether the rest of the world is going

352
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,399
to be

353
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,399
uh taking over the regulations by the

354
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,160
european union as well a little later

355
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,600
but i would actually continue with you

356
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,120
hendrick here because uh i have a

357
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,399
question especially regarding your

358
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,120
representing

359
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,839
apple here so we know that the big debt

360
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,760
companies face yearly checks on how they

361
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
are tackling

362
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
illegal content under the new rules by

363
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,560
the european commission in a way

364
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,320
and and right and different kind of

365
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
large fines and breakups are threatening

366
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
uh in case big their companies are known

367
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,839
compliance

368
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,399
and in case of companies refused to buy

369
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,000
um they could have

370
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
to hand over up to 10 percent of their

371
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
turnover

372
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,680
as a representative rapport and could

373
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,279
you eva evaluate

374
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,360
the impressiveness of these measures

375
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
well you know let me let me start by

376
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
saying that of course

377
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,560
you know fines and remedies whether

378
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,000
they're structural or behavioral

379
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,880
remedies are

380
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,000
of course very important factors uh

381
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,240
that will contribute without a doubt to

382
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,839
achieving the stated goals of those

383
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,920
regulations but they're not

384
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,079
novel features i mean competition law

385
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,760
today

386
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
allows for the ability to impose fines

387
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,279
to impose these types of remedies

388
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,680
privacy legislation as well to a lesser

389
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,440
extent but

390
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
you still have enforcement mechanisms uh

391
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,399
and so the dsa and the dma in particular

392
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,320
also have enforcement mechanisms and

393
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,519
fines which is

394
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,560
not very uh novel what i think the the

395
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,680
real novelty

396
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,880
uh lies in the dma the digital markets

397
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,000
act which proposes

398
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,959
an ex ante approach uh it basically

399
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,880
stands for the proposition

400
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
uh that uh certain conduct uh

401
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
by platforms uh is is illegal uh

402
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,360
and it creates basically a shortcut for

403
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,800
public authorities

404
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
to decide which one should be allowed

405
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,079
and which one shouldn't be allowed i

406
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,320
mean the traditional approach is that

407
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,279
one should first determine that uh a

408
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,760
company has significant market power

409
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
uh that it has durable market power

410
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,000
dominance that allows its to

411
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,560
you know operate to a significant extent

412
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,920
independently from its

413
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,480
consumers and customers you know public

414
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,680
authorities won't have to do that

415
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,440
anymore under the dma

416
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,079
uh secondly uh there won't be a need to

417
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,839
determine whether or not the conduct in

418
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,880
question

419
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,480
uh constitutes uh you know or risks

420
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
excluding competitors

421
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,160
uh or or abusing uh consumers

422
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,959
or exploiting consumers that's you know

423
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,120
a given that's predetermined and last

424
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,720
but not least it certainly

425
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
does not require the public authorities

426
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,000
to determine whether they're

427
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,519
countervailing

428
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,040
justifications or efficiencies economic

429
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,240
efficiencies or non-economic

430
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
efficiencies that would

431
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
warrant in specific cases not

432
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,639
uh imposing specific obligations and so

433
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
that's really the novelty and it really

434
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,560
stands for the proposition

435
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,000
uh and at that uh you know legislators

436
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,199
because it's now in the hands of the

437
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,360
legislators that legislators have gained

438
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,560
sufficient

439
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,279
knowledge which is experienced in these

440
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,399
complex diverse and very dynamic markets

441
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,000
that they can actually in advance codify

442
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
which behavior is appropriate which

443
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,759
behavior is not appropriate and i find

444
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,560
that

445
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
you know a a um a a a

446
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,839
a difficult working hypothesis so i'll

447
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,199
stop there thank you

448
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,519
okay thank you um but but speaking of

449
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,880
from the citizens

450
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,199
perspective here uh a survey released in

451
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,880
the year of 2019

452
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,600
um stated that 74 of the european

453
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,279
citizens would want to know more

454
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,600
how their data is used by social media

455
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,120
platforms when they access

456
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,079
other websites uh concerns over the data

457
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,240
and its protection has grown drastically

458
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,920
in recent years that's what we all know

459
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,560
here

460
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
um how has the european commission

461
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,320
addressed these trends and i would ask

462
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,199
this question from oliver

463
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,880
well thank you well let me first maybe

464
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,959
react to what rick just said

465
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,120
um so that will make it a bit more fun i

466
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,399
mean uh

467
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,000
it just describes the difference between

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,079
competition law and uh

469
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,639
and regulatory policy i mean there's the

470
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,279
the

471
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
the very essence of of an exante

472
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,839
regulation

473
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,519
in particular in consumer protection

474
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,959
field or

475
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,880
fair trading is that you you tell

476
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,160
companies what they can

477
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,560
not do uh and in this case what they

478
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,920
cannot do

479
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,839
uh is actually that's why there is a

480
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,600
relatively limited list of

481
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,600
of things they cannot do and it's based

482
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,880
on 20 years of

483
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,360
decision practice of the commission and

484
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,720
the case laws of the

485
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
uh uh okay sorry uh

486
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,279
cases in the in court uh so this

487
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,839
these are practices from which we know

488
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,280
that when they are implemented

489
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
by uh large platforms with a gatekeeper

490
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,119
function

491
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,280
are invariably detrimental to to

492
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,559
consumers

493
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,640
uh so from the point of view of citizens

494
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
that is quite that is quite relevant

495
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,640
uh for for the rest uh

496
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
there is a common understanding around

497
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
the world that there is a need for

498
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,559
uh balanced regulation that ensures that

499
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,160
citizens and business

500
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,360
can benefit equally from the

501
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,960
opportunities offered by the digital

502
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,080
economy and

503
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,440
we did not yet address the draft bills

504
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,240
that are

505
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,679
now in front of the us congress because

506
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,120
to take to borrow the there was a

507
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
hendrick i guess the congress also

508
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,080
felt confident enough to be able to to

509
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,000
table quite far-reaching proposal and in

510
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,640
some ways

511
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,799
more far-reaching than what we have

512
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,760
proposed

513
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,440
here in uh in europe uh the protection

514
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,520
of users privacy

515
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,559
for example key principle it has guided

516
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,760
action over the past years in the gdpr

517
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
and it is true that to a large extent

518
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,679
for the gdpr we have

519
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,720
set a global standard but

520
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,919
that's not the objective the objective

521
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,520
now our objective is not to rule the

522
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,640
world

523
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,320
uh maybe others have this objective but

524
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,400
that's not ours our objective

525
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,679
is to protect our citizens

526
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,440
uh and uh have a legal system

527
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
which offers the digital ecosystems the

528
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,280
opportunity to grow

529
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,320
innovate uh while respecting uh

530
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
european uh value

531
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
so and that's what we're trying to do

532
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
here we're trying to complement

533
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,280
the existing framework data protection

534
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,440
laws for example transparency

535
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,559
applications on

536
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
deep consumer profiling will help inform

537
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,240
gdpr enforcement

538
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,160
whereas mandatory opt-out for data

539
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,280
combination across

540
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,160
core platform services supplements the

541
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
existing level of protection under the

542
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,799
gdpr

543
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,039
so you have a lot of cross uh

544
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,240
relationship

545
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,440
with uh are here to actually address

546
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,559
very deep concerns uh as your

547
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,200
paul showed within within eu citizens

548
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,720
yeah thanks for thanks for bringing it

549
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,400
up also the

550
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,320
comparison to regarding the gdpr

551
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,000
regulations as well because we know that

552
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,679
thanks to gdpr regulations which was

553
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,400
already

554
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,960
introduced in the year 2018 the u.s

555
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,000
citizens had

556
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
a stronger right to decide what big debt

557
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
companies can do with their

558
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,400
information and personal data and and

559
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,320
this also inspired by many other

560
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,960
lawmakers from all across the words to

561
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,799
make changes in their systems as well

562
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,480
we have a couple of examples regarding

563
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,960
from brazil from australia

564
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
and this also has raised the strongest

565
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,000
discussions

566
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
on a data protection in the u.s and as

567
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,200
anu you are based in new york city um do

568
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
you think that the same effect would

569
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
also happen

570
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
uh this time with the dsa and and the uh

571
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,039
the

572
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,520
uh dma uh regulations as well uh the

573
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
different lawmakers from other countries

574
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,000
uh

575
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,760
are going to make some changes in their

576
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,400
systems too

577
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,840
yeah so let's uh be clear on uh how the

578
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,919
eu has been so effective

579
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,880
in making the gdpr the global standard

580
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,799
and i agree with olivier that it is not

581
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,280
for the

582
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
intention to rule the world the eu has

583
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,240
been very confident in laying out a

584
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,320
regulatory approach that serves

585
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,280
the european citizens and internet users

586
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,280
and at the same time when doing so

587
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
when it has been regulating the

588
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
companies and their privacy standards

589
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,120
these companies have made

590
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,520
a voluntary decision in line with their

591
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,640
business interests

592
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,760
often to extend the european rule across

593
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,039
their global

594
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,080
practices so in that sense only

595
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,480
by regulating the single market the eu

596
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,919
has been able to sit back

597
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,559
and let the companies then transpose the

598
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,960
european standard across the global uh

599
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,000
marketplace so

600
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,200
that's why apple has the european gdpr

601
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
as its global privacy standard the same

602
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,520
goes for google

603
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,880
facebook microsoft so whether this would

604
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,280
then

605
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,799
happen uh in the dma and dsa context

606
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,559
i would say that there are many reasons

607
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,159
why i would expect at least

608
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,480
partial brussels effect to touch these

609
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
regulations as well

610
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
first of all the world in which the eu

611
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,159
is now introducing these regulations has

612
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,320
shifted already towards the european

613
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:28,960
norms

614
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,760
so compared to the time when the gdpr

615
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
was released i think there was

616
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
less of a refined understanding around

617
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,559
the world

618
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,520
how much these companies business models

619
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,080
depend

620
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,120
on data often very privacy infringing

621
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,600
ways of gaining access to data tracking

622
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
their consumers

623
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,360
online and compromising in many ways the

624
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,080
personal

625
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
uh autonomy and and privacy of the

626
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,679
individuals

627
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,799
so there's a lot more willingness to to

628
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,120
focus on what the eu is doing with the

629
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,799
understanding that the eu

630
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,080
is uh often the trailblazer and the one

631
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
with the most ambitious standard

632
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
and with the capacity then to often set

633
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
the standards globally

634
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,240
so i think there are the companies are

635
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,320
watching what the eu is doing

636
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,799
also considering when it is in their

637
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,360
entrance

638
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,400
uh to implement any of the changes

639
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,280
uh caused by the dma and dsa across the

640
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,559
global marketplace

641
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,000
but then we also have foreign

642
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,080
governments who are increasingly

643
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
responding to the demand of these

644
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,960
citizens

645
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
to also offer a more robust regulatory

646
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,600
framework so i think we will see this at

647
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,559
two levels

648
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,280
we will see some of these practices by

649
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,559
the corporations

650
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,559
big tech companies to be implemented

651
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,840
globally there will be more

652
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,960
accountability

653
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,200
more algorithmic transparency but we

654
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,280
will also see the governments in

655
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,799
different parts of the world

656
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,799
including in the united states the

657
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,159
conversation is really

658
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,960
shifting in the u.s when it comes to the

659
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,320
harms of the big tech

660
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,559
and the need for the regulators to be

661
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,159
more interventionist

662
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,640
so i also see much more demand on the

663
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,520
u.s side

664
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,280
to start following the european

665
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,360
regulatory approach

666
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,440
and thank you i know um now now

667
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,799
switching over to

668
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,520
a topic of regulating ai which was also

669
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
one of the topics of our conversation

670
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,159
here today

671
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,520
we know that the european commission is

672
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,679
also working on a plan of regulating the

673
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,960
use of ai

674
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,640
more and more tech companies and also

675
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
some of the states also

676
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,120
where i come from estonia is using ai

677
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,840
solutions

678
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,559
ai based solutions technology already

679
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:32,880
for

680
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,360
quite some time for offering services to

681
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,280
the customers and and also the citizens

682
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,000
aspect

683
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,320
um do you think that the new rules in

684
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,919
regulating the use of ai

685
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,080
are some ways stopping the innovation

686
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,679
and and most of these regulations are

687
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,000
not even being fully approved yet

688
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,240
aren't we a little bit too late already

689
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
by regulating the use of ai

690
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,159
in in some of the places maybe the

691
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,520
question could be for oliver

692
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,320
yeah well thank you um well too early or

693
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,200
too late it's

694
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,080
uh it's always the problem of every

695
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,880
regulator

696
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,000
uh too early stifle innovation too late

697
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
uh damage might have happened uh so that

698
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,000
that's that's always

699
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,279
an issue but the reason why we're

700
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,520
putting rules in place uh for new

701
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,559
technologies is

702
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,080
is to tackle any concerns but also

703
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,240
in terms of business opportunities

704
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,080
mistrust that people might have

705
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,240
and you know once the mistress is there

706
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,799
uh it becomes very difficult to regain

707
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,000
the confidence of

708
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,080
of the consumers it's also good for

709
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,240
people uh that's my message

710
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,480
uh i will also we want also to give

711
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,400
clarity and predictability

712
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,640
um to to to all involved and in

713
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,720
particular companies

714
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,159
so ai is no doubt a strategic technology

715
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,039
it involves tremendous opportunities but

716
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,320
some of its uses

717
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,679
pose very specific risks uh that

718
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,159
relate to the application of various eu

719
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,679
rules

720
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,159
designed to ensure safety designed to

721
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,480
protect fundamental rights and value

722
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,880
so with this initiatives what we we want

723
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,760
to do

724
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,480
is try to ensure that ai is developed

725
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,840
and used in a

726
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,320
legal framework with the overall goal to

727
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,400
stimulate the tech up

728
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,360
of trustworthy ai in in our single

729
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,919
market

730
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,799
so concretely the proposed uh the

731
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,640
proposal

732
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,279
proposes limited or no regulation for ai

733
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,720
systems

734
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,279
when they pose minimal or no risk and

735
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,120
that is the case for the overwhelming

736
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
majority

737
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,360
but the proposal bans uh systems that

738
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
pose an ex

739
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,919
unacceptable risks uh for example toys

740
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,600
using voice assistance

741
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,520
that encourage dangerous behavior of

742
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,840
minors of miners sorry

743
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,559
or systems that allow social scoring by

744
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,760
governments

745
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,240
this will be banned in the in the in the

746
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,600
eu

747
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,320
and and we also plan to impose strict

748
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,679
requirements

749
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,559
on systems that pose a high risk uh let

750
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,240
me just take an example

751
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,080
ai application in robot assisted surgery

752
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,640
well i i think we have a duty to to to

753
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
impose extra safety

754
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,760
on uh on this type of uh of

755
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,200
application so of course there is more

756
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,320
than one way to get

757
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,799
uh to get the balance right but this is

758
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,919
really about

759
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,600
getting the balance right between

760
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,960
building trust

761
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,000
and increasing uptake on the one hand uh

762
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,559
versus

763
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,960
fostering innovation on the other hand

764
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,679
and uh

765
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,600
we believe we we struck the the best

766
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
balance we could

767
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,840
do but whatever a follow-up question to

768
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,360
you as well here is that do you think

769
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,080
that we should

770
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,799
raise awareness of ai in the european

771
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,559
union in a way because we have had these

772
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,559
discussions a lot because people

773
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,200
mistake the eai still like even in the

774
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,400
year of 2001

775
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,039
uh 2021. so do you think we should have

776
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,320
any kind of uh

777
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,799
i don't know projects or initiatives

778
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,960
again uh to raise the public awareness

779
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,840
of the ai

780
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,600
well i don't know i mean i think people

781
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,159
people have a pretty good idea what ai

782
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,679
is

783
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,080
um i'm not sure how successful an

784
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,760
awareness freezing campaign

785
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,960
would be i mean i i think

786
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,200
generally what the average citizens

787
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
wants and wants to benefit from all the

788
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,840
uh

789
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,720
uh increased wealth and choice and

790
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,120
quality of new services that it uh

791
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,440
involves but it doesn't want this

792
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,240
privacy

793
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,120
uh to be to be to be at stake or at

794
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,559
least not

795
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,960
in a way that is sort of kind of

796
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
involuntary

797
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,440
and he certainly wants that obligations

798
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,799
that are

799
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,880
life-risking or potentially go against

800
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,360
core criminal regulations are either

801
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,039
banned or strictly controlled i think

802
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,919
this is

803
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,880
this is the debates we we must uh have

804
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,640
rather than a generic debate on what

805
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
ai is thank you um

806
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,600
we have already received a couple of

807
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,919
questions also from our audience and i

808
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,200
would encourage everyone

809
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,360
uh you have a chance to ask questions or

810
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,200
if anybody here in the room wants to ask

811
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,399
a question raise your hand

812
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,840
you will be welcome to you to join us

813
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,640
here um so one of the questions that

814
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,000
is kind of interesting that we have

815
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
received from uh from someone from our

816
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
listeners today

817
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,799
uh when and why the european union wants

818
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,399
to regulate mobile phone uh

819
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,159
manufacturers to implement

820
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,679
one common usb charger cable for every

821
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:28,960
brand

822
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,799
who wants to to go and answer that

823
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,399
oliver you uh hendrik well i have no

824
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:36,960
idea

825
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,360
i i just recall i died of general for

826
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
competition but i'm happy to ask my

827
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,559
colleague in charge of standardization

828
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,760
henrik any comments from that no i think

829
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,440
there have been calls in the european

830
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,039
union for

831
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,240
uh regulating uh the so-called common

832
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,039
charges for

833
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,880
mobile devices um you know i'm

834
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,679
not aware of what the latest statuses of

835
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,559
those

836
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:07,279
uh initiatives i would just add that i

837
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,640
think that it's the

838
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,279
you know an important role for

839
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,000
policymakers

840
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,799
and legislators is to set out what the

841
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,559
objectives ought to be

842
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,080
for manufacturers in terms of achieving

843
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,480
environmental standards environmental

844
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,520
footprints

845
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,720
but i would caution against politicians

846
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,200
and regulators and legislators to decide

847
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,399
which specific technology manufacturers

848
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,679
should be using

849
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,120
in the marketplace i think these are

850
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,000
decisions that are better left to

851
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,200
engineers and and market participants uh

852
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,000
but again i'm

853
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,080
i frankly i'm not sure what the uh what

854
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,440
the current status is of

855
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,520
of of the proposal and i know that there

856
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,600
are people that are thinking about

857
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,480
introducing these types of proposals so

858
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,600
i'll stop

859
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
thank you um so there's another question

860
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,720
from uh from our

861
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,960
uh one of our um our listeners anyway

862
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,919
um so will the will the newly uh created

863
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,240
standards uh contractual clauses be a

864
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,080
sufficient tool for comply

865
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,799
with the conclusions of streams too

866
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,679
who would like to take that one here

867
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,279
any comments from i know oliver

868
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,279
well i don't know i talked a lot so

869
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,799
maybe i knew and then i'm happy to

870
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,120
compliment a few words

871
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,720
i am happy to weigh in and just to

872
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,279
remind of the listeners who may not be

873
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,120
familiar with the ins and outs of the

874
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,440
history of the data transfers between

875
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,080
the united

876
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,120
states and the eu is that there has been

877
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,039
a a specific agreement negotiated by the

878
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,120
u.s and the eu government to facilitate

879
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,440
the

880
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
data flows and to respond to the

881
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,200
concerns that the europeans have

882
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,360
that the americans don't sufficiently

883
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,240
guarantee

884
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,080
the protection of the privacy of the

885
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,440
european data

886
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,320
but these uh agreements negotiated have

887
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,120
been invalidated not just once by but

888
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,320
twice by the the highest european court

889
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,600
so we have a tremendous pressure to find

890
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,480
a way to

891
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
restore those data flows that are

892
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,559
fundamentally important for both

893
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,200
the united states and uh the european

894
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,000
economy

895
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,240
but i will i i would be too quick to try

896
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,519
to conclude that now

897
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,120
something is sufficient because the

898
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,120
history shows that the european court

899
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,720
will hold these agreements

900
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,279
to an extremely high standard but what

901
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,440
we do see that there is a political

902
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,480
agreement both

903
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,960
in the u.s and the the eu that something

904
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
needs to be done the negotiations have

905
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,159
been accelerated

906
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,080
and there's a genuine attempt to find a

907
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,360
solution that both

908
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,399
serves their dire business needs but

909
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,039
also

910
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,159
take seriously uh the fundamental rights

911
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,360
uh protections

912
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,760
nobody wants a third case from the

913
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,399
european court of justice that yet again

914
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,640
will invalidate those data flows there's

915
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,399
enough legal uncertainty

916
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,720
but i am optimistic that given the

917
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
importance of these issues

918
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,559
it will be elevated in salience and

919
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,159
priority

920
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,200
thank you anna um so so moving over

921
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,600
here so it has been discussed uh very

922
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,159
widely uh why most of the global

923
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,200
giants have not chosen european union

924
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,399
are you as as their home market has it

925
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,159
anything to do with regulations or

926
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,279
what's the reason

927
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,159
why the very big tech companies have not

928
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,240
chosen the european union astr

929
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,799
home in a way maybe hendrick you would

930
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,880
like to take that one

931
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,919
sure so um i

932
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,039
i don't think uh regulation

933
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,320
is a key factor as to why there are

934
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,480
virtually no uh

935
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,880
successful global tech players that are

936
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,799
of european origin

937
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,600
um i mean it probably plays the role but

938
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,559
frankly

939
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,000
you know the reality is that today

940
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
digital technology is changing our lives

941
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,320
it's changing our society

942
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,960
and so let me be very clear i think it's

943
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,640
totally legitimate and appropriate and

944
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,760
necessary

945
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,799
for policymakers regulators legislators

946
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,960
to make sure that

947
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,039
that they have the right tools

948
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,200
instruments that are fit for purpose

949
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,600
to ensure that their citizens and their

950
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,159
companies can leverage the opportunities

951
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,640
of of uh digital technologies and

952
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,159
protect them from the risk

953
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,919
that sometimes derives from digital

954
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,440
technology so

955
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,840
there's as such and of itself i think

956
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,799
nothing

957
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,240
uh inappropriate uh or abnormal

958
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
on the contrary to wanting to make sure

959
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,919
that there's regulation in place

960
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,919
the the difficulty is making sure that

961
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,600
the regulation is the right regulation

962
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,279
that's appropriate regulation and

963
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,960
and i think if you want to you know

964
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
export regulation as a rulemaker you

965
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,240
want to make sure that

966
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,039
it does uh protect consumer it does

967
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,799
protect privacy rights

968
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,360
and uh the dma in this respect i think

969
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,480
is uh

970
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,240
is open to criticism as it's being

971
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
proposed having said that

972
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,360
uh what makes uh companies

973
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,880
decide to uh invest

974
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,519
in in a specific country to become a

975
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,000
global

976
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,239
player i think these are uh you know

977
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,040
very

978
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,918
uh critical uh questions and you know i

979
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,000
can think of a number one number one is

980
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,159
access to venture capital and in order

981
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,679
to have access to venture capital you

982
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,440
have to have very well functioning

983
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,679
capital markets i think the european

984
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,359
union needs to work on that

985
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,639
secondly uh investment uh

986
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,480
europe is working on investment we have

987
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,280
a an unprecedented 750 billion

988
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,159
recovery plan 20 of it 30 of it is

989
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,280
dedicated to

990
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,839
to digital which is great thirdly

991
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,040
digital skills

992
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,440
there's a huge digital skills gaps that

993
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,639
europe can address

994
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,399
and last but not least i think europe

995
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,918
needs to continue to working on the

996
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,599
digital single market and this is where

997
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,399
regulation can play a very positive role

998
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:50,960
in

999
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
eliminating barriers to trade and

1000
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,199
investment that exists as a result of

1001
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,960
different legal regimes in europe

1002
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,320
and so in a way regulation can help

1003
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,680
innovation can help also ensuring that

1004
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,640
uh uh digital players in europe become

1005
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,280
more successful on a global basis

1006
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,200
uh also i would pull up the same

1007
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,640
question to either how to get

1008
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,880
european uh how to get very big debt

1009
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,680
companies

1010
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,240
to set up their headquarters to europe

1011
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,599
how do you attract

1012
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,520
uh um like the big companies

1013
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,720
to me yes okay

1014
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,440
well first of all i agree entirely with

1015
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,280
what enriquez said

1016
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,160
um well and it's not a question of

1017
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,560
attracting really i mean you know

1018
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,119
people tends to establish where they're

1019
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,480
from

1020
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,560
so if your steep job why on earth would

1021
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
you incorporate

1022
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,280
april in the eu were you very fine in

1023
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,200
california and you have everything you

1024
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,599
need you have indeed the capital markets

1025
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,480
you have

1026
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,359
uh the skills you have the working

1027
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:56,000
capital

1028
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,119
you have everything in it so the

1029
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,079
question

1030
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,240
for for the for the eu is how do you

1031
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,680
uh create the conditions

1032
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,640
that make that the the next apple will

1033
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,079
be european

1034
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,640
and uh it's not so much a question of

1035
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,359
innovation

1036
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,520
because we do have innovation but the

1037
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,200
problem is that when these innovators

1038
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,520
need to move to the higher scale

1039
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,160
they do not find the financing so risk

1040
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,480
capital venture capital and that's why

1041
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,200
we have

1042
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,720
launched this capital market union

1043
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,240
project in europe

1044
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,560
uh that that didn't go fast enough and

1045
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,640
they're still not going fast enough

1046
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,000
uh it is because when the uh uh

1047
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,640
the companies these innovators needs to

1048
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,839
reach the capital mass

1049
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,880
to to become true world players well

1050
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,560
they usually cross the atlantic because

1051
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,640
this is where they get financed

1052
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,359
i mean moderna take vaccines moderna is

1053
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,520
a great successory of the us

1054
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,800
except it's a bunch of marseille france

1055
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,599
based scientists but when they needed 5

1056
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,320
billion

1057
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,760
the only place on earth where they could

1058
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,599
find it was in the u.s so they moved to

1059
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,200
the u.s

1060
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,359
very good for the u.s very bad for us

1061
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,119
spotify

1062
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,000
and you would have many other success

1063
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,800
stories

1064
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,960
like this and this is because at some

1065
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,480
point you need to go where you find the

1066
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,240
capital to finance you

1067
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,079
skills of course very important as well

1068
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,640
and all the other factors that uh

1069
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,320
that uh eric mentioned regulation

1070
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,359
in my view definitely not a deterrent

1071
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,480
uh one really well used actually

1072
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,520
an attractivity factor in my view thank

1073
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,160
you

1074
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,760
um we have received a question from

1075
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,280
lucia on our

1076
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,560
um like up and in slido

1077
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,200
so will the eu and u.s with all the

1078
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
strong regulations be able to compete

1079
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,599
with global powers such as china

1080
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:51,920
given the fact then this uh disclosure

1081
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,800
that uh

1082
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,160
data is the new oil

1083
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,839
what i know

1084
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:10,960
i just want to mention the earlier

1085
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,119
conversation by olivia and hendrick was

1086
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,800
fundamentally important so if i could

1087
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,280
just add one more dimension to that

1088
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,880
because this idea that we're always

1089
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,320
speeding regulation

1090
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,119
as being uh can it be an enabler for

1091
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,960
innovation or is it really an enemy of

1092
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,400
innovation i think it can be a very

1093
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,680
harmful conversation

1094
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
so i just want to reinforce the

1095
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,880
important message that henrik and

1096
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,839
olivier

1097
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:33,760
were saying of the importance of

1098
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,440
understanding that if we can through

1099
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,400
regulation

1100
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,200
create a more robust and harmonized

1101
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,640
digital single market

1102
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,960
we have a very different foundation for

1103
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,800
innovation but what we do need

1104
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
is an integrated capital markets you

1105
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,040
need to be able to raise the funds to

1106
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,119
grow those innovations and that is

1107
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,320
absolutely a key

1108
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,839
and then to pick up on one thing and i

1109
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,440
think it feeds a little bit to the next

1110
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,560
question as well

1111
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
olivia say the innovators normally

1112
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,079
establish where they come from

1113
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,560
but think about where do these big tech

1114
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,400
executive giants come from

1115
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,480
so if you think about steve jobs is a

1116
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,000
son of a syrian immigrant

1117
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,880
jeff bezos is a second generation cuban

1118
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,760
sergey brin

1119
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,920
is from russia elon musk is from south

1120
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,880
africa it is not all homegrown talent in

1121
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,000
the united states

1122
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,640
so europe also needs to be the magnet

1123
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
for talent and the destination that

1124
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,280
attracts the best minds and innovators

1125
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
and i would use that as a segway to this

1126
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,880
great question that we got from the

1127
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,680
audience

1128
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,240
is that who wins these races is where

1129
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,400
that innovation where the best minds

1130
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,200
want to

1131
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,320
migrate to and want to innovate and in

1132
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,280
many ways

1133
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,760
america has been the place that has

1134
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
generated the ecosystem

1135
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,320
the universities the capital markets

1136
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,560
that they're being welcoming of migrants

1137
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,960
um that many ways the eu needs to

1138
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,000
replicate those

1139
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,400
first of all but then to be able to

1140
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
compete against china

1141
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,920
i think there was a wonderful line at

1142
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,079
some point when the eu

1143
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,839
got some pressure the commission from

1144
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,160
france and germany that we would need to

1145
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,200
turn towards industrial policy to better

1146
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,560
compete with china

1147
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,319
and commissioner festark has said that

1148
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,560
look let the chinese be chinese

1149
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,640
we would be lousy chinese they are much

1150
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,760
better at it

1151
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
and ultimately that would be the most

1152
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,880
dangerous path

1153
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,800
for the eu to take is to choose

1154
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,520
protectionism build a fortress europe

1155
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,000
turned this idea of digital sovereignty

1156
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,280
that hendrick was talked

1157
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,599
uh talked about to this kind of

1158
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,280
instrumental protectionism

1159
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,839
that will not be a path to victory but

1160
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,160
the eu needs to assert itself

1161
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,640
true to its values because it is really

1162
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,599
offering a

1163
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,560
different path than china is absolutely

1164
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,319
uh

1165
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:46,240
disrespectful of the fundamental rights

1166
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,119
of uh individual users and that is the

1167
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,960
price of the chinese model

1168
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
and the europeans cannot and should not

1169
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,800
and will not replicate that

1170
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,359
and in many ways even americans in this

1171
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,160
race

1172
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,079
are second-guessing now these kind of

1173
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,040
techno-libertarian foundations of

1174
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,480
american success

1175
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,800
and our understanding that ultimately

1176
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,040
regulation needs to be part of that

1177
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,200
so in many ways i think the eu is on the

1178
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,960
right track with the values

1179
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,599
underlying the european model of the

1180
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,880
digital economy

1181
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,280
if it remains mindful of some of these

1182
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,000
other issues

1183
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,839
like the capital markets completing the

1184
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:23,200
digital single market

1185
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,800
i'm sorry it was a lengthy answer but

1186
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,560
the question was just very um

1187
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,920
important i thought so thank you for

1188
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,160
that thank you thank you for a very

1189
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,319
insightful answer here too oliver you

1190
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,079
want to add something as well

1191
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,560
no can we move to the next one you know

1192
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,400
including the quotation of uh

1193
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,839
margaret vegeta yes so

1194
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,880
all right we also have received another

1195
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,720
question from the audience

1196
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,520
by romana who has asked that how the

1197
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,760
digital services act package may affect

1198
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,640
the future

1199
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,960
do you think that this could eliminate

1200
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:02,000
some internet threats as well

1201
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,200
henrik maybe no i'm i mean

1202
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,119
that it goes without saying this is the

1203
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,119
objective the the goal of the

1204
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,880
the dsa is to increase responsibility

1205
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,200
for

1206
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,800
digital players as to the content that

1207
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,640
they put online uh

1208
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
it increased also legal certainty for

1209
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,240
digital players to ensure that the

1210
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,359
digital single market works well and i'm

1211
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,160
sure that

1212
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,000
uh there's a number of very important

1213
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,920
guiding principles in the

1214
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,640
in the proposed dsa that will form a

1215
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,680
blueprint

1216
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,480
for other jurisdictions other countries

1217
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,000
around the world to follow it that goes

1218
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,200
without saying and

1219
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,200
you know i i can just add that you know

1220
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,680
from my perspective working for apple

1221
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,880
you know this is something that we're

1222
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,480
very familiar with because we have a

1223
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,839
curated approach

1224
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,319
towards putting content online we have

1225
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,400
you know actual human beings that

1226
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,720
vet third-party applications before we

1227
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,240
put them online to make sure that they

1228
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,119
are legal

1229
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,680
safe secure and and don't infringe on

1230
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,680
the privacy rights of our users

1231
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,960
um so i i'm hopeful that it will

1232
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,040
uh i think you know it's certainly you

1233
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,640
know nothing is ever perfect in any

1234
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,000
proposal that so there's

1235
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,359
always room for improvement but

1236
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,599
generally speaking i'm convinced that it

1237
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,000
would make

1238
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,079
a change and by the way if i can pick up

1239
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:15,760
on the previous question

1240
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,280
i also think this is something that is

1241
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,880
being looked at in the united states and

1242
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,200
i

1243
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,960
therefore think that some type of

1244
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,119
transatlantic cooperation

1245
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,599
on these issues is of extreme importance

1246
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:26,560
because

1247
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,960
the united states and europe do share a

1248
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,079
lot of values

1249
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,720
that perhaps other regions of the world

1250
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,040
do not share to the same extent

1251
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,280
and so you know if we want to be

1252
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,480
successful

1253
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,240
if we want to be successful promoting

1254
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,599
protecting the prosperity of our

1255
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,960
citizens

1256
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,119
i think the europeans but also the

1257
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,720
americans will be much better off if

1258
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,839
they work together

1259
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,720
uh in in establishing these principles

1260
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,160
and the rules that will flow from those

1261
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,359
principles

1262
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,040
absolutely fully agree with you on the

1263
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,640
last point regarding uh transcent

1264
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,680
lattice also

1265
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,400
uh collaboration um as we just have one

1266
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,240
and a half minutes left here um so as

1267
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,839
the very last con

1268
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:05,839
concluding point here a question to

1269
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,839
everybody and i i would

1270
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:11,280
ask a very short answer for that um so

1271
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,319
is the europe european approach is it

1272
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,400
visionary or is it killing helpful

1273
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,319
innovation

1274
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:20,319
let's start from annual and just with

1275
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,680
the one sentence

1276
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,680
as a conclusion i think i was pretty uh

1277
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,000
lengthy in my earlier answer that it is

1278
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,200
both visionary

1279
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,839
and it is not killing innovation but

1280
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:33,920
there are still components that need to

1281
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,880
be put in place

1282
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,760
in order to translate that vision into

1283
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,880
tangible for

1284
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,119
success so i would call for more

1285
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:41,920
ambition

1286
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,760
and more integrated capital markets more

1287
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,200
foreign talent and

1288
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,160
uh maybe that's a good one to start

1289
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,560
oliver your last night

1290
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,520
you're very very same as i knew i will

1291
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,480
add more

1292
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,560
more cooperation between universities

1293
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,599
and business

1294
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,560
i mean it's it's really not the core

1295
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
that is or the vision that is at stake

1296
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,640
it's it's all the ecosystem and it's

1297
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,000
something that you build

1298
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,119
through small steps here and there that

1299
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:09,760
makes that

1300
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,480
uh i mean innovation takes place in in a

1301
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,920
region or it doesn't

1302
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,000
uh companies grow in that region or that

1303
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,960
or they do not

1304
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,800
it's many many things and it has to do

1305
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,800
with capital it has to do with skills

1306
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,240
it has to do with everything that makes

1307
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,160
a successful company uh

1308
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,240
um and the regulation is there as an

1309
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,760
enabler but if you don't have the rest

1310
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,440
it doesn't work

1311
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,640
and closing remarks from hendrick

1312
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,640
i don't think it's uh i think it would

1313
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,000
be overstating

1314
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,079
uh that it's visionary i think you know

1315
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,160
europe is doing what's legitimately and

1316
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,680
should be doing which is to

1317
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,119
you know protect and promote the

1318
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,319
interests and the prosperity of its

1319
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,599
citizens

1320
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,119
i don't would call that visionary i

1321
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,079
would also don't think that the

1322
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:48,960
regulation will

1323
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,680
kill innovation i agree with olivier but

1324
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,920
there are aspects in the proposals that

1325
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,200
would reduce

1326
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,359
uh trust in the system that will reduce

1327
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,960
privacy protections that would reduce

1328
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,400
safety and security

1329
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,200
and you need trust to innovate if people

1330
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,920
stop

1331
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,119
having trust in ecosystems uh you know

1332
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,200
people will be more reluctant to try new

1333
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,599
new new features to download new apps

1334
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,960
and so i think you know

1335
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,119
it's very important that legislators

1336
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,960
today and i'm crossing my fingers that

1337
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,520
they will

1338
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,480
internalize that the the proposals are

1339
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,839
not perfect and that there's room for

1340
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:22,720
improvement to

1341
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,800
to maintain that trust to promote and

1342
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,720
and and encourage further innovation

1343
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,280
yeah

1344
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,960
thank you thank you everyone thanks for

1345
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,640
the panelists and thanks for uh for

1346
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,400
people that has joined us here in the

1347
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:32,880
room

1348
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,680
and also virtually um so i do hope that

1349
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,359
that was interesting panel for you to

1350
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,359
listen to and then there is definitely

1351
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,560
some improvement made by by like making

1352
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,640
this entire approach more visionary

1353
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,960
and attracting more companies to you to

1354
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,400
start their business here

1355
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,040
in in europe but now uh for information

1356
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,720
as well here so coming up in the next

1357
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,480
five minutes here in the same room

1358
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,480
we have a session called climate change

1359
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,920
