2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,599
i expected my first address at this

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,400
conference

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
to take place under different

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,880
circumstances the kovit 19 pandemics

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,840
seems to be affecting everything it's

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,560
impressive

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,039
that you're able to do it because i mean

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,920
everyone is very afraid of taking the

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,000
step

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,840
but we all know this is very important

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,679
and that you can't just do everything

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,880
online because

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,680
particularly politics foreign policy and

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,520
the intellectual world you need to meet

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,200
the people you need to exchange ideas

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,920
you have to

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
keep these networks alive even during

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,520
the pandemic

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,680
to think through what sort of europe is

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,440
going to emerge from the pandemic

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,199
who we are as europeans what do we

23
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,960
identify as common threats what sort of

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,840
common destiny

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
do we perceive for ourselves since this

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,879
crisis is associated

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,079
with many other issues this is not only

28
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,319
the health issue this is also social

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,640
and also the security so therefore i

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,080
welcome this topic at globsec conference

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,920
the good thing about globestack is that

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,760
the range is very wide i'm very

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,119
interested in 5g

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,280
in technology but also geopolitics for

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,119
someone like me who is interested in

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,759
many different things glove sec is ideal

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,080
we have to now focus more on our

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,040
freedoms and

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
liberty and democracy and rule of law

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,640
because even though

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,799
we we have things working online it

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,920
becomes even more

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
essential i mean the freedom of speech

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
but at the same time there is so much

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
this and misinformation going on so

46
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,000
these are

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,600
very very important aspect i think

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,000
we are all on the same page in saying

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,439
that climate change

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,439
matters to our security and that we all

51
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,280
need to do our part to mitigate its

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,119
impact and we all need to do our part to

53
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,280
adapt and be prepared for the changes

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,079
that are coming

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,079
so yes i think based on the conversation

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,079
you can see that the defense sector the

57
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,320
policy sector the private sector

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,240
we are all thinking about how do we do

59
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
this now

60
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,759
clearly european foreign policy is in a

61
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,119
bit of a mess at the moment because

62
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:07,680
we've seen

63
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,440
a lot of differences recently on how to

64
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,599
manage challenges from belarus to russia

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,520
to turkey the eastern mediterranean

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
even if one can steal your physical

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
freedom he can't steal freedom of

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,720
thoughts

69
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,760
and freedom of conscience

70
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
this year belarusians understood what

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
freedom means after this year

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,080
belarusians

73
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,840
will never forget the value of freedom

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,959
european union is not trying to compete

75
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
or to substitute for the defense our

76
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
connoisseur of defense is still nato

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
but we are missing some capabilities and

78
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,040
we are looking for those which are

79
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,879
actually not on the both sides of the

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,400
atlantic or which are missing

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
desperately in europe and we cannot just

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,879
simply buy it

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,640
my favorite panel has been the one on

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
hybrid threat to me this is the fight of

85
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,360
the future

86
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,760
is looking at ways in which adverse

87
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,519
actors are trying to undermine our

88
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,480
democracies

89
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,440
or change our values or do things which

90
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,200
go against our interests
