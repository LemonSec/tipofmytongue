17
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,720
the german council on foreign relations

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,320
and we are going to be talking about

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,560
transatlantic tech today and i think

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,320
there are very few issues that could be

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,119
more timely especially given the fact

22
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:27,520
that

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,680
we are just at this exact moment in

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,720
brussels

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,439
a usu summit is taking place president

26
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,159
biden

27
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,079
is meeting with the leaders of the eu to

28
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,320
discuss exactly these issues

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,079
so what we want to do today is give you

30
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,079
guys a little preview of what we think

31
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,000
they should be discussing and what might

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,360
be on the agenda

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,159
um i think we're all aware that when the

34
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,920
u.s delegation came to europe they

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
highlighted what they called the three

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,240
c's

37
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,119
as their priorities covid china and

38
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,640
climate

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
but i want to add three more c's to that

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,640
uh to to round it out

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,119
i want to add uh connectivity commerce

42
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,159
and cyber

43
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
and i think that all three of these c's

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,399
which deal with the the digital agenda

45
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,120
are enabling of the rest of the

46
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,200
transatlantic agenda generally

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
and what we want to see in a democratic

48
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,640
world order

49
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,879
um we had this meeting at the g7 there

50
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,239
was some discussion around

51
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,440
uh digital technology and specifically

52
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,319
countering

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,120
ict and the belton road initiative at

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,720
nato yesterday they announced

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,800
new work on emerging disruptive

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,920
technologies

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,519
uh and today they're going to be

58
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,120
launching what we assume

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,680
will be a trade and tech council to

60
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
really delve into these issues

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,280

62
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,720

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,000

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,959
for democratic tech and to answer that

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,599

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
with fran so we've got this this big

124
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,639
idea this transatlantic trade and tech

125
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,360
council

126
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,000
a lot of uh wish lists out there for

127
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,360
what should be on the agenda

128
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,880
what do you think should be the

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
priorities how do you scope this type of

130
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
council well i think it's a good

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,919
initiative first i mean i think it's an

132
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,600
important initiative because it's time

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,320
for the us

134
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
and for the eu to talk together on these

135
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,600
particular

136
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,520
issues however there is a long history

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,840
of dialogues councils between the united

138
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,199
states and the eu

139
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,280
fading into obscurity and we don't want

140
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,199
that to happen

141
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,039
i think the number one important point

142
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,960
is simply to put these items

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,680
in a more prominent place in the agenda

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,080
this

145
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,560
is a major transatlantic

146
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,919
market and just to give you one data

147
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,639
point

148
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,199
uh the united states companies

149
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,479
they supply about

150
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,759
200 billion dollars worth of information

151
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,400
services

152
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,199
in europe compared to 3.5 billion in

153
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,080
china

154
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,240
21 billion in latin america so just so

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,080
you see what a what a market

156
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,479
the transatlantic market is so it's

157
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,800
important to address that in a sustained

158
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,039
continuing manner and to get policy

159
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,319
makers to actually

160
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,120
talk about these things we do suspect

161
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,080
that the the

162
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,479
first priority of this will be the easy

163
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,360
priority the

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,759
the thing on which we already agree

165
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,400
which is

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
more resilient infrastructures uh

167
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,759
security

168
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,319
cyber security standards and all of

169
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,080
these types of things that

170
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,120
we both the united states and europe see

171
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
as important for our digital economies

172
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,000
so a very positive agenda on that

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,240
however it's the trade and tech council

174
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,560
and there's clearly at least in the

175
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,120
documents that have been leaked so far

176
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,960
they're clearly and in the reports that

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,120
have emerged there clearly is an element

178
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
of keeping trade in this

179
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
in this uh council and it's not clear to

180
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,720
me

181
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,440
that these two agendas if we want to

182
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,080
talk about

183
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
trade barriers and things like that it's

184
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
not clear to me that they

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,720
mesh well together but we'll have to see

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
it's also not clear that the

187
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,639
trade and tech council has a mandate

188
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,000
right now to talk about some of the more

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,360
challenging issues such as competition

190
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,639
policy

191
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,080
privacy and some of the other many

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,319
challenging issues that we find for

193
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,000
example in trying to

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,720
restore data trend or in trying to

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,840
reassure

196
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,919
companies about data transfers between

197
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,280
the united states and

198
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,520
the eu so there are a lot of issues

199
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,560
we're not quite clear

200
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
if they're going to be covered in this

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,240
we'll have to see we're not quite clear

202
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,560
who's going to lead it and whether they

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,280
will have

204
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,960
the required ability to reach throughout

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
the u.s government and throughout the

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,199
commission and the eu

207
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,039
to bring forces together to have a

208
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,560
really constructive discussion

209
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
but it's an important step forward we

210
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
should all give everyone a big round of

211
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
applause for doing this

212
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
and now uh we'll have to see how it

213
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,479
develops

214
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,800
thanks so much for that that opener anna

215
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
michelle you're watching this from the

216
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,120
european parliament

217
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,199
you are in the uh both in the trade

218
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,400
committee uh

219
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,080
very senior role in the trade committee

220
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,919
and in the ai committee

221
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,440
uh one of the big issues that keeps

222
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,039
coming up in these conversations is

223
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,720
technical standards and a lot of the

224
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
leaks that have come out already

225
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
talk about standard setting convergence

226
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,199
the role of the us and eu working

227
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,280
together to really set these standards

228
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,560
where do you see potential here and

229
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
where do you see pitfalls

230
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,039
well tyson first of all thanks for

231
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,960
having me it's great to be discussing

232
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
this really important topic with such

233
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,120
distinguished company

234
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,399
um you you mentioned the three c's uh i

235
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,640
think we're now waiting for the three ds

236
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,760
we're waiting for the leaders to deliver

237
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,159
and we're waiting for a deal and we're

238
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,399
waiting for them to do what is necessary

239
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,480
frankly to make sure that they safeguard

240
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,440
what i call democracy 2.0

241
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,760
um so having said that i agree that you

242
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,000
know we're waiting for this uh trade and

243
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
tech council

244
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
it's definitely a move in the right

245
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
direction it'll definitely be dealing

246
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,680
with these issues

247
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
this is what i expect to be on the table

248
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,120
ai cyber

249
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,839
um standards across the board even for

250
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,200
pharmaceuticals for example

251
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,120
um clearly we also need to deal with

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,279
quantum computing so these these are the

253
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,800
issues i would see there and

254
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,080
of course we expect some solutions for

255
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
example for

256
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,640
one of the one for srem ii i mean i

257
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,240
understand that this is a difficult

258
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,120
issue

259
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,399
i understand um the legal aspects of it

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,320
but quite frankly i think that we need

261
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,240
to find a short-term solution that will

262
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,320
provide at least some sort of certainty

263
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,360
legally

264
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
to industry after all we're talking

265
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,640
about a trillion euros a year worth of

266
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
uh commerce of which data is sort of a

267
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,360
lifeblood so

268
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,440
we need some certainty even if we

269
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,399
proceed in a

270
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
more multilateral context for a longer

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,839
term solution

272
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,320
now on the trade aspects delighted to

273
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,040
see that

274
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,959
vp dumb brusque has just tweeted that

275
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,320
there's a deal on

276
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,920
on airbus and boeing from what i

277
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,360
understand this is sort of a five-year

278
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,079
moratorium

279
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,600
until we can figure out how to deal with

280
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
this and how to deal with subsidies

281
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,040
across the board maybe with china

282
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,399
as well so that's definitely

283
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,880
good news it certainly shows that there

284
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,920
is

285
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,720
a will and frankly when where there is a

286
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
will

287
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,640
there is a way and that goes for

288
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
steel as well because this is a big

289
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,399
issue for the eu

290
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,760
i mean you can't really say we're

291
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
partners and in nato and that we're a

292
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,399
threat to national security so um

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,160
232 safeguards and standards uh

294
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,480
steel tariffs need to need to be

295
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,320
addressed at some point with respect to

296
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,360
trade

297
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,560
now i agree that we don't want this

298
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
council to turn into just you know

299
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,640
another discussion forum it sounds to me

300
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,040
like

301
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,880
because of the high level leadership um

302
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,680
it's going to be something that has lots

303
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,519
of potential to progress

304
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,880
and in order to do so we need i think

305
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,480
a strict timetable set deliverables

306
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
and we need to put our priorities to get

307
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,839
our priorities straight

308
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,640
and our priorities definitely have to be

309
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,200
around

310
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,399
common standards the european union is

311
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,440
now has an

312
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
ai act on the table i don't see why that

313
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,680
can't be an excellent starting point for

314
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
a discussion

315
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
and in the trade sector i think we need

316
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
to talk about supply chains

317
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
these are issues that affect both of us

318
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,640
uh resilience

319
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,720
and diversification of supply chains we

320
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,320
need to talk about semiconductors we

321
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
need to talk about critical raw

322
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
materials

323
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,959
if we're going to deal with uh climate

324
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,560
change effectively in our digital

325
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,760
transformation so

326
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,120
i think i'll stop at that it's an

327
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
ambitious agenda

328
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,079
but it's an essential agenda and

329
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
i'll just say that what we need to be

330
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,519
doing more than

331
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,040
ever now is burying the hatchet and

332
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,839
and focusing on what brings us together

333
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,959
and not on what

334
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,320
could set us apart thanks so much anna

335
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,200
michelle

336
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,440
anna uh anna michelle mentioned where

337
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
there's a will there's a way

338
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,760
and fran mentioned some of the the tough

339
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,279
issues the sticky issues one of which

340
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,000
was privacy

341
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,560
shield anna michelle mentioned shrems ii

342
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,680
the decision

343
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,440
clearly we have a lot of uncertainty

344
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,279
right now in the transatlantic personal

345
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,040
data flow space

346
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,880
what do you see as the likelihood that

347
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
we can get to a solution

348
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,760
on a new privacy shield to create

349
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,839
certainty for transatlantic data flows

350
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,720
and what do you think

351
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,079
needs to happen to get there

352
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,760
well first of all thank you very much

353
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,120
for having me at this important meeting

354
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
just to clarify edri stands for european

355
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,320
digital rights which is

356
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,600
europe's sole community for digital

357
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,839
rights advocates we have about 45 member

358
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,120
organizations

359
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,920
your important questions i largely agree

360
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,240
with

361
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,560
fran's analysis and data flows and the

362
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,040
privacy shield is the elephant in the

363
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,480
room that needs to be addressed

364
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,079
however as sure if there is a new

365
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,720
privacy shield assurance night comes

366
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
after day there will also be a shrems

367
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,720
number three so

368
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,279
as a digital rights community we think

369
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,240
that really

370
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,440
the only long-term solution is for the

371
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,079
u.s

372
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,800
to modify its events laws and practices

373
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,000
because that's what the cgiu judgement

374
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,160
was based on

375
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,959
this is not just our opinion about three

376
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,320
days ago or so

377
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,360
vice president vera eurover said exactly

378
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,639
the same

379
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,240
thing in a in a public meeting

380
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,040
she said pass new laws if you want data

381
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,079
transfer

382
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,360
deal um so that's very important

383
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,440
but also uh last but not least

384
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,040
you've got the whole u.s digital rights

385
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,839
community

386
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
consumer groups and digital right groups

387
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,240
are all agreeing that

388
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,880
having an effective federal level

389
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,959
privacy legislation

390
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,120
it's not just good for you consumers

391
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
it's what the u.s

392
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,760
people want as well and have wanted for

393
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,639
many years in fact a coalition of them

394
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,320
have recently written to president biden

395
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,199
require requiring such laws to be

396
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,360
implemented

397
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,720
in 2019 there were no less than

398
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,760
11 data protection privacy law proposal

399
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,720
proposals in the u.s congress none of

400
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,519
them have been

401
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,959
implemented so far we assume because

402
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,600
there is no will in the senate to

403
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,199
support it

404
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,120
uh so you know that is the long term

405
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,480
uh viable solution

406
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
i'll stop now i have a lot to add on the

407
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,040
rest of the agenda which is by the way

408
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
very welcome and timely

409
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,040
thank you thanks so much anna marta

410
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,600
as as anna mentioned this is a pretty

411
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,199
broad agenda and you know

412
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,720
when you talk about tech policy these

413
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
days you're just really talking about

414
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,040
policy because

415
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,639
tech touches on everything digital

416
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,079
touches on everything

417
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,760
and one of the things that it touches on

418
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,199
is is the strategic

419
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,760
orientation that europe wants to create

420
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
and they have created a term

421
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,519
uh that is used often in brussels in

422
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,199
paris and berlin

423
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,720
which is digital sovereignty and i want

424
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,839
to ask you

425
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,839
what does what do you see under this

426
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,920
term how does central europe work with

427
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,959
this term

428
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,639
and how what does this mean for the

429
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,800
transatlantic digital relationship this

430
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,240
idea of digital sovereignty

431
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,639
thank you so much tyson uh hello

432
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,800
everyone uh it's great to be here and

433
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,079
first of all i would just like to

434
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,759
recognize how

435
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,880
um how great this is that we're in an

436
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,440
almost all female panel on transatlantic

437
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
issues doesn't happen very often so well

438
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:05,920
done

439
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
uh to the to the organizers especially

440
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,199
on this um

441
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,079
very special day of the eu us uh summit

442
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,360
that is happening

443
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,440
in the background or actually has just

444
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,199
um concluded

445
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,440
um thank you for your great question on

446
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,560
on on

447
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,199
um on strategic directions europe wants

448
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,240
to take

449
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,279
um over say past 18 months we've

450
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,600
we've heard different concepts different

451
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
interpretations

452
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,639
be it strategic autonomy sovereignty

453
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,079
digital

454
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,320
sovereignty and i would say that uh

455
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,120
looking at the

456
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,000
sequence of what happened in the past uh

457
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
few days with the president biden's

458
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,759
uh visit to g7 uh nato conversations

459
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,320
yesterday

460
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,560
i think there are foundations to start

461
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,079
looking into strategic interdependence

462
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,240
my view is that no matter how you

463
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
interpret digital sovereignty still

464
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,560
a more negative take could be uh taking

465
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,040
um out of that uh discussion and i

466
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
honestly feel that after

467
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,319
a few or three years of the

468
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,480
transatlantic uh relationship

469
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,799
and looking at the commitments already

470
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,880
made throughout the past

471
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,079
five days uh interdependence is what we

472
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,119
should be looking at

473
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,240
recognizing everything that both sides

474
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,359
bring to the table

475
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,959
or more sites when you look at broader

476
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,720
forms like

477
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,599
g7 but i think if there is one

478
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,319
commitment

479
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,280
that stands out from all the summits

480
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
that have taken

481
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,360
uh place uh is a joint recognition of

482
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,320
global threats

483
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,520
and needs to work um together

484
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,160
and that should be uh and and that

485
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,120
should be the

486
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,360
the takeaway together with everything

487
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,000
that uh my other co-panelists uh brought

488
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
up they're very concrete

489
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
uh things of the on the table be it

490
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:52,799
trade

491
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,240
uh issues one an erased uh or private

492
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,640
shield

493
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,160
than than that other um a race what i

494
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,679
would add to the mix

495
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,400
um is that i truly believe that if we

496
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:04,880
want

497
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,280
ttc to be a meaningful tool we should

498
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,559
already look

499
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,200
uh into what is being discussed on both

500
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,360
sides of the atlantic like for example

501
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,000
dsa

502
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,039
and dma in europe that would have a

503
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,200
significant transatlantic

504
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,039
effect would have a global effect on how

505
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,640
technology uh

506
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,760
works and that's where we would see uh

507
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,600
meaningful outcomes um of the of the ttc

508
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,679
and i think when it comes to centro and

509
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,760
eastern europe in specific and a take on

510
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,480
strategic

511
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,760
um strategic um

512
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,880
beat autonomy or digital uh sovereignty

513
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,720
i i would say that

514
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
there is probably kind of a distinction

515
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,919
when it comes to

516
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,960
take the takes of of governments uh in

517
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,440
this region and i think that comes from

518
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,200
um from uh that that is for two

519
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,240
reasons one is historical and

520
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,360
and the role of the us uh in in

521
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,160
shaping post-communist uh countries and

522
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,559
and

523
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,280
and probably a greater openness uh to

524
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,720
seek diversity of

525
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,760
for in this case um tech supply

526
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,200
and uh and the second reason um to it

527
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,960
is this hunger for catching up and

528
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,480
leapfrogging and seeking

529
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,760
all possible um opportunities uh

530
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,720
globally

531
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,440
um to really get the best access uh to

532
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,320
solutions be

533
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,440
beat within tech or other um industries

534
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,640
and i could only wish that

535
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,559
uh this part of europe would be will be

536
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,480
playing an even more significant role in

537
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,520
the debate of

538
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,600
on on future strategic directions

539
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,679
thanks so much marta uh we're going to

540
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,200
do another round and i want to mention

541
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:45,600
now

542
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
that we're going to open it up for

543
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,880
questions there are three ways that you

544
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,679
guys can ask

545
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,080
questions we have an audience here we're

546
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,720
back in

547
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,799
we're slowly edging into post-covet

548
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,880
times and we do have an audience

549
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,400
if you are in the audience there are

550
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,480
microphones on the side so just raise

551
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
your hand and go to one of the mics

552
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,400
otherwise you can ask a question on

553
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,640
slido over the globesec

554
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,080
app or you can ask a question over zoom

555
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,760
so we've got three opportunities three

556
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
ways to ask questions and please start

557
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,480
to

558
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,919
start to think of what you want to ask

559
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,000
our great panelists friend i want to

560
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,679
pick up on this issue of

561
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,120
digital sovereignty because it's

562
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,200
something that you hear a lot

563
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
in brussels in berlin and paris i don't

564
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,799
know if you hear as much of it

565
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,799
in central europe but you're sitting in

566
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,960
washington how does washington

567
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,919
interpret this kind of strategic

568
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,159
doctrine or orientation and what do they

569
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,600
see behind it

570
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,240
well i think it is uh kind of a mystery

571
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,400
to many in washington as to why this has

572
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
become so important

573
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,039
i think to some degree washington needs

574
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,200
some consciousness raising

575
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,159
i think that if we found for example

576
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,200
that

577
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
we were all buying stuff on a french

578
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
marketplace and we were getting our

579
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,159
information

580
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,200
from a german company

581
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,440
that we would want to think again

582
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
about the balance of where companies are

583
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,120
and why we hadn't done

584
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,520
so well in creating companies but

585
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,360
there's a difference between

586
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
creating companies and supporting

587
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,120
research and things like that

588
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,400
and and i think that in the united

589
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,440
states when people

590
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,520
hear about europe's uh horizon 2020 and

591
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,520
other plans uh the the in the

592
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,960
recovery fund 20 going to digital

593
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,960
that's all great the question is

594
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,120
does the type of thing does digital

595
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,840
sovereignty start leading into

596
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
protectionism

597
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,559
and we've had a couple of instances

598
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,520
where it has at first appeared that way

599
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,559
and then it has moderated but sometimes

600
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,720
not all the way for example there are

601
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,559
lots of american companies that are

602
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,360
engaged

603
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,240
in gaia x the cloud service providing

604
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,559
but

605
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,760
not on the governing council and so

606
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,679
that is a question mark um

607
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,240
the dma the digital markets act was was

608
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,600
mentioned and i think that this is

609
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,080
probably

610
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,559
the biggest question one that as far as

611
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,480
we can tell is not really on the tech

612
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,440
and trade

613
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,640
the trade and tech council agenda but as

614
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
as this proposal is written right now

615
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,159
it looks like it will be a series of

616
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,760
laws that apply only to

617
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,240
american companies that have that only

618
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,600
american companies will have reached the

619
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,240
threshold where this law will apply

620
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,760
so i think that digital sovereignty

621
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,159
is something that in the united states

622
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,520
raises question about

623
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,440
sovereign from whom aren't we supposed

624
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,360
to be in this together

625
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,280
and i think that the notion

626
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,400
and the ability to

627
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,280
overcome the misunderstandings that such

628
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,640
a term can create

629
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
is one of the principal benefits that i

630
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,240
hope we will see from

631
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,240
the tech from the turret and tech

632
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
council

633
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,000
anna michelle you know just looking at

634
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,440
this through the context of digital

635
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,240
sovereignty

636
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,840
you know we have the digital services

637
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
act which really deals with

638
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,200
content moderation and we have the

639
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,280
digital markets act which is looking at

640
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
tipping and gatekeepers and and market

641
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,400
power of digital services

642
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,960
and there is an impression that both are

643
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,320
kind of tailored

644
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
to the experience that has occurred over

645
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,080
the past 15 years

646
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
of online platforms primarily coming out

647
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,919
of the united states

648
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,600
but if you look at the artificial

649
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
intelligence regulation

650
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,000
there is a lot of reflection there of

651
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,720
the experience we're seeing in china

652
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
i was wondering if you could talk a

653
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,000
little bit about the deliberations in

654
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,600
the european parliament when you look at

655
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,640
things like

656
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,320
social scoring and how that's being

657
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,000
implemented into the regulation or

658
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,279
things like

659
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,559
remote biometric identification etc

660
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,039
and to what extent is that inflected by

661
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,840
new experiences and rising powers like

662
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,159
china

663
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,799
i'd say it's uh this is a vivid and

664
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,000
vibrant discussion

665
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,320
in the parliament uh in the context of

666
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,480
all this legislation that's on the table

667
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,159
that you discussed but

668
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,559
um generally when we talk about these

669
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,159
emerging technologies

670
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,960
and i think that these are points of

671
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,480
major points of

672
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,039
potential convergence with the with the

673
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,799
united states because when you talk

674
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,679
about

675
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,720
you know what how thing how these

676
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,000
technologies can actually be

677
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,679
used then you have to talk about the

678
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,919
principles that guide them and the rules

679
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,039
that will

680
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
um guide that will regulate this entire

681
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
situation and

682
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
i understand that uh this discussion

683
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,960
that we just had about tech sovereignty

684
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,919
and um open strategic autonomy i

685
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,080
understand that this you know

686
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
makes these you know little bells ring

687
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,760
in the back of our heads because

688
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,000
we're not just talking about protection

689
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
which we have joint interest in

690
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,679
sometimes but protectionism and

691
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,760
that's not at all how i see it in fact

692
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,679
um i just

693
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,919
coming coming full circle around this

694
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,200
issue

695
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,480
when we talk about autonomy in in

696
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,039
europe strategic autonomy one of the

697
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,720
reasons that we're doing it is that we

698
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,240
we want to become stronger

699
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,080
geopolitically and quite frankly the

700
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
stronger the stronger we become the

701
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,919
stronger partners we can be

702
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,640
for the united states and for the world

703
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,159
a chain is only as strong

704
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,799
as as each of its of its links and

705
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,799
actually i like to remind people because

706
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,600
i'm

707
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,400
i'm greek um that autonomy is a greek

708
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,799
word

709
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,600
it comes from aftos which means self and

710
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,360
nomus which means law

711
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,320
and literally what it means is you're

712
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,840
safeguarding your right

713
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,320
to make the rules and this is what this

714
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,960
is about

715
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,279
this is about who who has the power

716
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,919
depends largely on who makes the rules

717
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,039
in the digital age who decides whether

718
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,159
social scoring is acceptable um

719
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,559
i think that we'll find lots of lots of

720
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,559
convergence points over making these

721
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,600
types of rules

722
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
and this is actually something that the

723
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,200
european union knows how to do pretty

724
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,480
well if you see

725
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,039
you know what we did in gdpr these these

726
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
rules became

727
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,960
um global standards so called the

728
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,480
so-called brussels effect

729
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,400
so uh why not work together

730
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,679
uh with democracy and

731
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,799
protection of civil rights and

732
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,360
the rule of law in a multilateral

733
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
context and who is better to

734
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,559
inspire the world than a

735
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,120
a great union of the united states and

736
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,600
europe

737
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
around these issues which are going to

738
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,279
determine

739
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,640
the future of democracy

740
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,200
anna you know we're starting to see a

741
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,840
change

742
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,679
we're hearing a lot of language on both

743
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:53,120
sides of the atlantic about who's

744
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,240
setting the rules

745
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,919
and a lot of that is geared towards

746
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,640
china that just by virtue of

747
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,880
the export of technologies the export of

748
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,960
artificial intelligence software ict

749
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,840
infrastructure

750
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,000
et cetera that there is an implicit

751
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,360
embedded rule setting

752
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,320
capability uh within that within the

753
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,159
those operations and that china is

754
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:14,880
becoming

755
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,000
increasingly um revisionist

756
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
in the way that it sees global rules on

757
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,200
things like

758
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,320
privacy data protection data processing

759
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,240
surveillance et cetera of course we see

760
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,360
that domestically in china

761
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,799
how much is this involved in the

762
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,559
discourse around digital rights in

763
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:33,120
europe

764
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,039
looking at china and the kind of

765
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,960
alternative model that it's looking to

766
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,159
set

767
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,679
the trade and tech council from what

768
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,600
i've read is going to have a democracy

769
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,399
pillar

770
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,760
what do you think should be in that

771
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,600
democracy pillar and how should it

772
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,559
relate to

773
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
authoritarian states like china but also

774
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,799
russia

775
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,720
that's a very good question thank you

776
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,520
the discussion amongst the digital uh

777
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,159
rights community

778
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,200
so far has been um and and you know

779
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
front touched a little bit on this

780
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,120
has been based on this issue of

781
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,080
monopolistic control

782
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,279
by a small number of big tech companies

783
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,159
mainly us

784
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,240
companies this is increasingly the case

785
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,480
with companies in china you know take

786
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,640
tiktok for example so

787
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,799
that's becoming part of the discussion

788
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,480
in terms of the democratic deficit

789
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,840
obviously the practices in china and

790
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,159
what's happening with the sort of

791
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,200
states events there in russia are

792
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
very important for the digital rights

793
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,559
community but

794
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,760
is just beginning to focus on these

795
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,960
issues

796
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,559
uh most of the focus at the moment

797
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,840
uh is about the monopolistic

798
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,440
power of the big platforms um and

799
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
actually it's not just the discussion in

800
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,559
the eu

801
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,279
it's in europe it's also the discussion

802
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,120
in the us you've had

803
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,799
um the reports from uh the judiciary

804
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,600
committee david cicilline the

805
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
mentioned that this power has to be

806
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,159
controlled

807
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,159
you have the dma and the dsa in europe

808
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,679
so i would say the reasons for all this

809
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,760
sovereignty discussion

810
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,799
is because you know as also an anna

811
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,640
mitchell also mentioned

812
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,840
there is a need for the partners to be

813
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,559
equal

814
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,039
for the two democracies to be together

815
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,399
and work equal

816
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,679
and this is not going to happen so far

817
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,960
as you have

818
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,640
monopolistic platforms that control the

819
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,760
content

820
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,799
of what's going on online and therefore

821
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,159
enable this data exploitation and big

822
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,600
deficits to

823
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,880
democracy which frankly china and

824
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,240
russia can also ex

825
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,679
take advantage of as we've seen in

826
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,799
recent elections

827
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,799
marta this is obviously a point that

828
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,880
google is very familiar with uh google

829
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,159
is a the major player in search it is

830
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,159
the major one of the major players in ad

831
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,200
tech

832
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,679
has a number of lines of service across

833
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,399
which it

834
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,880
uses data analytics it's developed a

835
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,120
very successful business model

836
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,399
what is google's position on the frankly

837
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,559
transatlantic discourse around market

838
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,720
power of online platforms

839
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,799
of which i think four or five are really

840
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,918
kind of in the crosshairs

841
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,360
i think uh thank you uh tyson and uh

842
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,840
also thank you anna for uh for pointing

843
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,640
out the

844
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,880
the issue so i think we've been very

845
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,960
clear from the very beginning that that

846
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,080
we welcome

847
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,799
everything that uh european commission

848
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,640
uh laid out very early

849
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,200
uh in the in the term because there is a

850
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,640
third consensus that

851
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,279
those questions need to be resolved and

852
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,200
need to be

853
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,039
looked at from a from a from a close-up

854
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,080
and i think that points um that points

855
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,120
out the difference

856
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,840
uh that there is between the u.s tech

857
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
ecosystem versus

858
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,799
the one associated with bad actors that

859
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,720
we enter those discussions we we open up

860
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,159
ourselves to compliance and

861
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,240
we contribute and i think we are part of

862
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,480
the of the forums where we

863
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,519
both contribute um and listen uh to the

864
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,320
feedback and

865
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,080
this is where um we hope ttc

866
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,279
uh will come in uh to embrace different

867
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,240
perspectives to embrace concerns and

868
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,120
challenges

869
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,240
um that are shared between the u.s

870
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,039
um and europe bearing in mind our third

871
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:53,600
uh

872
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,640
values but also uh then the necessities

873
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,679
coming from

874
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,640
what are the global challenges that i

875
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,760
spoke

876
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,960
about in my um previous uh

877
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,320
intervention i think um in the past

878
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,399
uh weeks at various occasions we've

879
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:12,559
heard for example different ideas about

880
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,080
the scopes

881
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,399
of the of the regulations uh we

882
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,519
discussed already

883
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,200
uh in this panel such as dsa uh ndma

884
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,480
so uh moving out um stretching that

885
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,600
discussion over

886
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,159
the atlantic is a guarantee

887
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,960
that a scope would not be describing

888
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
discriminatory in nature would not only

889
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,760
target

890
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,440
specific companies but we would be

891
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,440
focusing um

892
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,799
on issues that will will not

893
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,840
outlive companies uh like google but

894
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,279
will define

895
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,480
uh rules for the future as well

896
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,919
we're starting to get some good

897
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,080
questions over uh slido and we have one

898
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,600
question on zoom so i'm going to take

899
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
one question from slido

900
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,720
and then i'm going to take one question

901
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,559
from zoom from jack

902
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,360
dalrymple from australia so our first

903
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,880
question is from ziga turk

904
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,200
who asked how can one hope to lead in

905
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,320
standard setting

906
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,640
if if not leading in innovation and i

907
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,320
think that is a great question for ana

908
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,639
michel

909
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,519
i agree they're absolutely intertwined

910
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,080
tyson standard setting and innovation

911
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,399
these are these are intertwined um

912
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,880
but i think that you'll find that europe

913
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
is ambitious with respect to innovation

914
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
i think it's unfair to

915
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,360
you know to say that europe isn't i mean

916
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,880
europe has really

917
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,960
uh made major investments i'm not going

918
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,399
to go through all the

919
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,960
the funding that is available but okay

920
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,799
when you compare it maybe to the budget

921
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,279
that for example the united states has

922
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,720
for ai announced uh or if you compare it

923
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,919
even to

924
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,440
a lot of the funding that we've seen i

925
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,919
mean china in six months invested

926
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,679
something like half a billion dollars in

927
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,320
just eight

928
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,120
ai projects but at the same time you

929
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,320
can't say the eu

930
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,240
hasn't put this as a priority hasn't

931
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,440
focused on this

932
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,080
and hasn't had results so i i don't buy

933
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,600
into the rhetoric that you know we've

934
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,159
lost the ai raise this is all finished i

935
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,520
don't buy into that at all we have

936
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,199
excellent talent in europe

937
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,000
we have a strategy we're investing money

938
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,399
and

939
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,918
i'm not saying we don't need to

940
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,599
collaborate and i'm not saying that you

941
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,960
know china

942
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,560
isn't isn't uh you know going full speed

943
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,359
and the us

944
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,079
as well but europe is certainly a player

945
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:28,480
and

946
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,079
um i think that setting the rules

947
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,280
of the game is a big part of

948
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,719
being able to master the game

949
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,639
if not win the game and i'm not sure

950
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,719
that that's the overall objective anyway

951
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,639
i mean it's not it's not you know it's

952
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,000
not just a race for

953
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,520
power it is but it's not just that it's

954
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,079
also

955
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,560
about uh setting the rules and

956
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,560
innovation is also about

957
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,119
people it's also about democracy it's

958
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,079
also about

959
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,280
values and um i think

960
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,880
we need an approach that is

961
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,320
ideological political and also pragmatic

962
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,880
i mean this we are a global community

963
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,400
and we're going to have to be working

964
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,359
together and they're going to be

965
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,200
diverging interests and we need to find

966
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,079
a way to do that

967
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:17,839
and the way to do that is to be sitting

968
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,200
down at a table

969
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,400
and agreeing on rules

970
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,359
all right we have a question from zoom

971
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,720
uh

972
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
let's tee that up right now jack you're

973
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,160
on online

974
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,640
perfect um thank you so much for the

975
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,240
discussions had so far and lovely to be

976
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,119
joining you from

977
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,480
melbourne australia on the other side of

978
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,200
the world um so far the discussions had

979
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,440
around eu us practice projections and

980
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,200
data surveillance policies

981
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,359
um have we obviously understand that

982
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,200
those have broad implications on how

983
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,800
other countries and around the world

984
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,560
utilize and share their data

985
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,160
um it's already been discussed to some

986
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,560
extent the kind of strategic competition

987
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,040
that is occurring between eu and u.s and

988
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,400
china obviously

989
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,320
um i want to understand from the panel

990
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,240
especially anna michelle and fran

991
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,440
um what you think would be the

992
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,400
implications of if the us and eu

993
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,160
failed to actually come to an agreement

994
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,640
on standard kind of gold standard

995
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,359
protections for um for individual people

996
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,480
and using data

997
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,839
um what does that look like and what

998
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,359
implications would that have on the

999
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,119
global economy and i suppose it started

1000
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,200
future that would have

1001
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
maybe fran first and then anna michelle

1002
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,040
sure i think that

1003
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,920
over say 10 years just to give a time

1004
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,960
frame

1005
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,520
if there were not an understanding of

1006
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,160
the

1007
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,720
of how to do data transfers between the

1008
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,119
u.s and the eu

1009
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,800
the first thing that would happen i

1010
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,720
think we're already seeing

1011
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,800
uh in the wake of the two shrems

1012
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
decisions we're seeing more data

1013
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,520
localization here

1014
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,599
by by companies including american

1015
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,200
companies uh who

1016
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,280
service data uh here personally

1017
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,680
identifiable data

1018
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,240
i think however that even if you don't

1019
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,000
have standards then

1020
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,480
if we fail to come to standard to a

1021
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,680
better understanding of

1022
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,560
standards then even industrial data and

1023
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,320
how you use that i think you'll start to

1024
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,359
see

1025
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,440
kind of a breakdown in the ability to

1026
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,960
transfer that

1027
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,920
or you will see in certain areas of the

1028
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,400
world

1029
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,560
because i hope in 10 years the u.s will

1030
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,160
have privacy legislation

1031
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,079
that would prevent some abuses of data

1032
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,560
but in areas that don't have effective

1033
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,480
privacy legislation i think you'll see

1034
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,440
more of a wild west type thing and i

1035
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,560
think that that will go

1036
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,440
also for industrial data there may be

1037
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,160
more

1038
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,599
um stealing of data and things of that

1039
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,640
sort

1040
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,079
and so i think that this is something

1041
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,960
that we have to work out the us

1042
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,640
and the eu and other like-minded

1043
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,240
countries

1044
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,160
and it may be that there's a role for

1045
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,839
the g7 in

1046
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,240
starting to do this they have done uh

1047
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,400
digital data flows with trust

1048
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,040
um but i think that it is an important

1049
00:37:59,040 --> 00:37:59,760
thing

1050
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,040
because if there aren't rules we're just

1051
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,720
discovering now the way

1052
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,920
that data can be abused and i think that

1053
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,520
there are lots of people with creative

1054
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,119
but not necessarily

1055
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,200
high-minded thoughts about how to use

1056
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,480
data

1057
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,079
and michelle what do you think i mean

1058
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,839
the european parliament has very strong

1059
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,720
opinions about

1060
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,839
data privacy and gdpr and um but

1061
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,520
fran mentions a really good point which

1062
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
is the the scale of

1063
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,400
data processing is just increasing i

1064
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,079
mean we're just seeing more

1065
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,440
you know with with artificial

1066
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,880
intelligence with facial voice

1067
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,839
recognition

1068
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,720
the ability to reach into our lives and

1069
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,880
anticipate our own behavior and perhaps

1070
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,720
even manipulate our own behavior is just

1071
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,440
increasing

1072
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,359
so how can the us and europe really get

1073
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,800
this right and what what are the

1074
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,400
framework to what is the framework to do

1075
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,640
that

1076
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,560
well you know what they say tyson they

1077
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,040
say nature hates a void so it'll it'll

1078
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,240
actually fill it so

1079
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,720
if we don't do it somebody else will and

1080
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,720
uh you know china's a pretty big player

1081
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,280
and

1082
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,960
it has a totally different conception of

1083
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,720
what privacy means there is no

1084
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,400
you know you don't have any privacy

1085
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,320
rights as a citizen it's perfectly okay

1086
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,760
to surveil you

1087
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,280
every place so if we want to avoid um

1088
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,880
this model anybody who doesn't sit down

1089
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,640
at the table then other people if you're

1090
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,119
not

1091
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,560
if you're not at the table then somebody

1092
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,240
else will sit down at the table and make

1093
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,560
rules and you know actually frankly that

1094
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,960
you know in the eu let's not forget that

1095
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,880
like national security is a national

1096
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,160
competence so

1097
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,079
there are some issues on when we talk

1098
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,760
about trends too and we talk about the

1099
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,599
new privacy shield and dealing with this

1100
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,040
matter we don't just have the courts

1101
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,280
the ecj to consider we also have to

1102
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,240
consider

1103
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,160
that a solution could be let's say um

1104
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,200
sidebarred by national by nation states

1105
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,800
members of the european union and the

1106
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,400
same thing in the united states i mean

1107
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,880
you have

1108
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,400
these states popping up with their own

1109
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,000
laws all over the place

1110
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
maybe it's a good idea to have a federal

1111
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,200
framework

1112
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
after all so that's something to to

1113
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,560
think about

1114
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,800
but yes uh in the parliament you know

1115
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,320
where we're

1116
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,880
relentless when it comes to safeguarding

1117
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,880
people's privacy rights and again

1118
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,800
i don't wanna you know i don't wanna

1119
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,079
make this i understand

1120
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,560
the need to have a balance between

1121
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,319
strict regulation that protects our

1122
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,760
rights and at the same time

1123
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,160
leaving enough room in a global context

1124
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,040
where there are

1125
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,640
other players that don't play by the

1126
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,319
same rules that don't have such a high

1127
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,160
standard for privacy rights

1128
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,240
in order for our industry to remain

1129
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,839
competitive so you have to have

1130
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,720
safeguards

1131
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,880
on the on the side of the industrial

1132
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,480
policy as well

1133
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,000
having said all that again

1134
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,760
if we don't do it somebody else will

1135
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,040
just do it for us

1136
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,240
and that uh that's just not a good idea

1137
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,000
i mean i don't want a wild west but i

1138
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,079
also don't want somebody else's

1139
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,920
autocratic model to be enforced either

1140
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
uh through the you know at a table

1141
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,319
somewhere in a multilateral

1142
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,640
context that we're not involved in or

1143
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,160
through the back door

1144
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,720
uh via companies and their technologies

1145
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,280
uh

1146
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,079
taking advantage of a legislative void

1147
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,000
have we have got five minutes left we've

1148
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,440
got one question here on

1149
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,160
uh slido which i'm going to direct to

1150
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
marta but if you i'm going to broaden it

1151
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,920
a little bit so the question is

1152
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,680
to what extent is digital autonomy

1153
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,960
affected by

1154
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,200
the eu's semiconductor dependence with

1155
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,440
the us being dominant in chip design and

1156
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,520
asia being dominant in high-end chip

1157
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,440
manufacturing

1158
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
and i'm just going to expand this to say

1159
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,640
to what extent is

1160
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,440
uh digital autonomy possible whenever

1161
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,760
the eu is dependent on

1162
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,520
key enabling technologies from outside

1163
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,599
the eu not just

1164
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,280
semiconductors but also for example

1165
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,280
cloud computing

1166
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,599
how can the eu make sure that that is

1167
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,280
not putting it in a position

1168
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
of weakness or putting it in a position

1169
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,720
of strength vis-a-vis

1170
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:54,640
its its partners and competitors

1171
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,160
thank you uh tyson and to uh to the

1172
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
person that posed this question

1173
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,119
i think that definitely shortage of uh

1174
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,160
circuits of specific uh beats

1175
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,319
tools um is one of the many many reasons

1176
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,200
why those

1177
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,880
uh concepts of autonomy um and

1178
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,160
uh independence uh or sovereignty

1179
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,200
uh emerge but i think uh it's a it's a

1180
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,160
it's a much

1181
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,000
broader pool um of reasoning

1182
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,720
and uh it would be too simplistic to say

1183
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,280
it's all about uh semiconductors that's

1184
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,960
not something it's a it's of course a

1185
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,880
huge industry problem but not something

1186
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,200
that

1187
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,240
should call for a a strategic um

1188
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,920
direction of europe and and i'm sure

1189
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,160
that's not uh the only reason and i

1190
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,720
think

1191
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,839
when it comes to uh more

1192
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,960
digital less tangible dependencies

1193
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,520
uh that uh you mentioned which i

1194
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,040
wouldn't necessarily call

1195
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,560
uh dependencies i think uh this is much

1196
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,839
uh this is this is this is again much

1197
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,720
much broader and definitely uh more

1198
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,920
flexible than

1199
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,960
shortage um of specific tools

1200
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,760
uh needed to perform uh business or

1201
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,880
production

1202
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,720
and um and and here we are um

1203
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,520
i think what we should be looking into

1204
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,319
is the

1205
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,119
is what is the status quo what are even

1206
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:21,680
if

1207
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,880
europe was to claim uh autonomy or

1208
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,000
sovereignty what are the

1209
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
chances then to catch up with the

1210
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,760
rest of the world and maybe looking at

1211
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,599
the reapproachment we are witnessing

1212
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:34,720
today

1213
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,200
and in the past few months maybe i'm

1214
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,480
going to bring in this concept maybe

1215
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,160
strategic interdependence

1216
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,440
is also a mean to help europe get uh

1217
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,599
stronger just like the mep

1218
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,359
uh was uh saying today um

1219
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,920
today on the on the panel there is a lot

1220
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,920
to strength and realistically looking

1221
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,880
about

1222
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,960
realistically looking at capabilities

1223
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,000
and resources

1224
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,240
available and figuring out what can

1225
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,119
allies

1226
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,920
provide to each other to catch up

1227
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,640
on the individual technological uh

1228
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,079
strength and this is

1229
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,280
frankly where i also see um the the role

1230
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:13,839
for the

1231
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,640
industry that i that i represent and i

1232
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,119
think

1233
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,280
uh google um has been an important

1234
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,319
uh source uh ford for success

1235
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,079
for many european companies and

1236
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,680
especially when we think ahead about

1237
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,960
cloud opportunities

1238
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,440
uh this could only uh become more of a

1239
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,160
fact

1240
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,000
um going forward and i just don't i i do

1241
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,400
not

1242
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,079
believe that the autonomy discussion is

1243
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,000
happening in isolation

1244
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,560
i don't believe we're all starting uh

1245
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,079
from the same point

1246
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,119
um i think there's certain legacy uh

1247
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,400
in the background and a lot of

1248
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,800
challenges ahead um

1249
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,599
and again i'm very excited that we're

1250
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,280
having this conversation on a day where

1251
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,960
hopefully we're gonna talk about the new

1252
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,839
chapter

1253
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,400
of the transatlantic tech cooperation

1254
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,640
that that will be of mutual benefit that

1255
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,119
will respect the rights and expectations

1256
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:08,560
of the both sides of the of the atlantic

1257
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,240
will let the industry grow will

1258
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,880
let this great economic uh relationship

1259
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,920
um

1260
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,960
flourish uh but in more concrete terms

1261
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,520
would

1262
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,640
also help europe

1263
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,760
grow not not to have a

1264
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,160
reason when we meet same time next year

1265
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,359
to again

1266
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,839
touch upon touch upon concepts of

1267
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,560
autonomy

1268
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,319
marta that's an excellent note to end on

1269
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,520
and the idea of strategic

1270
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,480
interdependence

1271
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,280
is i think a good uh starting point or a

1272
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,800
good theme for the trade and tech

1273
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,920
council and hopefully we'll be able to

1274
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,200
meet here in a year

1275
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,800
and talk about the agenda items that

1276
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,359
they have uh laid out and maybe even

1277
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,960
some objectives that they've actually

1278
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,680
achieved

1279
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,079

influence so that will also be

1296
