um my name is julia blues i'm a senior

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,200
health correspondent at vox

67
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,920
and it's my pleasure to be here today i

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,200
think we're talking about one of the

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,599
most

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
important issues of the pandemic

71
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
how to build trust in vaccines in an

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
environment where it's

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,480
kind of exceptionally difficult to know

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,800
who or what to trust

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,040
not only do we have this kind of

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
onslaught of information and

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
scientific knowledge coming at us at all

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,840
times but we also

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
have to deal with bad actors who are

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,280
spreading misinformation and

81
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,879
disinformation

82
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,560
and so the focus today is on how to

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,280
fight information in security and we

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,159
have

85
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
a distinguished panel to help us so i'll

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,120

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,120

where he co-leads cross-government

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,319
planning and delivery of communication

101
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,200
activity

102
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
to achieve the uk's national security

103
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,959
objectives

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,120
we also have melinda frost who's joining

105
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,720

um in the world health organization

107

she's the leader of the translate

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,159
science team

109
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,959
and working on the inf infodemic

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,480
management kovit 19 response at who

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,920
and so today um like the um

112
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,400
infodemic we have questions coming at us

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,519
from all angles

114
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
so people will be submitting questions

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
via zoom

116
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,759
via the globsec app and of course for

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
everyone in the room you can stand up

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,358
or raise your hand when you have a

119
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,280
question and go to the microphone there

120
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,960
when you're called on and so i think the

121
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,880
the best way to start the panel today is

122
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,240
to kind of give it

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
give a sense to the audience of the

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,479
problem the scale of the problem

125
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
um and i thought from your various

126
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
vantage points we could talk about

127
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,680
how the misinformation or disinformation

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
campaigns you're tracking are affecting

129
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,080
the vaccine rollout

130
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,800
and maybe we could start with miroslava

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,160
thank you very much julia

132
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,040
also for this kind introduction so when

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,000
we speak about the

134
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,080
info they're making and uh this

135
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,479
information affecting vaccine rollout i

136
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,039
think

137
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,320
the obvious uh answer would be that yes

138
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,800
obviously this information does affect a

139
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
rollout of the vaccination

140
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,800
but then we also can't make sweeping

141
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,039
generalizations i think it's much better

142
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
in some countries you know some

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,759
countries where obviously conspiracy

144
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,639
theories about

145
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,800
covet 19 are not so prominent such as

146
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,880
for example in austria

147
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,440
they're according to our globsec trends

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,520
2021 data we see

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,840
that actually the disinformation

150
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,840
campaigns do not have such an effect

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,639
because

152
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,960
um the vaccination rollout there is more

153
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,919
successful

154
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,639
than in other ce countries um such as

155
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,360
for example

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,320
romania or bulgaria where you have quite

157
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,120
um

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,919
large prominence of some covet 19

159
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
related conspiracy theories so we do see

160
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,280
this this link between between

161
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,000
conspiracy

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,320
theories uh about covid19 or

163
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,680
disinformation

164
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,440
and and vaccination rollout but also

165
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,639
i would like to um just stress or point

166
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,039
out

167
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,840
that when we speak about this and

168
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,479
conspiracy theories we often

169
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,880
imagine you know the trolls in in saint

170
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,919
petersburg

171
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,360
spreading this information which is

172
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,560
absolutely true this has been a part of

173
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
of roll out of some vaccines where

174
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
really target of

175
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
strong disinformation campaigns or

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
information operations seeking to

177
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
discredit some of these vaccines

178
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,720
particularly the astrazeneca vaccine

179
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,759
but in the information chaos that is the

180
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,720
epidemic we have also seen that public

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,319
figures have

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,880
sometimes um you know wittingly or

183
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,080
unwittingly

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
provided incorrect information to the

185
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,360
public

186
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
and we can mention you know the former

187
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
president donald trump and

188
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,039
and and his advice to general

189
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,520
populations on how to treat kovite 19

190
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
which was actually incorrect

191
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
um or even sometimes i think mainstream

192
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:58,800
media

193
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,240
um have some in some cases struggled a

194
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,880
bit

195
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,160
with reporting on on the vaccination for

196
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,720
example in slovakia we had a case where

197
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
basically on a prime time tv at 8 00 p.m

198
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,479
when you know

199
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,599
um the the whole let's say nation

200
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,639
watches tv in the evening we had this

201
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,479
one case of a woman dying

202
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,520
uh shortly after receiving jeb um

203
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
from astrazeneca vaccine and um

204
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,520
this report basically made a direct made

205
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,160
a direct

206
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,599
link between this jab and between um

207
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,639
the resulting death of of this lady

208
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
later on it was discovered that the

209
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,560
death was not related to the vaccine

210
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,800
and that also you know the reporter who

211
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
was who was basically

212
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,280
responsible for producing the story was

213
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
her relative so there was obviously some

214
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
kind of a bias involved as well

215
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
but you know the damage has been done

216
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,360
and then when you have these kind of

217
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
stories promulgated in the information

218
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,319
space

219
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,199
it's very difficult for um for anybody

220
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,800
to really navigate

221
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,520
what is true and what isn't true anymore

222
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:05,840
so

223
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
right you know i'd love to bring in

224
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,199
melinda

225
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,160
in geneva who has kind of this global

226
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,039
overview

227
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,960
because you're seeing yeah that it's not

228
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,319
just um

229
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,360
it's not even just yeah online or public

230
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
figures there's also this

231
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,080
world of offline and impenetrable

232
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,080
networks of disinformation being spread

233
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,599
yeah all right thank you thank you julia

234
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,320
and i completely agree with the the

235
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,360
um things that miroslava had mentioned

236
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,120
as well that it's a pretty complicated

237
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,000
issue particularly when

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,519
it comes to vaccines we've always known

239
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,000
that

240
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,080
communicating vaccines even during

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,839
non-emergencies and rolling out new

242
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,760
vaccines can introduce a lot of

243
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,600
concerns and questions and valid

244
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,760
questions on the part of a population

245
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,399
but now during covert 19 when you pull

246
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,200
in the mix

247
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,240
of changing science um

248
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
eminent threat to some individual's

249
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
concern

250
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
and things are just changing so there's

251
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,200
a lot of uncertainty

252
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
people have questions and concerns so

253
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,800
this is sort of a right

254
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
field for miss and disinformation and

255
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,920
i'm really excited to see that we have a

256
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,480
session

257
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
on uh focused on infodemex this is

258
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,000
something that the world health

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,800
organization

260
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,519
has really uh pushed the envelope on we

261
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,680
started an infodemics management

262
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,320
pillar as part of the covid19 response

263
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
at the very beginning within the first

264
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,320
month of the response in 2020

265
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,560
so this has been an area of focus for us

266
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
so we've been trying to track

267
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
misinformation and disinformation and

268
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,040
really learn more about how to respond

269
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,839
to that

270
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,320
in order to address people's concerns

271
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,120
what we see

272
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,760
a lot when it comes to disinformation is

273
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,480
or

274
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,240
during any emergency it's essentially

275
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,000
that people will sort of revert back

276
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,920
to the information sources that they

277
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,000
trust those may be individuals they may

278
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,440
be

279
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680
mass media traditional media they may be

280
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,800
social media

281
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,480
and then i think what we found too

282
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
during coven 19 and particularly as

283
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,120
countries begin to do lockdowns too

284
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480
people were turning a little bit more

285
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,760
towards social media

286
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,200
and as people were uncertain and

287
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
uh more stressed because of the

288
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
situation of kokod 19

289
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,040
they sought more information to relieve

290
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
that stress and yet what we

291
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
think and what studies are being

292
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,920
beginning to show is that actually

293
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,640
caused

294
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,079
more stress because there were more

295
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,519
confusions particularly when they were

296
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,040
trying to seek information

297
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,760
with online sources so which is doing

298
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,519
quite a bit of work around this to

299
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,920
to figure out more about how to track

300
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
misinformation disinformation

301
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,040
uh learn more about how we um combat

302
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,959
that and how we can respond to that

303
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,839
to decrease that that conversation

304
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,640
online

305
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,320
and how to pre-bunk how to get

306
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,079
information good information

307
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,440
out before disinformation in this

308
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,160
information has a chance to really grow

309
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,720
within the information ecosphere so a

310
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
lot a lot of work going on around this

311
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,040
and

312
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,320
and i'm glad we're talking about

313
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
vaccines today this is a

314
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,920
you know the most important issue right

315
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,839
now but just to say too we've been

316
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,079
tracking miss and disinformation just in

317
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,720
the copa 19 response too in terms of

318
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,600
uh cures or prevention methods uh so

319
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
this has been something we've been doing

320
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
again for about 18 months and

321
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,240
we're learning quite a bit and i can

322
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
talk maybe a little bit later in the

323
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,279
program about what the future holds

324
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,480
for who and empowered thank you melinda

325
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,320
and harry can you give us the view from

326
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,800
london

327
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,360
yes of course um i think it's um

328
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
important to sort of draw out a couple

329
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,560
of the things that uh my esteemed

330
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,440
fellow panelists mentioned and in

331
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,959
particular it's this this underlying

332
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:47,839
issue of of

333
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,480
trust and i think it's important to

334
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,680
acknowledge

335
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,320
um that disinformation doesn't create

336
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,760
create divisions or create

337
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,240
these kind of beliefs but what it does

338
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,240
is land an environment where it

339
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,399
exacerbates them and it really

340
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,600
different actors with different

341
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,680
motivations really

342
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,959
try to exploit that for for their own

343
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,240
purposes

344
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,959
and when we're looking at the issue here

345
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:17,760
i think

346
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,680
you know it does come down to trust but

347
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,279
we need to disaggregate

348
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,480
exactly what that trust is in

349
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,920
trust in this context is not just about

350
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,600
trust in the product i.e the vaccine

351
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
but it's also very much about trust in

352
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
the institutions that are developing

353
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,600
supplying and administering

354
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,279
the vaccine and belief that those

355
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
institutions have

356
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,200
um public interest and interest of

357
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,560
different groups

358
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,360
at heart and of course this is all

359
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,279
happening in a context that i know

360
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,760
uh globsex discussed at length in

361
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,240
previous years which is a general trend

362
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,839
of declining trust

363
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,240
uh in in government institutions uh

364
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,440
worldwide and

365
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,200
that's sort of widely highlighted in a

366
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
number of surveys but notably of course

367
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,880
the edelman trust barometer

368
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
and so we need to make sure that we are

369
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,480
working

370
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
in a way that um understands exactly how

371
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
we can overcome those barriers with

372
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,440
different groups

373
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,519
and i think about the challenge here as

374
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,880
being one of

375
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,160
uh supply and demand uh for

376
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
accurate information and when it comes

377
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,600
to how we use strategic communications

378
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
part of what we need to do is to

379
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
actually create demand

380
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,040
for accurate information and there are a

381
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,079
number of campaigns and activities that

382
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,399
the uk has has developed and worked on

383
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,160
with our partners to

384
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,079
help uh nudge um

385
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,800
populations to seek out accurate

386
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,880
information but also to be able to

387
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,760
detect

388
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,040
inaccurate uh information um and then of

389
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,800
course on the supply side

390
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,760
um it's a case of ensuring that accurate

391
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,839
information is brought to those

392
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,800
audiences

393
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
in a way that they find trustful

394
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
domestically in the uk

395
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,000
uh we've uh we're lucky enough to enjoy

396
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,240
high levels of vaccine confidence

397
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,800
overall with over 70 percent

398
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,519
of the uk population um saying they

399
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:17,920
would

400
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,920
accept the vaccine and of course when

401
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,440
you look at how the

402
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,920
uh the the vaccine hesitant population

403
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
actually breaks out according to

404
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,199
different demographic categories you'll

405
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,160
find that that's

406
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,720
significantly higher in certain um in

407
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,600
certain groups

408
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
there's a case of finding the trusted

409
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
messengers and that we can that we can

410
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,839
bring them accurate information

411
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,279
uh with um so the view from the uk

412
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,360
domestically i think is that you know we

413
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,040
we um

414
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
are lucky enough to enjoy relatively

415
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,639
overall high levels of vaccine

416
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,560
confidence and we're working to

417
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,199
find the best way to uh encourage

418
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
confidence among those uh

419
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,880
other groups whilst also recognizing

420
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,480
that we can work with our partners

421
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,000
around the world to

422
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,160
use strategic communications to boost

423
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,839
vaccine confidence in

424
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,720
a number of different ways um including

425
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,079
through working with the world health

426
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,760
organization

427
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,760
and henry you mentioned trusted

428
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,360
messengers and i'm curious

429
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,079
where where you've seen the most success

430
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:18,480
um

431
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,160
like i remember there was a great

432
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
campaign was it elton john

433
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,279
you had advocating for for getting the

434
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,160
job and

435
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,720
you you've kind of drawn on yeah to

436
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,160
everything from celebrities

437
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
to to obviously yeah other public

438
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,079
leaders so i'm curious

439
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,040
um where you've what you've seen are

440
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,480
particularly successful campaigns from

441
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,759
messengers yeah yeah yeah sure

442
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,519
no celebrities are great and

443
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,040
particularly when you're thinking about

444
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,560
you know appealing to

445
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,839
um to finding individuals that resonate

446
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,680
with specific audiences and they have

447
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,000
quite

448
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,639
broad appeal um and when we think about

449
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,480
youth audiences of course it's a great

450
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
way to engage them because

451
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,519
you know they're not going to be

452
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,360
necessarily listening to mainstream news

453
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
and they don't want to hear from

454
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,399
politicians and so you can find people

455
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,240
that you know sports stars musicians

456
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,279
that they really

457
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,120
uh that they already follow on social

458
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
media and they're going to

459
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
they're going to pick up that content

460
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,759
just through their routine

461
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,560
sort of um information consumption

462
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,519
activity

463
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,440
but i think the most important ones

464
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,279
aren't the aren't the high profile ones

465
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,040
and it's actually bringing the messaging

466
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,600
down

467
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,880
um to the uh to as local level

468
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,959
as possible and finding individuals that

469
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:31,920
are influential

470
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,320
influential with specific communities

471
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,000
like uh religious leaders

472
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,480
uh health professionals um so just

473
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,040
anecdotally as i um

474
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,519
walk out of my stairwell in my building

475
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,519
in the morning and i live in a central

476
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,399
area of london

477
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,560
very diverse communities and so there's

478
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,600
an image of

479
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
an imam uh who works in the local

480
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,000
community uh talking uh about his

481
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,160
confidence in the vaccine uh on a poster

482
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,680
in the stairwell and it's you know

483
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,519
bringing these very local voices that

484
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,759
are recognized in small communities

485
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,559
um to the fore uh that is essential to

486
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,319
build trust

487
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,319
i imagine that's a challenge for an

488
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,559
organization like the who that's working

489
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,760
globally like

490
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,160
when just covering this issue over a

491
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,160
decade you see how

492
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
even making generalizations about

493
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,760
vaccine hesitancy in a country are

494
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,959
difficult because

495
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,400
it's so these these um yeah pockets of

496
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
refusal tend to be

497
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,200
pockets like extremely local and um with

498
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
it with very specific

499
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,960
um community-based concerns

500
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,679
no yeah that's true i mean i think uh

501
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,520
from the world health organization at

502
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,760
the the global level

503
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,679
every time we communicate anything we

504
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,200
have to think who are we communicating

505
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,520
to

506
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,160
now is it the 15 year old in kenya is it

507
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,960
the

508
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
you know 75 year old grandmother in

509
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,320
costa rica

510
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
um we have a huge audience and so it

511
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,919
does um

512
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,360
and i think miroslava mentioned this

513
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,120
earlier too just

514
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,760
vaccine hesitancy in particular is a

515
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,440
very very nuanced

516
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,679
issue it's it's the somebody's

517
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,120
questioning the vaccine could be very

518
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,919
valid

519
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,280
um i think a lot of what we're seeing

520
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,080
actually in in europe right now

521
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,679
isn't so much people questioning the

522
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,760
vaccine although there is some of that

523
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
uh it's people's ease of access to get

524
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,960
to the back

525
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,799
get vaccine it's not as easy in some

526
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,039
locations to get it as it is others

527
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,760
um but just to touch on what henry was

528
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,679
mentioning in terms of trusted

529
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,679
sources of information this is something

530
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,760
that the who has been working on and

531
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,840
even prior to coping 19

532
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,799
we started a network called the who

533
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,720
information network for epidemics

534
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,600
and the sole purpose of this network we

535
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,720
call it epi win

536
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
was to be able to reach out through

537
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,720
trusted sources of information

538
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,760
and we really are targeting three

539
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,480
partner networks one is youth to reach

540
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,080
out to this very unique population

541
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,640
it's critically important now uh during

542
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,600
vaccine because

543
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
with the vaccine rollout of coba 19

544
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
we're we're targeting

545
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
populations that aren't usually targeted

546
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
for vaccines so it's a unique situation

547
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
in that respect

548
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
we also are working through faith

549
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,280
organizations as well

550
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,039
and working side by side with them we've

551
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
done some very exciting initiatives

552
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,440
where we've

553
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,400
co-written guidance together with faith

554
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,720
organizations to better target

555
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,960
their trusted constituents um through

556
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,240
these methods and we work

557
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,679
of course all over the world so very

558
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,360
very different circumstances and

559
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,440
different countries and and and

560
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
communities as well

561
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,919
and we're also working through the

562
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,600
business sector because we've known from

563
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,520
the past as henry indicated

564
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
through and adam and the barometer trust

565
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,559
that that

566
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,000
oftentimes people really trust

567
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,760
information that are coming from their

568
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,919
employer networks as well so we've tried

569
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,200
to work through those

570
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,320
mechanisms as well um in terms of choice

571
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,200
of vaccine

572
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,480
we're seeing that globally and also in

573
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,600
europe too

574
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,799
a female population is often

575
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,559
a little bit more hesitant than male

576
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,000
population so we're trying to

577
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,039
kind of work around that issue as well

578
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,640
and um yeah i think at this point it's

579
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,240
we're beyond the global messaging on

580
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
this everything has to become much much

581
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,360
more nuanced

582
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,440
and we're really targeting efforts

583
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,200
around community engagement and

584
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
empowerment community-led initiatives

585
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
to reach out to individuals to have

586
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,360
those individual conversations so that

587
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,159
people can

588
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,640
truly get their very valid questions

589
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
answered through trusted

590
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,840
trusted networks and that can often be

591
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,400
the healthcare providers as well

592
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,159
wonderful and i want to turn to

593
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,600
solutions in a moment but

594
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,799
first um we have some research from

595
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,080
miroslava

596
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,360
in a poll um so what proportion can

597
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,440
can can we bring up the poll actually so

598
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,679
everyone can see it

599
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,280
there we go so what proportion of the

600
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,200
adult population across central and

601
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
eastern europe

602
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,400
believe that covid is a planned

603
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
operation or conspiracy

604
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
by the hidden forces and elites to

605
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,679
control the population

606
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,120
if everyone could submit an answer 8

607
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,239
18 28 38

608
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
uh how long do we usually give for these

609
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,559
polls

610
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
of our precious time think it's out

611
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,280
there oh there we go okay

612
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,120
okay interesting

613
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,000
so i can say that people are a bit more

614
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
optimistic

615
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,799
than they should be okay so it's not 18

616
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,400
percent across cee is actually 28

617
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,919
across cee so it's fairly fairly

618
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,880
large proportion of the population and

619
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,679
um

620
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,919
the reason why we looked at this uh

621
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,400
so-called plandemic conspiracy theory is

622
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,280
because

623
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,240
um we wanted to by you know observing

624
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,240
what's going on on social media because

625
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,840
you know plundering and

626
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,200
this kind of um let's say

627
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,600
what should be fringe conspiracy

628
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,720
theories are

629
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,200
not generally seen on mainstream media

630
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,720
and most of the ce

631
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,000
countries um so this is something that's

632
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
definitely being

633
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,280
perpetuated online and we just wanted to

634
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,000
kind of test the impact of the you know

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,240
digital environment on on the way we

636
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
form our opinions about

637
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
about the pandemic and obviously again

638
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,600
this is a

639
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,559
average number for a whole cee so it's

640
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,320
worse in some countries and

641
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,880
and better in some countries but it just

642
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,960
goes to show you the power that these

643
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,679
types of

644
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,120
um conspiracy theories have and it's

645
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,960
quite also interesting that

646
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,240
you see this perpetuation of

647
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
disinformation narratives about covet 19

648
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,760
globally so

649
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,919
whereas before you know the digital

650
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:48,880
revolution

651
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
conspiracy theories were always kind of

652
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
part of our lives let's not pretend that

653
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
it was ever any different

654
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,559
but what we see right now is this

655
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,640
perpetuation of conspiracy theories

656
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,200
which are

657
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,320
truly global so um something that alex

658
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,159
jones from infowars was

659
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,840
adamantly you know promoting in the u.s

660
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,919
was professionally voiced over into

661
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:10,559
slovak

662
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,600
a very professional actor um yes very

663
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
nicely sounding voice-over

664
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,000
and it was a video shared on facebook

665
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,559
which was shared 16 000 times which by

666
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,159
slovak standards is like

667
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,120
extremely large number and obviously um

668
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,320
facebook

669
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,799
did in cooperation with independent fact

670
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,600
checkers

671
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
fact checked this video and it always

672
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,360
came with this little disclaimer you

673
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
know that the information in this video

674
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,120
is factually incorrect but that didn't

675
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,760
really

676
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,320
stop the promotion of the video and so

677
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,200
then you see

678
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
all these um basically perpetuation of

679
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,240
conspiracy theories from all kinds of

680
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,960
you know

681
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,320
corners of the world and they influence

682
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,799
very specific local communities which

683
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,919
previously they

684
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,679
wouldn't actually be able wouldn't

685
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,360
actually be able to reach so

686
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,400
i just wanted to also by showing this

687
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,400
poll um demonstrate um the power

688
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,240
of this information and the power of

689
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
conspiracy theories and

690
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,279
obviously the issues that this poses to

691
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,520
vaccination efforts and

692
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,640
to just overcoming the pandemic and we

693
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,000
have a question from the audience

694
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,440
that's that's related um so so

695
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,120
someone oh we have another question from

696
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
the audience okay we'll do the first

697
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,000
question

698
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,159
so what are some of the dividing lines

699
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,000
between those who are more

700
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,120
and less prone to believing or to being

701
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
disinformed and misinformed

702
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,600
um we've talked about yeah a lot of the

703
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,120
things that we're drawing in are these

704
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,400
longer term

705
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,240
challenges like trust in government

706
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,159
maybe educational gaps

707
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,600
and i'm wondering if yeah what we're

708
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
learning now in the pandemic

709
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,960
um yeah where where these dividing lines

710
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,080
might fall

711
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
that's a very good question and again

712
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,840
it's not as easy as it seems like

713
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,080
intuitively we would say that you know

714
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,320
it's always people with lower education

715
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,279
who believe in

716
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,320
conspiracy theories more or um

717
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,720
that it's people in rural areas but this

718
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
isn't always the case so

719
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
when we look at different countries the

720
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
picture is quite different or sometimes

721
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,240
it's the younger generation who is more

722
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,080
prone than the older generation which

723
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,720
also seems kind of counterintuitive

724
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,720
so how we were talking melinda and henry

725
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,200
both

726
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,279
quite correctly pointing out that

727
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,279
strategy communication requires

728
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,760
tailoring that you need to tailor

729
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,520
specific message to

730
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,200
the audience that you're targeting

731
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,799
because that will resonate

732
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,000
and in similar way this information

733
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,760
works too so it's sort of like

734
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,440
you know the dark side of the

735
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,799
information spectrum

736
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,080
so certain um types of disinformation or

737
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,400
certain types of conspiracy theories

738
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,200
resonate among different sections of the

739
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,480
population more

740
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
and we know many examples of this and

741
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,039
often as henry pointed out they

742
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,919
feed into pre-existing fears or even

743
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
legitimate grievances

744
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,120
so for example um you know

745
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,960
the conspiracy theory that has been

746
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,720
spread in the past about

747
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,000
about the hiv virus uh that you know um

748
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,679
there was a conspiracy theory that

749
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,640
basically

750
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,600
uh it has been invented you know um this

751
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,039
has been spread by uh

752
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,080
by pro-russian actors that that this um

753
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,960
hiv virus was produced by the us

754
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,279
you know and so in some parts of of

755
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,279
africa these types of conspiracy

756
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,000
theories

757
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,080
can result can resonate for for

758
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,679
different reasons you know or for

759
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,799
example

760
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,720
conspiracy or disinformation about

761
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,840
migration

762
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,880
resonates strongly in hungary because of

763
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,440
you know the current regime because of

764
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,919
the migration crisis that has been blown

765
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,120
out of proportion

766
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
but when you look at this information

767
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,840
about kovid 19 in hungary

768
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,240
actually you will find that hungary is

769
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,600
one one of the more

770
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
resistant countries towards this type of

771
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,000
misinformation and you will see that

772
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,240
other countries such as in the western

773
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,640
balkans or even in slovakia

774
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,360
is much more receptive to to these types

775
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,400
of

776
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,640
conspiracy theories and yes it has got

777
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,080
to do a lot with

778
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,600
with trust in institutions or mistrust

779
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,159
in in government or or in mainstream

780
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,039
media

781
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,480
so it depends and one dividing line that

782
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,919
melinda brought up is the

783
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,399
the gender dividing line which i didn't

784
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,360
realize was a

785
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,320
it sounds like it's a global issue that

786
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,679
that women

787
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,240
are more hesitant than men and do we

788
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,559
understand

789
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,840
yeah what do we understand about that

790
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,520
i don't think we quite understand

791
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,360
everything about that and it's just a

792
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,200
slight trend that we're seeing that i

793
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,679
think is

794
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,799
sort of surprising a lot of us um

795
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,799
potentially maybe henry knows more about

796
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,120
the situation in the uk

797
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,960
um but i do want to kind of bridge off

798
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,840
of what miroslava was saying in terms of

799
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,039
this divide and i think a lot of our gut

800
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,200
reactions before this would have been

801
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
um again trust in government trust in

802
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,120
leaders that's what we've sort of always

803
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,039
known during an emergency

804
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,960
you can't build trust in the middle of

805
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
an emergency it has to be the foundation

806
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,559
from which you start prior to an

807
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,760
emergency

808
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,039
um so if there was a foundation of maybe

809
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,799
not even lack of trust in the government

810
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,039
but just maybe a bad experience with the

811
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,720
public health system

812
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,840
that's going to affect people's

813
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,159
perception um

814
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,559
on whether or not you know responders

815
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,640
have their best interests in mind

816
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,200
have the capability to manage this can

817
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,919
get their

818
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,919
questions answered answered and and

819
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,520
really understand the lives in which

820
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,080
people

821
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,399
are leading and this is um common to

822
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,320
focus more now than ever

823
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
i mean we've seen you know countries

824
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,480
that have never necessarily

825
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,840
had to rely on community mechanisms for

826
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
engagement strategies really have to do

827
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,520
this now and then those

828
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,760
those uh those mechanisms may not have

829
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,679
been in place in some western european

830
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,720
countries

831
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,200
or in higher income countries and yet

832
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,039
they really needed them during

833
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,159
during um during this response

834
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,159
uh also i think one of the trends we're

835
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,679
starting to pick up is that

836
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,080
individuals that rely on information

837
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,840
through more maybe more traditional

838
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,799
media

839
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,080
um maybe televised or written

840
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,360
media tend to not be so

841
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,760
susceptible to disinformation because

842
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,039
there's an opportunity

843
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,640
to have more of a discourse in those

844
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,120
types of media so they can hear the pros

845
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,760
the cons the arguments for and against

846
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,240
whereas potentially with social media

847
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,399
there's just little sort of snippets of

848
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,080
information and not as much of a chance

849
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,120
to sort of really

850
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,320
um dissect an issue so we're

851
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,760
tending it we're beginning to see that

852
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,840
kind of trend as well so where people

853
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,200
seek their information could really have

854
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,399
a factor on whether or not they're

855
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:53,520
susceptible

856
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,799
to to disinformation

857
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,279
great and i have a question from the

858
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,000
audience

859
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,679
um through the app and by the way if

860
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,080
anyone in the room has questions please

861
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,200
feel free to to go to the

862
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,399
mic in the corner here so so one that i

863
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,840
wanted to direct at

864
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,240
henry how do you see the responsibility

865
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,840
of vaccine producers

866
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,159
and the medical establishment more

867
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,240
widely for communicating to the public

868
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,840
when governments are mistrusted

869
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,120
yeah that's an excellent question um and

870
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,679
of course

871
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,279
um vaccine producers tend to be global

872
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,799
pharmaceutical companies they have quite

873
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,279
large

874
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,520
marketing budgets i think you know um

875
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
it's in their interest to

876
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,799
uh to actually use that to promote the

877
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,640
vaccine um

878
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,559
to um to uh patients and customers

879
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,000
um and and within that to identify

880
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,279
um exactly um what kind of barriers

881
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,559
there might be to

882
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,600
uh to promoting the vaccine uh to them

883
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,840
i think in doing that process though i

884
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,760
think um and this is something not just

885
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,960
for the vaccine

886
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,279
produces but for us more generally when

887
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,799
we think about public health

888
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,840
as a national priority at the moment is

889
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,360
is the need to prioritize these

890
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,399
different audiences

891
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,240
and the last question about dividing

892
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,159
lines i thought was you know a very good

893
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:17,600
one because it really got to the heart

894
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,000
of what

895
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,440
are the different motivations that

896
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,200
people have with different reasons

897
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,840
that people have for being hesitant and

898
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,640
melinda sort of

899
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
picked out a really good range of them

900
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,480
and you know

901
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,240
at one end you have people yes that

902
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,399
believe in conspiracy theories

903
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,519
um and you know that correlates with um

904
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,600
in in our research looking at the uk

905
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,039
when we've tried to understand

906
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,960
where disinformation lands and why it

907
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,120
gets traction we see that sort of the

908
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
propensity to believe conspiracy

909
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,000
theories actually

910
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,840
correlates with the political extremes

911
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
and they're actually very hard audiences

912
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,880
to win over

913
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,039
um but but there's a spectrum and a

914
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,039
range it's not that there is a line over

915
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,720
which certainly someone doesn't want the

916
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,320
vaccine you know there are a range of

917
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,039
different

918
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,120
um different reasons that people are

919
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,240
hesitant and and

920
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,440
and you know uh in terms of reaching our

921
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:05,840
goal

922
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,000
in this instance which is vaccinating as

923
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,519
many of the population as

924
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,200
possible in support of our pathway out

925
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,720
of the pandemic

926
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,799
we need to prioritize those audiences

927
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,720
and understand exactly how we can win

928
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,440
over

929
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
most of them and recognize that some of

930
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,600
them will be unreconcilable

931
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,600
um and you know i think generally when

932
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,200
we've thought about disinformation in

933
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,000
other contexts

934
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,760
when we for example in the wake of the

935
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,600
salisbury attack when the uk was dealing

936
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,120
with a disinformation

937
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,760
attack from the russian state we

938
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,880
recognized that there were some

939
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,960
audiences in the uk for whom the russian

940
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,200
state's narrative about the events

941
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,440
um would always resonate and because

942
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,320
they had

943
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,840
because they inherently believe in these

944
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
kind of conspiracy uh

945
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,080
theories and uh what the important thing

946
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,120
was that those

947
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,200
uh narratives didn't break into the

948
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,039
mainstream and didn't start to influence

949
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,240
and they stay in these

950
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,880
echo chambers at each end of the

951
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,240
political spectrum

952
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,559
and so recognizing which audiences we

953
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,919
can actually

954
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,399
inform and bring accurate information to

955
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,200
i think is

956
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,279
is key and of course yes the vaccine

957
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,399
producers play

958
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,200
play a role in that that's a great point

959
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,519
and it's also such a dynamic environment

960
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,840
um in the uk you're changing the

961
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,360
guidance in which

962
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,120
and i guess in every country which

963
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,039
vaccines are coming online

964
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,720
which are being used i know in the us

965
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
the vaccine vaccine hesitancy has

966
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,559
actually gotten better over time as more

967
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,320
people are

968
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,399
being vaccinated and you know you talk

969
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,559
to your friends and family and hear that

970
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,919
maybe they didn't have a terrible

971
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:40,480
experience and terrible side effects and

972
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,039
that increases your willingness to um to

973
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,840
get the job

974
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,679
so yeah it's a it's a highly dynamic and

975
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,840
interesting and challenging environment

976
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,279
so we have a question here from the

977
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,480
audience please

978
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,399
um introduce yourself and state the

979
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,240
question as a question

980
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,640
hi uh yes uh good morning i'm anja

981
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,399
nussbaum i'm a journalist for bloomberg

982
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:01,600
news

983
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,159
and i have a question about the need to

984
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:05,279
reconcile

985
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,960
the legitimate um queries about the

986
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,599
origin

987
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,839
the legitimate need to to to query about

988
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,079
the origin of the virus

989
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,839
and the need to fight conspiracy

990
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,359
theories and what i mean is that

991
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,280
last year a lot of us were very quick to

992
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,839
dismiss um

993
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,079
the thesis about the origin of the virus

994
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,599
coming from johann

995
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,520
accidental non-accidental doesn't matter

996
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,879
but a lot of us were very quick to

997
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,960
dismiss that because it was a theory

998
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,679
that was

999
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,839
spread by donald trump basically and and

1000
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,159
a certain part of the political spectrum

1001
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,320
uh this year the this is being discussed

1002
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,079
again you know we're

1003
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,000
seeing more and more uh questions from

1004
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,320
scientists about the origin of the virus

1005
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,918
and whether or not uh these um these

1006
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,359
theories are true uh how do you

1007
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,159
reconcile the need to investigate

1008
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,480
uh and uh they need not to dismiss

1009
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,119
certain theories and they need to also

1010
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,200
you know make sure that people don't

1011
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
don't go crazy over

1012
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,720
all the crazy theories the question

1013
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,520
yes absolutely great question i think

1014
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,119
the issue always is when

1015
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,880
a legitimate question becomes

1016
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
politicized because

1017
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,560
this is exactly what would happen you

1018
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,079
know in the case of donald trump

1019
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,160
it was so clear to everyone that there

1020
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,800
is an ulterior motive to this and then

1021
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,880
it becomes really difficult to take this

1022
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,400
notion seriously

1023
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,320
but i think the reconciling part um

1024
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,520
comes when we and this has been repeated

1025
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,800
so often during

1026
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,560
during the pandemic that i'm not going

1027
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,000
to say anything new

1028
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,160
but it's basically trusting the experts

1029
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,079
who are actually doing the research and

1030
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,119
giving them

1031
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,079
voice which is not politicized and

1032
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:44,880
giving them

1033
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,280
the floor and the space to speak

1034
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
authoritatively on some of these things

1035
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,640
and also it's about not jumping to

1036
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,800
conclusions very quickly because i think

1037
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,040
it's okay to tell to your audience

1038
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,160
that this is you know one hypothesis

1039
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,400
and it's just one hypothesis which needs

1040
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,720
to be explored which needs to be checked

1041
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,040
and then needs to be proven true or

1042
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,720
wrong essentially

1043
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,040
but um there's big difference between

1044
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,880
when somebody just like

1045
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,960
throws around you know these notions

1046
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,119
without any kind of evidence

1047
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,520
so i think it's about and this sort of

1048
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,640
fits into

1049
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,680
a broader issue of how we even how the

1050
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,400
media

1051
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,960
and how politicians and how public

1052
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,000
authorities

1053
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,720
communicate potentially very complex

1054
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,760
issues

1055
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,040
to public audiences in an in an

1056
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,320
understandable

1057
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,000
manner essentially and it's very

1058
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,880
difficult so i understand like oh

1059
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,640
majority of stakeholders made some

1060
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,720
mistakes over the past you know

1061
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,400
one and a half year in terms of

1062
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,240
communicating the pandemic because the

1063
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,560
situation develops so rapidly

1064
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,920
that actually having safe knowledge of

1065
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,560
of

1066
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,240
what is actually going on is being

1067
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,960
constantly changed and updated

1068
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,960
but again i think that needs to be

1069
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,119
communicated to the audiences as well

1070
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:03,760
that

1071
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,400
okay this thing is new for all of us and

1072
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
we are still in the process

1073
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,359
of of finding out so if that is

1074
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,280
you know um sort of communicated well

1075
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
then i think the audiences are able to

1076
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,040
understand it

1077
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,359
but people will always you know try to

1078
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,520
use these things for their political and

1079
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,640
so

1080
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,480
i think from a journalist journalist

1081
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,839
perspective um

1082
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:30,000
this this intellectual humility too at

1083
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,320
the beginning of the pandemic to say

1084
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,560
you know there are there is tremendous

1085
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,079
uncertainty about the efficacy

1086
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,560
of face mass or about the origin of the

1087
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,400
virus and to not be

1088
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,440
too quick to be reactionary as well we

1089
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,160
only have

1090
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
four and a half minutes left and i did

1091
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,520
want to talk about

1092
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,079
solutions so i'm curious from your

1093
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:51,839
various perspectives

1094
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,440
we're obviously living through these

1095
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,920
policy experiments all over the world

1096
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,079
and whether you've seen particularly

1097
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,520
effective

1098
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,560
methods for combating disinformation and

1099
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,400
this longer term and more challenging

1100
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,640
project of building trust

1101
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,160
and and education as well

1102
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,480
um maybe we could start with henry

1103
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,359
yeah sure i mean there's a lot of

1104
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,800
different bits to that question and i'll

1105
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,040
try not to take up all the time um

1106
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,440
but i think i mean quickly from our

1107
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,160
perspective

1108
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,800
strategic communications is is is a key

1109
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,520
lever in

1110
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,320
uh in promoting vaccine confidence um

1111
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,760
and you know i touched earlier on the

1112
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,240
reason

1113
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,359
on some of the things that make it

1114
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,280
effective but in terms of

1115
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,680
um in terms of particularly effective

1116
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,599
activity that we've seen and

1117
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,280
and support there's a um

1118
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,440
[Music]

1119
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,240
an app game called go viral which was

1120
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,359
developed

1121
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:49,200
in partnership with university of

1122
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,720
cambridge

1123
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,640
that uses behavioral insights to

1124
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,598
to inoculate

1125
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,599
individuals against misinformation by

1126
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:02,880
having them play the part

1127
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,400
of someone that is spreading false

1128
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,000
information online in

1129
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,640
in this simulation um and it's been

1130
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,040
proven that just one play of the game

1131
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,520
uh reduces uh the perceived uh

1132
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
reliability of fake news by an average

1133
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,800
of 21

1134
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,599
and the their their then immunity to uh

1135
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,200
false information lasts up to three

1136
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,880
months so it's important to note that

1137
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,640
all of these behavioral interventions do

1138
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,560
have a sort of skill fade to the nudge

1139
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,359
that you've

1140
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,800
uh you've had with them but yeah we've

1141
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,960
translated that into multiple languages

1142
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,599
and um

1143
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,320
shared it with multiple partners and uh

1144
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,720
and

1145
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,240
um yeah it's it's proven to have a

1146
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,760
behavioral impact on them

1147
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,880
i think longer term uh the importance uh

1148
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
the important thing for for us and i

1149
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,640
think uh it's reflected by some of our

1150
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,440
allies

1151
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,680
is thinking about about three things and

1152
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,359
it's it's it's stuff that's reflected in

1153
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,160
the uk's

1154
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,320
recent integrated review which is a refu

1155
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,079
review of security and defense but of

1156
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:56,640
course

1157
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,520
features uh health security uh more than

1158
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,119
previous reviews have them

1159
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,160
uh all of uh all of uh our security

1160
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,000
priorities need to be based on

1161
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,520
uh on building resilience uh on on

1162
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,599
sharing and promoting our values and

1163
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,359
then finally of course on international

1164
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,480
cooperation with

1165
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,079
uh with other nations and and with

1166
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,839
multilateral organizations and i think

1167
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:18,640
those are

1168
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,240
those are the things that will help us

1169
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,599
build trust those are the things that

1170
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,400
will help us

1171
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,920
uh through the pandemic and those are

1172
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,440
the things that will

1173
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,839
help us build back better as the world

1174
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,640
and melinda um i'll echo

1175
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,480
some of what henry said too i think at

1176
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,000
least at the world health organization

1177
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,480
we are looking at ways to help countries

1178
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,560
and communities become more resilient

1179
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,720
for the next uh pandemic or next

1180
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,319
emergency because there will be one

1181
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,839
unfortunately

1182
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,079
some of the things we're doing to help

1183
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,440
countries really

1184
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,400
begin to regain more of that trust

1185
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:54,960
factor

1186
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,359
before the next emergencies we've

1187
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,119
started a new platform it's a country

1188
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,319
based tool called the

1189
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:03,040
early ai supported response with social

1190
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,800
listening it enables countries to kind

1191
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,720
of pick up potential missing

1192
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,599
disinformation

1193
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,960
in their own information ecosystem

1194
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,560
in their country and it also allows them

1195
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,960
to triangulate other epidemiologic data

1196
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,560
to kind of really see what's going on in

1197
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,760
their own country

1198
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,359
we're supporting that we also have a

1199
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,520
research agenda for epidemics so we can

1200
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,720
learn more about

1201
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,599
the impact of the epidemic the spread of

1202
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,319
information

1203
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,720
and misinformation and really to learn

1204
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,560
more about the tools and the mechanisms

1205
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,839
that we can employ that may

1206
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,480
help uh decrease the amount of

1207
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,720
misinformation disinformation

1208
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,319
and help to inoculate the population

1209
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,760
against that too so these are some of

1210
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,280
the things we're looking forward to

1211
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,160
in the future and i guess what the other

1212
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,800
major

1213
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,480
theme here that we keep touching on is

1214
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,160
obviously at this this building

1215
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,880
trust in in populations and down to the

1216
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,800
level of specific communities

1217
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,359
so to wrap up could we talk a little bit

1218
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,960
right about what government should be

1219
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,240
doing now

1220
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,119
um to prepare for the next one and this

1221
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,920
is yes

1222
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,240
there was an audience member who had a

1223
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,920
question along these lines in terms

1224
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,560
in terms of communications um what

1225
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,920
should we be doing now to prepare the

1226
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,800
public for the next pandemic

1227
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,480
so this is a tough one for some

1228
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,480
governments obviously the uk is doing

1229
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,319
really well so i think it's always good

1230
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:20,240
to share best practice and and learn

1231
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,079
from those who are really succeeding you

1232
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,599
know because there are plenty of

1233
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:25,680
countries also in ce who

1234
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,560
are struggling with this part and who

1235
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,560
are not being trusted

1236
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,599
by their constituents because um they

1237
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,319
are considered to have you know dealt

1238
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,160
with the second wave of the pandemic

1239
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,920
really poorly as we have now

1240
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,160
um we all know that the cee has been

1241
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,280
very much

1242
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,359
very badly affected by the second wave

1243
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,800
of the pandemic so

1244
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,440
rebuilding trust in such an environment

1245
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,200
is extremely difficult

1246
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,440
but i do believe that we've mentioned it

1247
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,880
already efficient strategic

1248
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,200
communication is absolutely the key

1249
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,640
but also um you know it's about creating

1250
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,920
really modern

1251
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,720
campaigns information campaigns which

1252
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,760
could actually

1253
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,280
reach those who who need to who need to

1254
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,319
get vaccinated and this has proven to be

1255
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,680
a problem in some countries um obviously

1256
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
the willingness to get vaccinated has

1257
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,359
increased so that's the good news

1258
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,119
and there are also large bookies of

1259
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,800
people who are undecided about

1260
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,079
vaccinations so

1261
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,319
across eu there's like 20 of the

1262
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,079
population so

1263
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,119
if governments focus their efforts on on

1264
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:31,839
actually these

1265
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,280
undecided um undecided constituents

1266
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,400
then perhaps you know um that's one way

1267
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,000
of overcoming hopefully

1268
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,319
this one pandemic and in the long term

1269
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:43,520
it's all about building

1270
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,359
efficient institutions but that's

1271
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,599
obviously not something you can

1272
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,920
you know change within half a year or a

1273
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,839
year that's definitely a long-term

1274
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:52,800
project

1275
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,560
and the the other long-term project that

1276
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,319
i'm picking up on we need to clone

1277
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,680
henry or send him to um yeah

1278
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,760
these different places to replicate the

1279
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,440
uk experience

1280
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,960
um no that that's really helpful

1281
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,560
was there anything that henry and

1282
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,839
melinda wanted to add

1283
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,119
uh well yeah i mean um

1284
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,040
we do work internationally with a lot of

1285
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,800
our partners to help build strategic

1286
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,480
communications capability and i think

1287
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,160
you know it's important to recognize

1288
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,359
that um that the uk is uh

1289
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,520
very keen to make sure that we help as

1290
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,280
many of our partners as possible

1291
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,960
and just on that great point about you

1292
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,480
know what what prepares us for the next

1293
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,400
pandemic i think the way we make our way

1294
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,240
out of this pandemic

1295
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,000
will build trust we should do it in a

1296
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,520
way that means that we

1297
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,680
um build trust that means that the world

1298
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,760
will be more ready for the next one and

1299
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,920
of course you know sharing vaccines

1300
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,760
is is going to be a key part of that and

1301
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,599
that's why we were delighted that one of

1302
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,839
the outcomes of the g7

1303
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,720
summit uh earlier this week was that the

1304
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,119
announcement of a billion vaccines to be

1305
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:57,839
donated

1306
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,880
to uh lower-income countries um and you

1307
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,560
know it's that kind of display

1308
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,839
uh and you know symbolic gesture of our

1309
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,760
values that will ensure there is

1310
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,839
trust in the international system that

1311
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,960
uh that we will come

1312
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,359
out of this uh as a globe next time

1313
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,800
absolutely yeah well thank you so so

1314
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,280

app

1317
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:26,000
in the audience in geneva and london um

1318
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,880
and i think yeah it seems like there are

1319
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,359
no

1320
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,280
really easy solutions to this problem

1321
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,720
and we need to start

1322
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,560
certainly thinking about the next one

1323
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,800
right now um so thank you for sharing

1324
