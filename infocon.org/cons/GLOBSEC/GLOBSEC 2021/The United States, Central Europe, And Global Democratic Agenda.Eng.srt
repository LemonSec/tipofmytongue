you today

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,479
because one of the major topics of

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,600
conversation here

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
at this globe sec has been what happened

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,439
yesterday in geneva there's been a lot

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,080
of speculation

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
and now we are joined by someone who i

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
believe was actually in the room

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,560
um still it's the third day a lot of

37
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
people stayed up late last night

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
reading about the outcome of the summit

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,119
so i thought we could start with a bit

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,240
of a role play

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
if you would just squint your eyes a

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,439
little bit uh and imagine that i'm

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,960
vladimir silenski

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,640
and i want to know if i should be

45
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,479
hopeful or a bit despondent

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,399
after yesterday's summit uh what would

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,320
you tell me is the biden administration

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,560
leaving ukrainians out to dry

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,399
well valerie first of all it's great to

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,479
be here with all of you at globesac

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,280
uh congratulations on a great conference

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,399
and i'm really

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,600
happy to be joining you again president

54
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,719
biden

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,959
as he always does stood by ukraine

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,080
as america has made clear to president

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,040
putin

58
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,360
that ukraine's uh sovereignty

59
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,160
independence

60
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,640
and territorial integrity are something

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,120
that we are profoundly committed to

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,400
and we will continue to support ukraine

63
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,319
as she works to strengthen

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,360
her own democracy work on issues of

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,720
economy security prosperity

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,840
anti-corruption and that this is one of

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
the areas where we do have a profound

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
difference with russia

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
interestingly though as you heard

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
president putin say

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,480
in his press conference

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,959
he did raise the minsk agreements

73
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,599
declared himself still committed to them

74
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
and said he would like to see the united

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,040
states participate

76
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,680
more actively in trying to see them

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,599
implemented again so we will obviously

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
take a look at that with our ukrainian

79
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,840
partners and friends

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,440
thank you so much and um what about mr

81
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,959
putin himself did you

82
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,040
per did you witness any willingness by

83
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,080
putin to engage

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,159
to change his behavior at all i mean i

85
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,000
think we came into the summit with

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
fairly low expectations but you know

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
have they been exceeded or not

88
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,239
well first of all i think you heard both

89
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,000
presidents say

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,720
that the summit and the three hours of

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,959
conversation that they had

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,519
half of it in one plus one format half

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,239
of it

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,959
with the rest of us joining was

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,840
business-like

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,440
was professional was constructive

97
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,080
our president as he said had three goals

98
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,879
to be first of all to meet leader to

99
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,360
leader

100
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,439
because he thinks that's the best way to

101
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,280
be absolutely clear

102
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,920
about where we stand and to have no

103
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
misunderstandings between us

104
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
but he made clear that what we would

105
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,680
like is a

106
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,319
stable and predictable relationship with

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,200
russia

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
that we are prepared to cooperate where

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,599
we can but we will push back

110
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
on areas where we disagree including

111
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,959
profoundly

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
with regard to issues of human rights

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,000
and values

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
and the president was very clear

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
about our concern about the treatment of

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
mr navalny

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,120
about his concern about election

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,759
interference and democratic interference

119
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,919
uh in the united states about locked-up

120
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
americans about the way the russians

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,240
treat rferl and many other issues

122
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,960
and and said very clearly to president

123
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,680
putin

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,520
that he will continue to speak out on

125
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
these issues

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,080
um president putin heard that he also

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,639
heard

128
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,360
that when our interests are threatened

129
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
uh we will take strong action

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
so you know the question is

131
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
does president putin want also

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
a predictable and stable relationship

133
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
with the united states

134
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000
he says that he does he did yesterday he

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,600
said that he did yesterday

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
but as president biden said the the

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,360
proof of the pudding will be in the

138
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,240
eating

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
and we've set out a number of areas

140
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,080
where

141
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
we're going to try to cooperate and

142
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,759
we'll see what happens one is in the

143
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,919
area of strategic stability follow on

144
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,680
discussions about

145
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,840
nuclear and conventional weapons of

146
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,919
concern the other is in the area of

147
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,080
ransomware and cyber

148
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,880
so these will be early tests along with

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
whether we can cooperate on things like

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,240
humanitarian support to syria

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
afghanistan etc so we'll we will see

152
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
and but i will say that it was

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,759
constructive in the room

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,199
and and now we have to test uh how that

155
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
can convert

156
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,320
does that mean you're more than

157
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,080
confident that the pudding will at least

158
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,800
be edible

159
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,479
if not incredibly tasty

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,880
you know i think that's very much up to

161
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,160
mr putin we

162
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,919
started making a pudding we'll see if

163
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,199
it's edible

164
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,080
great thank you very much um we only

165
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,120
a lot of my central european colleagues

175
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,080
have uh

176
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,960
really made me want to ask you or really

177
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,800
encouraged me to ask you

178
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
about how some of these themes are

179
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
reflected here in central europe

180
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,400
so you just mentioned president biden's

181
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
clear commitment to democratic

182
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
principles and human rights

183
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
according to a recent globsec poll

184
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
authoritarian tendencies or support for

185
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,319
the idea of a strong leader

186
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,639
um have increased in the region to about

187
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,919
42 percent

188
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,919
um you know in in a lot of these central

189
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,680
european countries were witnessing

190
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,000
um the democratic backsliding eroding

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
media freedom

192
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,199
and as we saw uh recently in the

193
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,880
hungarian parliament also increasing

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,039
hostility to to human rights

195
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,520
um do you think that that central europe

196
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,880
is part of the problem or part of the

197
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,000
solution

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,199
um and how will this uh this

199
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,720
some of these democratic backsliding

200
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,800
tendencies interact with

201
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
with the need for unity on issues like

202
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,159
china and russia

203
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,800
well i think we are concerned about

204
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,639
democratic backsliding anywhere in the

205
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,000
world but particularly

206
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
some of what we've seen uh within within

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
nato and eu space

208
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
and i say this with all humility because

209
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,800
we've had our own challenges

210
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,880
as you know and we are working on those

211
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,960
things at home as well

212
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,319
but if we as nations truly believe

213
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,280
uh that democracies are the better place

214
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,400
to live

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,879
and thrive than autocracies then we've

216
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,639
got to protect

217
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,039
and constantly tend our democratic

218
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,319
gardens

219
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,080
and that's true in the united states

220
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,919
it's true in central europe it's true in

221
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,360
other parts of europe

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,160
so that means for all of us we've got to

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,680
protect human rights we've got to

224
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,520
strengthen rule of law we've got to

225
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,000
allow for free and fair and competitive

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,319
elections we've got to support freedom

227
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,280
of the press

228
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,360
independent judiciaries we've got to

229
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,120
root out corruption which kills

230
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
democracies

231
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,840
we've got to protect civil society

232
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,080
and we've got to ensure that racial

233
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
injustice discrimination on the basis of

234
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,120
religion or

235
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,360
gender or sexual orientation has no

236
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,760
place in our societies

237
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,919
and if and we've all got to work on

238
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,839
these things so we have concerns in a

239
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,240
number of countries we will continue to

240
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,799
speak out about them privately and and

241
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,919
publicly

242
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,800
but but really i think for countries

243
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
that worked

244
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,480
so hard to meet the high nato standards

245
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
they really need to protect those levels

246
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,279
of standard at home um in their own

247
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,160
interest

248
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
uh unless they wanna have their

249
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,920
countries

250
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,720
increasingly look like russia and china

251
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
and be those kind of places to live

252
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
rather than the free democracies we've

253
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,320
all aspired to

254
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
thank you the the recent globsec poll

255
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,839
has some interesting data about that

256
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,760
uh but i wanted to go to actually a

257
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,519
different data point that they have

258
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,360
um which is that according to a recent

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,040
poll from march this year

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
only 35 of central european countries

261
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,680
see the us as the preferred strategic

262
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,320
partner

263
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,959
about 60 prefer germany and here in

264
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,000
slovakia

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
only 17 percent uh listed the us as the

266
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
top preferred strategic partner with 47

267
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,519
preferring russia uh is it a priority of

268
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,200
the new administration to improve these

269
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,160
numbers

270
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
what kind of strategy do you have as a

271
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,640
gardener do you need to sow new seeds or

272
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,040
just

273
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,839
add more water

274
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,480
well i'm not sure when those polls were

275
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,399
told were were taken

276
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,760
but as president biden said across

277
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,800
his first three summits of the week at

278
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
the g7 at nato

279
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
in the u.s eu summit

280
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,279
we are back we are back to working on

281
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,320
all of the great

282
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
challenges before us as nations together

283
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,200
with our allies and partners

284
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,920
and not trying to to go it alone and

285
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,880
that means

286
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,000
uh addressing everything from covid

287
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,839
to uh economic recovery to

288
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,320
fairness and transparency to ensuring

289
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,839
that we the democracy

290
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,160
set the rules of the road rather than

291
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,680
the autocracies

292
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,480
and so we've taken you know a number of

293
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
really significant steps across these

294
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,560
three summits to protect

295
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,160
our uh our health security the global

296
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,800
economy

297
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
our democracies our security and we've

298
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
taken them

299
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,040
together and what we want is for the

300
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,480
people of our countries to

301
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
start to see the benefit of that so you

302
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
know just one example

303
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
the uh g7 nations pledged

304
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,680
a billion doses of vaccine

305
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
of which the us is providing 500 million

306
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,360
and we're not

307
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,120
doing that you know

308
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,440
with any kind of um compellence we're

309
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,959
doing that because it's the right thing

310
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,440
to do

311
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,920
and it's the smart thing to do uh we're

312
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,040
going to work together

313
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,240
in the us and eu context to ensure

314
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,680
that if china invests in our economies

315
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
it's done in a transparent way and it

316
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,160
meets

317
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,279
high labor and environmental standards

318
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,760
and that none of us is getting ripped

319
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,800
off

320
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,160
so these are the kinds of things we're

321
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
trying to do together we agreed on a

322
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,079
15 global corporate tax

323
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,839
to ensure that we don't have an economic

324
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,279
race to the bottom

325
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,399
uh we've got a big fund now to compete

326
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
with china's belt and road and help

327
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
less developed countries on the nato

328
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,519
side we're going to work harder on

329
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
on cyber together and all of these

330
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,560
things so

331
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,639
you know it's been a while since the

332
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,040
united states made concrete investments

333
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
in our alliances and our relationships

334
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,160
with europe

335
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,720
uh but we are we are hopeful that this

336
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
uh very strong week that we have just

337
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,839
had

338
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,120
uh will now convert into a real feeling

339
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,440
of

340
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,240
of unity and greater prosperity and

341
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
security for all of us and uh those

342
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,079
numbers are to shift

343
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,600
thank you we'll check the polls next

344
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,360
year at globsec again

345
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,600
um i will actually go to an audience

346
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,519
question uh from my

347
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,480
colleague at politico sarah wheaton how

348
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
big a problem is very brazen russian

349
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,720
espionage activity in europe and what

350
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,920
can be done about it i noticed she

351
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,079
doesn't ask about the us but

352
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,800
let's focus on europe what do you think

353
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
is the solution

354
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,839
i mean espionage of any kind is is a

355
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,720
problem so

356
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,160
what's most important is that we uh

357
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,519
identify it that we call it out and that

358
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,800
we impose costs

359
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,600
as necessary and i think we've been when

360
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,639
been doing

361
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,200
some of that together we impose costs in

362
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
the u.s for

363
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
solarwinds we've seen the eu

364
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,959
increasingly

365
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,279
take steps and and now we're working on

366
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,760
things like cybercrime and ransomware so

367
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,839
this is an area we have to work on

368
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,160
together

369
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
thank you and in that vein we have

370
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,839
another question from somebody who's

371
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,920
mysteriously initial to wm

372
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,720
uh who wants to know what will the u.s

373
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
russia summit mean to the sino-russian

374
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,519
relationship

375
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,279
of which the russian president putin

376
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,200
described at being at its historical

377
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
peak

378
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,360
what will the u.s russian summit do

379
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,000
for russian chinese relations i think

380
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
that's what kind of symbolism i presume

381
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,959
is what mr

382
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,240
wm meant yeah or how do you think

383
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,600
i think that's you think this will

384
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
affect the sign of a russian

385
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,680
relationship

386
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,199
you know i think that's a question for

387
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,959
russians it's their relationship with

388
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,440
china

389
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,360
i do think that from our perspective

390
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,959
you know the president made clear that

391
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,240
um you know russia should be thinking

392
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,040
hard

393
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,760
about whether it wants to increase its

394
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,279
dependency

395
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,560
on china given china's global

396
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,439
aspirations

397
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,599
thank you

398
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,680
yes we have another question from well

399
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,079
we have two questions about belarus so

400
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,240
uh what was discussed about belarus

401
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,279
yesterday and

402
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,120
and what are the next steps the u.s are

403
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,720
taking i guess maybe we could ask you to

404
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,760
elaborate some of the

405
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,480
the real options uh that the real policy

406
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,920
options that the u.s administration

407
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,320
actually

408
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,240
can take regarding belarus

409
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
at this point belarus is one of those

410
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,920
areas where

411
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
in the context of the summit yesterday

412
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,440
president made

413
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,920
clear that we profoundly disagree with

414
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,600
russia i don't think that

415
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,920
either president disputed that we come

416
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,000
at belarus very differently

417
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,240
um and you know president biden made uh

418
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,680
made absolutely clear that what what

419
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,279
happened with

420
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,000
the uh downing of the aircraft and

421
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,560
pulling

422
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,399
pulling a dissident off the plane and

423
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,360
then later parading him with clear

424
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,279
bruises all over him was just lawless

425
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,800
uh and that we believe that the only way

426
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,680
to respect

427
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,759
the rights and choice of the belarusian

428
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,519
people is to have

429
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,880
a truly free and fair election and

430
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,680
that clearly mr lukashenka is afraid of

431
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,519
of doing that

432
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,000
we have already imposed as has europe a

433
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,199
number of sanctions

434
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,079
and i think you can watch this space

435
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,199
next week for more

436
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,680
thank you very much um i wanted to come

437
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,600
back as we mentioned china

438
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
and one day after nato leaders expressed

439
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
concern about china as a growing

440
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,480
security threat

441
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,800
and two days after the g7 pledged to

442
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,880
work together against china's non-market

443
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,199
economic policies and condemned to china

444
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,560
over human rights abuses

445
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,199
china flew an unprecedented 28 military

446
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,279
planes over taiwan's airspace

447
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,040
uh in one day uh the pentagon

448
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,360
spokesperson john supple doubled down

449
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,800
on america's support to taiwan but did i

450
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,920
want to ask you did the recent

451
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,360
escalation catch you and the state

452
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
department off guard

453
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
how worried should we be about a

454
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
potential miscalculation

455
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,560
that can escalate very quickly into a

456
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,920
situation that nobody wants to be in

457
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,839
yeah i mean china's intimidation of

458
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,040
taiwan has been

459
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,680
increasing steadily over over the recent

460
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,639
period

461
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,759
it's dangerous it's irresponsible we've

462
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,880
been trying to send

463
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,639
pop both public and private messages

464
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
about the dangers here and about our

465
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,199
firm commitment to uh to

466
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,320
taiwan under the taiwan relations act so

467
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,279
you know um this happens sometimes when

468
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,639
you're paying attention

469
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
at leader level to one part of the world

470
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,480
another part of the world

471
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,160
takes takes steps that seek to

472
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,079
to gain attention and not always in

473
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,280
positive ways so

474
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,520
it was uh unfortunate and highly

475
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,839
unwelcome

476
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,679
thank you so much i'm using all the

477
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,439
modern technology with the app and i

478
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,039
just want to do a scan in the room to

479
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,039
see if anybody does have a question that

480
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,200
they haven't submitted electronically

481
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,919
if not we see one we only have uh seven

482
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,120
minutes so i'll ask one question from

483
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,640
the app and then i can ask someone to

484
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,919
come with a microphone

485
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,600
to you um we have one maybe quick

486
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,720
question for you here

487
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
uh with president it's an anonymous

488
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
question with president uh biden's focus

489
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,000
on human rights and the lifting of

490
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,840
sanctions on bensouda etc

491
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,000
are promising signs will the u.s finally

492
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
join the icc

493
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,840
is that possibly in the cards uh

494
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
i don't i don't think so there are a

495
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,120
number of aspects of the icc that we

496
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,600
don't

497
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,960
think are um

498
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,679
produce the best uh judicial results as

499
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,360
you know our position on that is

500
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,320
is well known across both republican and

501
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,440

513
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,480
gender equality it's even stricter than

514
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
the russian one

515
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,960
ursula for london uh published his con

516
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,919
her concerns

517
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,080
uh regarding the law but we haven't

518
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,600
heard anything from the us

519
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,760
do you plan something to do because it's

520
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,080
really it's an urgent matter

521
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,120
thank you thank you well thanks for

522
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,000
raising this i

523
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,520
think um frankly in the

524
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,880
in the helter skelter of of yesterday in

525
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,080
geneva

526
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,799
um i i personally didn't see that this

527
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,320
law had passed as i said

528
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,039
earlier in this conversation

529
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,440
discrimination of any kind

530
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
and particularly on the basis of sexual

531
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
orientation

532
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,919
should have no place in a modern

533
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,240
democracy we have not been shy about

534
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,400
speaking out about these issues anywhere

535
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,679
in the world

536
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,240
including in poland and hungary but

537
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,039
thank you for

538
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,640
calling attention to the fact that this

539
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
new law is passed it takes those

540
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,600
countries in the wrong

541
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
direction and i'm sure we'll be speaking

542
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,840
out from washington

543
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,400
thank you very much um i have another

544
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,360
question so

545
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
we witnessed actually in the last few

546
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,400
days or last week

547
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
uh kind of unprecedented use of

548
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,679
magditzky sanctions

549
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,919
on european union citizens uh in the

550
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,280
case of bulgaria

551
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,799
i'm just wondering i know that you have

552
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,640
a tough anti-corruption stance you've

553
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,320
now told us to watch the space regarding

554
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,440
belarus but is

555
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,120
is this something that we can expect

556
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,799
more of and a lot more of

557
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,640
uh under the new administration

558
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,159
well i think if you if you've paid

559
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,400
attention to what president biden has

560
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,120
been saying

561
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,919
for more than a decade including uh very

562
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,400
strongly when he was vice president

563
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,559
uh he believes that corruption is a

564
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,159
democracy killer

565
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,200
and that it it drains our strength

566
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,320
as democracies and you know sometimes

567
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,000
uh governments have difficulty

568
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,320
uh tackling these issues either they

569
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,080
don't have the law enforcement

570
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,799
strength or their judiciaries are also

571
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,039
infected etc

572
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,120
and so under the global magnitsky

573
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,000
statute which we've now had in the u.s

574
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,559
for

575
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,760
two or three years we can

576
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,919
go after folks who we believe

577
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,360
are abusing the

578
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,000
their positions to rot their countries

579
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,520
from the inside

580
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,960
and or participating corrupt practices

581
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,720
in and around the united states and

582
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,480
that's what you saw in the bulgarian

583
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,440
context

584
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
and interestingly the bulgarian

585
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,000
government was very welcoming of the

586
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,120
action that we took

587
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,679
because some of those actors have been

588
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,799
manipulating

589
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,679
uh the situation politically

590
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:22,640
economically

591
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,559
and corrupting the judicial system for a

592
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,120
very very long time in bulgaria

593
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,640
so i think you'll continue to see us

594
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,039
using global magnitsky sanctions where

595
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,480
they're appropriate both in the

596
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,880
transatlantic space and globally

597
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
thank you very much we have time for one

598
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,679
more question from the audience if there

599
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,480
is one

600
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,000
if not i will go to slido

601
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
um i'll be very curious to see if you

602
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,080
have an answer for this

603
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,280
uh but uh radhu carp is asking about uh

604
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,240
the 16 critical us infrastructures which

605
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,000
are off limits for interference for

606
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,919
cyber attacks uh and he's asking if you

607
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,039
could possibly develop

608
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,559
on this yeah this was a very important

609
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,240
part of the conversation yesterday as

610
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
you know

611
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,559
the u.s has experienced a number of very

612
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,880
serious ransomware attacks colonial

613
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,640
pipeline

614
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,240
one on our meat industry and

615
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,039
uh our information is that these

616
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,280
originate from russian territory so the

617
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,559
president's had

618
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,480
uh quite a serious conversation about

619
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,840
this yesterday

620
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,200
our president wants to see

621
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880
president putin make very clear

622
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,000
that this is unacceptable to his own

623
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,120
people

624
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,760
we he wants to see law enforcement

625
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,480
action

626
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,600
against russian citizens who are

627
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,840
involved in ransomware in the united

628
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,720
states

629
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,240
and they also began a conversation

630
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,840
about these 16

631
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,640
areas that the u.s has identified as

632
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,880
critical infrastructure areas and the

633
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,080
importance

634
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,080
of preventing cyber attacks in these

635
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,720
areas and we've passed that list to the

636
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,320
to the russian government it's also

637
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,799
available on us government websites

638
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,960
it's everything from what you would

639
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
expect it's electricity sector

640
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,520
transport sector food sector health

641
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,559
sector

642
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,600
uh water these kinds of things and

643
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,000
civilized nations should not be

644
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
attacking each other's critical

645
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,120
infrastructure with cyber

646
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,080
or allowing uh criminals from their

647
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,919
territory to do that so

648
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,760
we're gonna initiate and deepen a

649
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,600
dialogue with the russian federation on

650
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,559
these issues and

651
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,600
and test whether they're willing to join

652
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:37,840
us

653
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,600
in preventing this kind of malign

654
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
activity and we'll see as i said that'll

655
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,720
be uh

656
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
a key piece of whether this pudding is

657
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,480
tasty or not

658
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
