would like to know and understand as

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,800
has anyone considering all the news flow

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,760
of this week

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
been able to speak to mr navalny since

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,600
he returned to camp

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,640
how's he doing um and how do you

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,439
think he feels about mr putin not giving

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,520
any guarantees on his life going forward

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
well uh first of all thank you for the

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,960
invitation my

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,520
pleasure to be here and to talk at this

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,920
event

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
we are still able to be in touch with mr

32
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,799
navalny so his

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,240
lawyers are allowed to visit him uh

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
monday to friday and that's our

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,600
connection

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,640
uh there are no bad news about his

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,600
health condition

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,159
and this is good news given all the

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,280
circumstances

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,000
the fact that he's been transferred back

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,399
uh

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,439
to the torture colony to to

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,280
to a panel colony was a very bad

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,640
reputation

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,000
on his birthday on june 4th

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,360
but so far the situation is stable

47
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,799
uh he's not yet aware about the

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,439
press conference uh that the president's

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,680
had after his assignment because

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,639
there is some delay in delivering news

51
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,200
to him but i'm quite sure he will also

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,840
comment on this so we we have a channel

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,480
to get

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,760
feedback from him so he would dictate

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,040
his notes

56
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,720
to his lawyers and they would uh

57
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
publish them on his instagram account

58
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
later so i

59
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
i i believe later this week we'll hear

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,640
something back from him

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
lenin uh you are you have been doing the

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
rounds in dc

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,200
for garnering support um were you at all

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,080
surprised by

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,640
any of the comments from both presidents

66
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,599
uh yesterday

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,879
uh it was not about current support

68
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,840
it was about conveying our message so we

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,239
have

70
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
a message we had a message to deliver

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,599
and we have it

72
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,720
and the uh

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
we also had the feelings that there was

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,760
kind of

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,800
a lack of policy so there is nothing

76
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,760
like a real

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,200
developed policy uh on how to deal with

78
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,560
president putin

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,159
uh and like every things was the

80
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
new wave of operations against political

81
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,319
oppositions in russian chemical weapons

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,120
and so on

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,239
so we became so i came to washington dc

84
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:22,959
kind of to

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,760
offer our perspective about the policy

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,519
and i have a feeling

87
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
that uh many things

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,239
uh of that we were trying to deliver

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,120
well very short so people were eager to

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,840
listen

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
we had many fruitful conversations here

92
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,040
and

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,239
i have a feeling just a feeling that

94
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,080
this also somehow reflected

95
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
also in in in the remarks after the

96
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,959
summit in geneva and in some things that

97
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,280
uh has been also uh delivered to

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
president putin

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
we will know probably better in a few

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,000
days

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
so then we'll have actually more

102
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,080
information about like what happens

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,720
there

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
uh in the meeting room and what will be

105
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,439
the next steps there is the possible

106
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,319
consequences

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,280
our advice was always that president

108
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,080
biden

109
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
should take strong powerful position

110
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,399
on president putin and that there is one

111
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,400
most important

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,680
lesson learned from all the past uh

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
years that there is no such thing as the

114
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,280
recent buttons

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
that unfortunately every time the west

116
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,120
is talking about

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,840
red lines putin is only reaffirmed as

118
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,759
the red lines do not exist

119
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,320
every time the west is trying to find

120
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,479
compromise to build bridges

121
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,360
uh putin is only reassured that he could

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
do whatever he wants

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,759
and he only considers it to be

124
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,000
unfortunately a sign of weakness

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
so and our policy recommendation was

126
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,639
to try something else because like uh

127
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,440
trying to

128
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
push a non-existent reset button

129
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
has been tried for many years without

130
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,759
any success so it would be wise to try

131
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,800
something else

132
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,759
we have a feeling also based on how

133
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,360
angry president putin

134
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,039
was after the meeting and how

135
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,560
dramatically irraganvir has

136
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,400
remarks on mr navalny how many lies he

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,120
produced in a very short period of time

138
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
including assuming that alexander only

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,039
deliberately

140
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,240
left russia to avoid to violate the

141
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,600
conditions

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
of his provisional sentence

143
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,800
after being poisoned it i think shows

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,240
that well putin was kind of

145
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,199
pushed off balance during his meeting

146
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
with president biden

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,320
that he probably had to confront quite a

148
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,080
strong position in quite a strong

149
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,880
argument

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
and that's good news um i'm going to

151
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,639
tell the our audience both online

152
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,039
and right here in the room that you can

153
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,000
put your questions

154
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,880
uh to leonard that you have a multi uh

155
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,919
three ways to do this

156
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,759
in the room if you want to ask a

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,039
question please raise your hand come to

158
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,680

and very quickly answer ask your

160
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,800
question we don't have a lot of time in

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,680
this session

162
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,080
um you can also do it online via the

163
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,440
globex app and

164
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,800
of course you can do it while i zoom

165
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,720
through the virtual studio so just to

166
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
leave that with you

167
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,479
we have a question in from our audience

168
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,960
which makes uh my life quite simple

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
leona because i was going to go there

170
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,759
the parallels with roman petrosevic and

171
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,440
his arrest and

172
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,080
the ability of the russians to parade

173
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,520
him in front of the media

174
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,720
um i know mr navalny um dedicated his

175
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,520
recent

176
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,880
award to people in political prisoners

177
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,000
in both belarussia and

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,199
in um in russia ilya is asking

179
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,120
what would your advice be to better

180
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,800
russians at this point

181
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
um as they take on the question of

182
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,599
what's going on in their country

183
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,160
uh sorry no advice the countries are

184
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
different political situations are

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,720
different

186
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,520
and every like historical and political

187
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,639
parallel could be

188
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
dangerous i i very much believe that

189
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,160
fellow russians

190
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,800
much better know what to do and how to

191
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
deal with their situation we

192
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,639
of course follow the situation with a

193
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,120
lot of compassion and respect and

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,599
i mean we are both now really like

195
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,199
brother faults like this is this like

196
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,080
being

197
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
uh endangered by crazy dictators

198
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,520
but still i prefer kind of not to give

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,960
any advice that could

200
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,039
i mean lead to also negative

201
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,319
consequences because

202
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,039
i don't feel the political situation and

203
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:49,919
belarus

204
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,520
uh so good as uh leaders of the russian

205
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,080
position uh feel it and it's important

206
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
so i've been asked many times like okay

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
you're based in vilnius now why don't

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,160
you like meet and talk with us with

209
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,360
sri lanka and that people and

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,479
i very intentionally do not do this

211
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,319
uh because well otherwise of course we

212
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,080
could spend many hours

213
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,720
having nice and pleasant conversations

214
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,120
but

215
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,520
i believe that those conversations will

216
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,400
not help

217
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,800
uh either people of belarus or people of

218
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,680
russia so

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,639
let us concentrate on fighting putin let

220
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,199
them concentrate on fighting fighting

221
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,120
and of course we will follow what's

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,320
going on and try

223
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
well and try to learn from each other

224
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
the one common factor with with both

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,159
oppositions is that both are young

226
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,039
that's where

227
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,519
uh you you find your support within the

228
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,399
youth in

229
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,959
in russia you've had to shut down your

230
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,959
officers uh you've said that many of

231
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,080
these officers which have been turned

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,680
into independent regional political

233
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
organizations are not going to survive

234
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,120
you've seen people like miss sobol

235
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
having to withdraw from the

236
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
parliamentary elections because of being

237
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,839
labeled extremists you've had to move

238
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,519
like you said to vilnius

239
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,800
as have other people within that space

240
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,480
in the last month and a half how much

241
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,800
of passion is still there within those

242
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,480
young people to keep fighting poop

243
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,200
you know mr putin or keep opposing his

244
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,080
policies

245
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
have you seen any decrees have is there

246
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
nervousness in that or in that entire

247
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,560
group

248
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,000
that age group because they're on social

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
media that's one of the common factors

250
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,839
isn't it

251
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,959
no i didn't see any decrease

252
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,160
uh contrary to that i mean

253
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,240
uh all the fundamental factors for the

254
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
protests in russia

255
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
are not gone and will not be gone so

256
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,120
even if mr putin would bulldoze away

257
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,519
all the physical buildings where our

258
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
regional offices used to be

259
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
this will not this wouldn't help him to

260
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,480
do anything with the poverty corruption

261
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,720
or injustice of the political system

262
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,519
so putin is trying to

263
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,880
uh kind of to to push uh the protest

264
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,040
like under the carpet so to to

265
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,079
to make it less visible like this

266
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,360
um when we now are not any more able to

267
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
continue

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,079
our offline operations in russia as we

269
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,440
used to be as

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
hundreds thousands of people are being

271
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,680
disenfranchised from participation

272
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
in elections when you are not allowed to

273
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,240
be to appear on the ballot

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,959
even running for the village council not

275
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,480
only for the state domain

276
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,000
of course this very much affects

277
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
well the visible um

278
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,320
uh things with the of the

279
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
the visible artifacts for the political

280
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,600
life but it

281
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,880
can't change the attitude fundamentally

282
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,959
well this actually only makes people a

283
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,640
little bit more angry

284
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,760
that they cannot express their

285
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,279
political views assessments

286
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
uh using like legal and public tools

287
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,880
they are not allowed to to campaign for

288
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,079
their candidates

289
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,839
since they are not allowed to donate

290
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,000
money to the organizations they

291
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,959
support and so on so on so the

292
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,399
fundamental factors

293
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,800
are not gone until not begun there is

294
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,600
nothing

295
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,279
putin could do against injustice

296
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
corruption or poverty

297
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,399
and people are getting angrier so of

298
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,200
course

299
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
this doesn't you know to decrease

300
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
country uh

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
it's actually an increase in

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,800
uh descent in our country only that it

303
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,920
is becoming less

304
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,640
visible and it is it is of course

305
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,360
creating

306
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
a quite dangerous situation so a

307
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,040
situation when

308
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,240
like anything could become a

309
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,440
spark that would kind of ignite the

310
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,200
situation

311
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,079
do you find it worrying that these laws

312
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,399
and

313
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,360
all the surveillance um is becoming part

314
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,680
of

315
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,720
a arsenal of weapons being used by

316
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,440
um leaders like president putin for

317
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
suppressing free expression

318
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,079
independent media how how in your

319
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,040
opinion from

320
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,480
your perspective from the russian

321
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,800
perspective do you reverse a trend like

322
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,760
that when

323
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,920
young people are obviously looking to

324
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
voice themselves

325
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,800
but are skirting very dangerously close

326
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,160
to breaking laws in place

327
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,320
uh well first of all you're right i mean

328
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
uh like we are having conferences to

329
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,240
discuss

330
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,200
good practices and you know to to

331
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,760
discuss

332
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,959
how how to better reduce this or that

333
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,480
but it looks like putting lukashenka

334
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,120
maduro and and the likes of them are

335
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,959
probably also having their conferences

336
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,000
you know like

337
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
sharing the best the worst practices

338
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,639
discussing how to

339
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,320
uh be a better dictator how to

340
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,279
to close more how to produce more evil

341
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,720
things and so on

342
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,600
so they're learning from each other and

343
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,279
very fast

344
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,360
actually very many things that happened

345
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,560
in belarus

346
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,959
uh happened in russia and in just half a

347
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,760
year

348
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,160
and the things putting very clearly

349
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,560
learned like inherited from lukashank

350
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
and also some things are going in a

351
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
backward direction of course

352
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
unfortunately

353
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,800
and yes it results in a dramatic

354
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,040
deterioration of the political situation

355
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,639
now both countries

356
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,279
and what's happening in russia is is of

357
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,760
course

358
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,199
terrible when people are being

359
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,240
persecuted for very legal

360
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,240
forms of participation in political

361
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,279
activities

362
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,680
for participation and peaceful rallies

363
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,160
for an attempt to register a political

364
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,880
party

365
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,199
for an attempt just to be on the ballot

366
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,279
we have filed papers for

367
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,000
registration of our political party nine

368
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,639
times

369
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,040
and we were nine times rejected and now

370
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,320
we are labeled an

371
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,839
extremist organization being not allowed

372
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,279
to exercise any

373
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,560
legal form of public political activity

374
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
in the country

375
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,800
is it good no of course it's not bad uh

376
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,199
it's of course it's very bad does it

377
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,480
anyhow

378
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,800
um string pass of of our optimism about

379
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,839
russian future

380
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,519
no not really well the clock

381
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,320
is very clearly taken in our favor you

382
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,720
were

383
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
already talking speaking about like

384
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,760
young people

385
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,320
they see that well navalny's support

386
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,120
among

387
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,560
voters under 30 is

388
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,040
larger than putin support so he is doing

389
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,160
just better

390
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,199
in the polls even being in prison

391
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,920
not on the ballot not being able to

392
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
campaign

393
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,800
this situation is not going to change so

394
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,639
people are very tired of putting his

395
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,320
there for like 20 something

396
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,600
years every new re-election even

397
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
despite the fact that a position is not

398
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
allowed to participate

399
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,360
every new re-election becomes more and

400
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,480
more of stress

401
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
for him and also that's that that's

402
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,760
something that we've seen

403
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,800
in belarus also that lukashenko

404
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,320
after 25 years in power got into

405
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,600
huge problem trying to get uh

406
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,720
re-elected even with just even with his

407
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,160
like fully cleaned surreal uh political

408
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,959
system

409
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,680
and uh his system of electoral

410
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,639
commission and so on

411
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,240
this will happen this will happen in

412
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,680
russia also so

413
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,880
this dictatorship is cruel

414
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,759
but if it is not capable to over survive

415
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,040
mr putin

416
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,720
and the next generation of

417
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,839
politicians as it will arrive will

418
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,639
will be able to contribute for like

419
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,399
democratic and peaceful transition

420
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,720
in the country just because putin's rule

421
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,199
is based on his personal tyson relations

422
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,279
and of course on negative selection so

423
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,959
he doesn't have anyone

424
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,680
uh in in our generation who could be

425
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,759
like competitive

426
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,120
we have a question in the room if you

427
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,720

428
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,040
and

429
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,000

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,639

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,800
i would very much like to hear your

436
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
opinion on whether the character

437
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,959
of russian politics in the last couple

438
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,560
of decades and well

439
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,839
specifically uh putin's uh authoritative

440
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,040
authoritarian

441
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,800
so to say presidential figure could have

442
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,160
influenced the

443
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
opinions on democracy in central and

444
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,920
eastern europe

445
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
lately the opinion poll we might have

446
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,279
seen on

447
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,360
the previous panel in mary authorisia

448
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,680
for those of you who attended

449
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,079
then it does is that what do you think

450
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,240
of that has his politics has the way

451
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,480
he's approached his uh

452
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,880
his rule in uh russia influenced the cee

453
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,240
well as we see that putin learns a lot

454
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,799
from lukashenko of course many other

455
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,919
dictators or wannabe dictators try to

456
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,319
learn

457
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,359
something from putin because many

458
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,240
uh consider has like political model to

459
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,039
be quite

460
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:29,120
attractive this is

461
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,919
and putin also does a lot for expert of

462
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,960
corruption

463
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,520
to europe it's a very natural thing like

464
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
russia exports

465
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
enormous amounts of money of assets

466
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
being stolen from russian taxpayer

467
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,480
taxpayers to european countries and

468
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
along with this money a lot of

469
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,679
corruption arrives

470
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
like when a russian deputy minister

471
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
uh would buy themselves a villa

472
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,480
in cote d'azur they would also very much

473
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,160
consider like uh

474
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,720
corrupting local judge local municipal

475
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,840
official

476
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,559
local mayor local police because first

477
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,360
of all

478
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,760
this is their motorcycle randy they used

479
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,200
to operate this way

480
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,039
back in russia and they of course want

481
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,559
to continue this

482
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,520
style of operations also and second

483
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,120
because well they don't want

484
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,200
questions to be asked about source of

485
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
their fonts and

486
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,440
and so on so on and putin also

487
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,360
uses expert of corruption as a very

488
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,440
natural tool for him

489
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,840
to to buy influence to rot

490
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,919
the foundations of european political

491
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,200
system to get

492
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,280
like engage these different european

493
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,120
politicians and to see it

494
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,480
here and there more and more uh european

495
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
politicians specifically far

496
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,679
right and far left putin doesn't care

497
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,000
of their political affiliation it's just

498
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,120
important for him

499
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,960
that they would contribute to the

500
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,200
turbulence in european political systems

501
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,600
so

502
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
more and more far-right and far-left

503
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,640
politicians

504
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,080
are quite openly acting as putin's

505
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,600
agents as his likely really

506
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,720
like being really really like celebrate

507
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,919
employees of kremlin and and this is

508
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:14,480
becoming

509
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,840
dangerous and of course like many

510
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,440
political leaders in central eastern

511
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,240
europe

512
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,600
first of all see putin as a possible

513
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,559
source of funds for their political work

514
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,160
and second as a kind of

515
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,480
like inspirational model look like the

516
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,640
guy managed to

517
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,600
stay in power for 20 plus years and

518
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,559
squeeze

519
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,559
enormous assets from the economy

520
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,360
uh putin is a better role model and this

521
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,440
is one more reason why he's

522
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,160
dangerous nina that brings up an

523
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,679
interesting point that if it's so

524
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,720
ingrained maria asks is it possible then

525
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
to see russia

526
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,520
become more democratic and liberal in

527
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,120
the near future

528
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,919
or will this ongoing regime just extend

529
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,919
until

530
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,159
2036 i think that's

531
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,080
a question to ask especially considering

532
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,760
the position mr navalny is in

533
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,440
and what you were talking about

534
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
uh we didn't know when the transition

535
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,360
will happen

536
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,919
we are sure the putinism will not be

537
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,360
able to

538
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,000
over survive mr putin because it's a

539
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,799
very

540
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,760
personalistic regime everything is very

541
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,080
much

542
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,120
built on personal ties that mr putin has

543
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,760
with

544
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,960
this existence this is that guy but

545
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,480
uh didn't know when the change

546
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,440
will come putin will not be gone because

547
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,679
of

548
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,919
an election it could happen for

549
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,280
biological reasons

550
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,000
it can happen because of some black swan

551
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,480
type

552
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,799
event like when something like random

553
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:51,520
happens

554
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,159
like the arab spring started in march

555
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,600
2011

556
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,559
or it could be like a severe elite split

557
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,960
uh when the political elite will

558
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,360
realize that kind of the

559
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,159
downsides of keeping putin as their

560
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,600
supreme arbiter

561
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,480
uh become to start to become more

562
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,440
important

563
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,840
than the upsides of it each of these

564
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,679
three scenarios is possible

565
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,039
but we can't really make a prediction

566
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,200
when this will happen we know what

567
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,320
should we do

568
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,600
when each of these three scenarios

569
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,679
when either of these three scenarios

570
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,280
comes true we have to be

571
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,440
the largest and the best organized

572
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,480
political

573
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,440
force in the country that will stand up

574
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:37,840
and

575
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,679
demand for a democratic peaceful

576
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,760
transition and will be perfectly

577
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,679
capable to do so

578
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,159
does anyone have a question in the room

579
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:48,880
because then

580
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,720
i will go to my final question oh yes

581
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,960
please

582
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
just a very quick question i see i see

583
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,840
that you are restricted

584
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,159
and your organization is actually not

585
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,400
having the access to the proper media

586
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,039
because it's controversial sorry zoltan

587
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,039
virgo from hungary so we have

588
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,559
similar experiences with hungary what

589
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,400
you have actually in russia

590
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
so how do you reach out to the normal

591
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,720
people to the waters

592
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
so how the messages from your

593
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,320
organization is passed actually to the

594
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,679
waters because

595
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,840
otherwise you control or you have the

596
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,360
young generation behind you but the

597
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,520
waters are a little bit older so how you

598
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
communicate with the general public

599
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,360
thank you uh well first of all we do not

600
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,120
distinguish young people from

601
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,760
general public young people are general

602
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,640
public

603
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,200
uh the internet penetration rate in

604
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,840
russia

605
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,120
is well over 70 percent so it's

606
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,159
kind of a stereotype of course that only

607
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:48,960
young people

608
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,679
are there uh the internet penetration

609
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:52,400
rate is

610
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,760
like 100 among young people over

611
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,039
80 percent in people under 55

612
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,080
and over 60 percent and people

613
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,360
aged 55 plus so we are

614
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,480
perfectly able to be in touch with

615
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,039
all generations through social media but

616
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:11,840
of course

617
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,679
we also kind of ask young quarters

618
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,880
to be part of our media we very actively

619
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,080
engage them

620
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,919
into bringing our message through

621
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,039
to their like parents

622
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,400
owns uh elder relatives and so on

623
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,360
because

624
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,919
not because uh their parents don't have

625
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,200
access to the internet

626
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,679
but because we believe that the personal

627
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,559
message

628
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,480
uh brought through a devoted supporter

629
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,679
is much stronger than any

630
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,200
uh media coverage and any

631
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,440
other way to deliver the message

632
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,600
that would bring me to one of my final

633
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,360
questions or my final question because

634
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,799
we are running out of time

635
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,559
how do you make that democratic

636
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,880
transition at a point when it is so

637
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,559
difficult for young people

638
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,480
and convince them to stay in the fight

639
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,159
despite the consequences that

640
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,320
might be waiting for them whether it's

641
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,159
prison labor camps

642
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,279
or any other consequences

643
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,919
so we don't have to ask anyone to stay

644
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,480
in the fight

645
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,440
once again i i think it's very important

646
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:23,919
people

647
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,960
within the country have their feeling

648
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,600
their feelings their perception that the

649
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
situation is very bad

650
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,360
the situation is very unfair people

651
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,720
perfectly know

652
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,679
that they have been that all their like

653
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,080
democratic rights and human rights

654
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,400
have been taken away from that we don't

655
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,640
need to explain it to people people

656
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,720
know that they work perfectly so and

657
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,279
people also are aware of the fact that

658
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:51,919
well

659
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,520
many uh tools

660
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,320
of like political engagement that have

661
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,640
been

662
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,360
available for them are not available

663
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,240
anymore

664
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,440
that they would face severe risk when

665
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,480
uh risks when trying to engage

666
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,960
uh political in the ways they used to be

667
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,640
in the ways it was legal but

668
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,360
is not any more legal but this doesn't

669
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,240
ex

670
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,520
affect putin's perception so the fact

671
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,960
that putin like

672
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,919
uh declares us an extremist organization

673
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,880
doesn't make him

674
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,600
more popular among people doesn't win

675
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,720
him supporters

676
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,279
doesn't convert our supporters to

677
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:31,760
putting

678
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,240
supporters quite contrary even more

679
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,159
people think that something very

680
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,200
unfair uh is happening

681
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,919
that's it that brings me very nicely to

682
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,640
our poll

683
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,559
leonid and this was a poll that we ran

684
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,919
when this conversation

685
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,559
started the question is is vladimir

686
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,799
putin mostly perceived positively or

687
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,159
