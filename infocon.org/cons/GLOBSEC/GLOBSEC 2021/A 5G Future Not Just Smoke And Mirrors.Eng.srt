businesses and citizens have timely

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,680
access to 5g governance is very

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,399
essential

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,720

pandemic hash showed us the importance

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,640
of her silence and high-speed

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,920
communication

operations and of course also different

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,280
processes

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,920
5g is also one of the one of the seven

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,560
flagships areas of recovery funds

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,240
a significant share of its target 150

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,840
billion euros

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,400
on digital budget should finance you

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,880
network

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
infrastructures as well in the future a

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
fast connectivity has a large

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,799
impact on economic and innovation and

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,079
social well-being

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,040
but is a proper 5g network connection

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,920
and coverage

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,119
only enough for the eu to be competitive

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,000
in a region

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,240
in the world so this is exactly what we

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,000

klopsec app which is working

106
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,440
over the and and then the last option of

107

course is to connect over

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,120
zoom uh to the virtual studio as well so

uh you get to ask about file to your

113
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
future from such experts that we have

114
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
together with me here today

115
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,720
okay um so starting with the very first

116
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,519
question the gig

117
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,159
of our panel discussion here so i do

118
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,599
have a question that is

119
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,200
mostly addressed now uh to olive firstly

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,799
so what are the necessary and urgent

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,238
next steps to build

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,199
out nationwide full of iot network in

123
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
europe

124
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,120
thank you annette and i'm sorry not to

125
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,040
be able to join you in in

126
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,080
beautiful bratislava so i mean first let

127
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,560
me just

128
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,639
emphasize that europe really needs high

129
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,919
performing full

130
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,560
g full 5g networks now to stay

131
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
competitive because as we see

132
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,199
leading regions in asia and north

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,080
america or

134
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
as we speak uh deploying nationwide

135
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
uh 5g use using mid band spectrum

136
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,560
providing gigabit speeds to users

137
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,840
and and creating a very high performance

138
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,160
of

139
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,199
the network everywhere across country

140
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,360
and we saw that also in the the latest

141
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
ericsson mobility report that we

142
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,280
published earlier this week that

143
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,440
europe is falling behind i mean

144
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
northeast asia is leading

145
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,720
ahead of north america and also the gcc

146
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
countries in the middle east

147
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,000
ahead of europe when it comes to 5g

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,360
rollout

149
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,360
and high performing 5g full 5g networks

150
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,479
i should say

151
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,880
they must be seen as a critical digital

152
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,320
infrastructure

153
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,560
they are a cornerstone of our society

154
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,160
and and our economy and they will

155
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,960
support the economic and social recovery

156
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,000
also from from kovit and high

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,800
performance

158
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
full 5g uh coverage is enabled of a

159
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,120
mid-band spectrum and is required to

160
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,919
enable

161
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
new advanced use cases because we also

162
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,600
have to recognize that

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
the so the first phase of 5g will mean

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,199
enhanced

165
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,520
mobile broadband is sort of a 4g on

166
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,880
steroids if you like

167
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,560
but when we move to full 5g uh based on

168
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,039
what we call standalone 5g architecture

169
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,319
that will really

170
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
uh make a revolutionary change

171
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
uh since it will offer low latency fast

172
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,000
response times

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,720
and enabling automation and

174
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,000
virtualization and network slicing

175
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,039
capabilities

176
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,120
so so we really need to move to that

177
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,160
stage uh

178
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,280
soon in europe as well thank you

179
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,280
and i would also address this question

180
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
to beers you are telling us

181
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,919
impossibles am i correct you have any

182
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,039
comments on what

183
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,080
uh ulf was saying

184
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,479
well good morning annette uh good

185
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,000
morning to all i am very sorry that i'm

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,800
not with you

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
uh in bratislava but thank you for the

188
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,440
invitation

189
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,880
it is the case that we see

190
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,720
global competitors in other regions of

191
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,400
the world

192
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,919
making great advances we do have some

193
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:48,880
good cases

194
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,840
in the european union with countries

195
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,479
that are

196
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,880
reaching even 80 percent coverage even

197
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,639
before we come to what will refer to as

198
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:56,880
the

199
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,240
the standalone 5g so

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
5g role has been progressing very well

201
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,400
in some areas

202
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,319
but of course not still providing the

203
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,560
true dynamic

204
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,400
ultra high speed low latency networks

205
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,919
that we need

206
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,720
we do have you know a target a set of

207
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,479
targets in europe

208
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,360
and they have for the rollout of 5g

209
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,199
depended to a large extent on

210
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,560
spectrum deployment the licensing of

211
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,599
spectrum

212
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
and while we did have success in

213
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
identifying

214
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,360
the three pioneer bands for radio

215
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,319
spectrum

216
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,560
that gave us also a sense of purpose and

217
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,120
it allowed for some coordination

218
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,680
it's not just enough with the first wave

219
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,919
of licensing to have coverage what we

220
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,720
need is

221
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,680
the mid-band spectrum to be available

222
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,039
and operational

223
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,960
for those applications which i've just

224
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,280
mentioned but which are very critical

225
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,000
because they will create the demand for

226
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,479
5g

227
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,960
services particularly from business

228
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,680
users

229
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,599
from the vertical sectors who will use

230
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,800
this high speed

231
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
reliable ultra secure network capacity

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,360
for all of their operations and services

233
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,440
so for business to business services

234
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
but also for internal organization and

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,520
for the digitalization

236
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,080
of all aspects of the value chain and

237
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,240
that is really what 5g is about it is

238
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,599
that shift

239
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,800
which we still have to

240
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,280
mainstream in europe in order for people

241
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,240
to understand

242
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,400
that this is critical for our

243
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,599
competitiveness

244
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,240
it's critical actually for our economic

245
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
recovery

246
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,080
from the covet crisis and it will

247
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,799
provide

248
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,240
a basis for innovation for productivity

249
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,200
and of course uh for competitiveness as

250
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,560
i've said for all sectors

251
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,760
of of the industry now uh we can come

252
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,040
back to the questions

253
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,440
of comparing ourselves to other regions

254
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
but the fact is that

255
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
europe's future is in its hands and we

256
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
now need to seize the opportunity

257
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
of 5g which is ready to be deployed

258
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,279
thank you for your opening remarks as

259
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
well here for the first question i would

260
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
now turn all the way to mihil

261
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
i do not know which city you're joining

262
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,880
us at the moment

263
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
but i also have a question for you we

264
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,240
know that

265
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,800
the european uh commission has deployed

266
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
a fight action plan

267
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,360
can we say that the implementation of

268
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,399
five teach strategy

269
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,040
has been successful so far and what has

270
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
been the biggest challenges in the

271
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,279
process

272
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,320
so thank you very much annette and uh

273
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,880
hello

274
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,920
everybody and and again sorry not to be

275
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,720
here uh

276
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,760
with you in in bratislava so um

277
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,160
and thank you also for giving me the the

278
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,440
opportunity

279
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,480
to explain the role of barrick as

280
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,600
a facilitator in the in the process i

281
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320
i i think that uh it's it's totally

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
clear for us

283
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
that we have made promoting the full

284
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,440
connectivity as one of our

285
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,240
key priorities for the five uh coming

286
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,040
years and

287
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,480
this means that we prioritize the work

288
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,839
that improves general

289
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,120
conditions for the the expansion and

290
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,600
the take-up of secure reliable and

291
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,959
competitive

292
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,079
networks in the

293
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
very high capacity networks both fixed

294
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,760
and mobile while entering the transition

295
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,160
from

296
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,440
a legacy infrastructure so we just

297
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,959
don't only focus on the 5g coverage

298
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,079
emf issues but also less visible

299
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,040
aspects such as uh backhoe and and the

300
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
copper uh switch off

301
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,040
and of course um when you look at the

302
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,560
digital agenda there is

303
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,240
a lot of european instruments

304
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
need to need to be implemented and yes

305
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,920
so far it's not totally the case the

306
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
first one is

307
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
is of course the the timely

308
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,560
implementation of the

309
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,279
european electronic communications codes

310
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,120
you you know that

311
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,560
24 countries i received an ins

312
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,240
friesement letter from from the

313
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
commission a few a few

314
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
weeks ago in addition to that you need

315
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,760
to to implement

316
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,040
the barrack guidelines in helping

317
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,839
a a consistent and harmonized

318
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,680
implementation of the cause

319
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,120
beric has adopted a dozen of um

320
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,440
guidelines uh so far there is a

321
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,279
connectivity toolbox

322
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,240
to ensure a timely in investment

323
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,839
friendly access to 5g

324
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
uh spectrum please just refer to to the

325
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
need to get access to

326
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,160
a 5g spectrum as soon as possible

327
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,600
there is also an instrument to um

328
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,839
reduce the costs the administrative

329
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,240
costs and civil engineering costs

330
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,880
um so the the review of the broadened

331
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,600
cost

332
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
reduction is still underway and it will

333
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,399
really help the implementation of this

334
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,200
agenda

335
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,399
more specifically on 5g there is a

336
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,440
roadmap and when we look at this roadmap

337
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,920
we come to the conclusion there are many

338
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,200
aspects to be

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
taken into consideration some of them

340
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
i've just mentioned but also

341
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
coverage indicates uh international

342
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,040
plumbing

343
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,680
and that's what we are working on within

344
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,079
uh

345
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,440
barrack we have a dedicated workflow on

346
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,399
5g

347
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,639
cyber security for the the

348
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,680
implementation of

349
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,040
5g toolbox there will be a report on on

350
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
backhaul which is

351
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
important as well we just had two weeks

352
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,600
ago a

353
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,160
workshop on the impact of 5g on

354
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,120
regulations

355
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,440
with stakeholders like uh

356
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
representatives of verticals

357
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,800
we will have other workshops on coverage

358
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,399
and and and indicators

359
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,360
and also you i i have just finally to

360
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,279
mention that we developed last year

361
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,399
a raider 5g right there which describes

362
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,000
in details the next steps

363
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,200
we need to uh undertake to

364
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
for for the coming years so yes

365
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,360
the digital agenda is is not

366
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
totally uh a reality and we still need

367
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,440
to push her at

368
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,720
uh for for 5g over to you and it

369
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
yeah thank you uh when we when we talk

370
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
about like different countries how far

371
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,440
they are currently with the

372
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,079
implementation

373
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,000
process inside of the european union i

374
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,079
would say we see drastic changes

375
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,639
drastical like differences as well and

376
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,639
and in time it has changed a lot

377
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,120
uh how could the european union and push

378
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,040
and help the member states with this

379
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,000
development process

380
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
and past possible ways and you to speed

381
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,959
up the process of development in

382
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,880
different countries so i would turn this

383
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,240
question uh first to

384
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,120
peers and and then maybe you can also

385
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,519
add something from your site

386
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,120
certainly yes thank you because that is

387
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,279
very important we're not just taking a

388
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,120
punitive view to whether or not member

389
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,959
states have implemented regulation

390
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,240
it's actually the work that we've been

391
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,920
doing for over five years with the

392
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,800
industry

393
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,320
including with the 5g industry

394
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
association which has been the focus of

395
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,160
our research and innovation work

396
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,360
and that is really helping for their the

397
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,079
the development of the 5g technologies

398
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,040
but now

399
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,360
helping with the deployment to overcome

400
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,399
bottlenecks

401
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,360
but also simply to provide some of the

402
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,279
uh the funding that might be required to

403
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,519
ensure that it is rolled out across

404
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,399
uh the european union more importantly

405
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,760
and this goes back to what i was saying

406
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,680
earlier but we do believe that the real

407
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,800
driver

408
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
for 5g uptake the full 5g will be the

409
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,920
business use cases the verticals who

410
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,680
will be able to apply

411
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,880
5g technologies to improving all aspects

412
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
of their operations

413
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,399
uh become more innovative and also to

414
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,760
drive down cost

415
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
so those new business ecosystems are

416
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,959
essential we have

417
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,079
several major uh pilots across several

418
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,120
countries

419
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,079
uh funded already in order to show the

420
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,320
user groups in key sectors

421
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,199
like transport and mobility like health

422
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,160
even in agri-food for example

423
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,800
as to the full scope of applications of

424
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,839
5g

425
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,079
and now to answer your question it is of

426
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,680
course the next step how do we

427
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,199
globalize this how do we make sure that

428
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,360
it happens everywhere we are working

429
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,760
with

430
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,120
an alliance of operators in the alliance

431
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,399
on cloud and edge

432
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
to ensure that the next generation of

433
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,600
technologies is

434
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,959
fully incorporated into 5g because

435
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,120
we will increasingly be seeing cloud

436
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,079
computing

437
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,399
as something that is sitting beside the

438
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,560
5g networks out at the edge of those

439
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
networks and that's essential

440
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,600
for europe we're also looking simply at

441
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,720
funding in the recovery and resilience

442
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,279
funds

443
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,440
that the european council agreed and

444
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,199
which is now in place

445
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,720
the member states in a number of

446
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,560
countries have included

447
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,759
5g elements deployment elements in their

448
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
national recovery plans that will go

449
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,440
work together with investment funding

450
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,680
from eu invest that is available for

451
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,759
large-scale infrastructure projects

452
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,759
and we're also of course thinking of the

453
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,519
cross-border elements and we have the

454
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,199
connected european facility

455
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,959
in which we will ensure that major

456
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,040
transport paths that cross

457
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,759
european borders are actually fully

458
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:18,399
equipped

459
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,600
with 5g standalone 5g in order to

460
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,639
support

461
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,680
all of the logistics and transport

462
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,720
necessary for the smooth running of the

463
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,480
european internal market

464
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
so that's a lot of different activities

465
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,759
where

466
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,680
you you asked michelle about the 5g

467
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,800
action plan

468
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
we will together be able to meet our

469
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,560
objectives we have the commercial

470
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,519
rollout

471
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,720
of 5g in

472
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
in all countries but now we must ensure

473
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
that we meet our next targets

474
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,279
which is to ensure coverage of all of

475
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,720
the population

476
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
as well as developing these business

477
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
cases so i won't go into any more detail

478
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,079
but we already have more than

479
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,639
30 private 5g networks established in

480
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,480
around 10 member states

481
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
with eu funding which are serving the

482
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,799
purpose of piloting 5g services

483
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,599
in different sectors and business

484
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,400
sectors

485
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
and it shows that there's a pent-up

486
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,679
demand there

487
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,599
businesses eager to start testing and

488
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,199
using 5g services

489
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,280
so the member states have to get that

490
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,319
spectrum

491
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,359
available and licensed to operators

492
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,439
so that we can actually benefit from 5g

493
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,120
thank you for the overview and and now i

494
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,799
would turn to you well if

495
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,880
but but also i would add a question here

496
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,400
um you've been working together with

497
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,240
many different member states and and how

498
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,280
do you see

499
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,760
why is the attitude towards 5g

500
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
implementation so different in member

501
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,320
states

502
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,280
how has your experience been with that

503
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,080
yeah

504
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,919
thanks for that annette and first let me

505
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,679
just uh echo what

506
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,320
what what peers said here that that uh

507
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,000
there are significant

508
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
values and benefits attached to to

509
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,640
to uh connecting industries and

510
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,520
agriculture

511
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,799
uh uh we we worked with analysis mason

512
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,520
to make uh

513
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,960
uh uh sort of an economic review of the

514
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,840
benefits

515
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,320
of uh 5g for for for businesses

516
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,240
and we saw that the benefits uh were uh

517
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,559
the highest benefits were when it comes

518
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,400
to smart manufacturing and actually

519
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,039
smart

520
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,840
agriculture uh we saw that the the

521
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,799
sort of uh cost-benefit ratio of

522
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,400
investments were six times

523
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,360
uh with with the 40 plus billion of

524
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,400
investments you can

525
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,520
you can see a potential of more than 250

526
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,840
billion

527
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,919
euros so so i think uh there are some

528
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,360
really good examples here

529
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,039
uh but at the definitely smart factories

530
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,679
smart agriculture uh including fixed

531
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,720
wireless access based on 5g

532
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,640
will be the main beneficiaries when it

533
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,080
comes to to uh

534
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,919
to uh to to 5g in the business sector

535
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,919
but we should also remember that there

536
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,360
will be environmental

537
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,600
uh benefits because 5g is also green and

538
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,000
it very

539
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,760
much supports not only

540
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,679
the digital transformation of europe but

541
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,799
also

542
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,240
the green transformation and we see that

543
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,480
the benefits flowing there are will be

544
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
definitely when it comes to smart

545
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,919
factories but also in agriculture in

546
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:26,880
construction

547
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
and of course uh smart automotive

548
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,679
and if you see which which uh

549
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,919
countries are setting good examples uh

550
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,679
and yes coming back to the issue of

551
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,520
coverage and and

552
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,400
as as pierce mentioned earlier there are

553
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
some countries that have reached a very

554
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
high 5g uh broad coverage

555
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,679
geographical coverage and that means

556
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,440
that you offer this innovation this

557
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,080
fantastic

558
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
innovation platform for all of your

559
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,000
certified all of your businesses is not

560
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
selected just in

561
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,640
the main cities or in in some areas

562
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,520
and that i think is the most most

563
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,960
important and that is also

564
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,200
coming back to the spectrum issue making

565
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,000
mid band

566
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,360
spectrum available but also uh in

567
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,400
investment friendly conditions

568
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,640
and i'm sure also the pilots that pierce

569
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
mentioned can can play a vital role here

570
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,280
and once again coming back to the rrf i

571
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,559
mean recovery

572
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,080
resilience funds i think the the

573
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,720
all the 27 uh governments of the eu

574
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,760
should should

575
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,600
really ensure to make the best possible

576
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,919
use of these and also to speeding up

577
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,919
uh 5g all right thanks for the year with

578
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,280
you as well from your side

579
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,600
um our audience is actually pretty

580
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
active today so we have received already

581
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,320
a couple of questions sam so i will also

582
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,600
address them as well here

583
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,400
tyson parker has asked here how can

584
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,360
europe ensure

585
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,799
that age of computing and open air a n

586
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,480
infrastructure are not eventually

587
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,720
dominated by us-based hipper scalers

588
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,840
maybe miho you would like to answer that

589
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,080
one here

590
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,360
yes thank you very much and it's

591
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,960
so i think that europe is

592
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,480
already investigating this type of model

593
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,039
but as

594
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,919
as you can probably see also in the 5g

595
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,200
observatory it's

596
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,320
to be considered as not a major yet so

597
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:26,960
some

598
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,400
different companies have also invested

599
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
to see to which extent open rent could

600
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,679
uh

601
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,960
offer a solution and i think that um

602
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,240
ulf is very well placed to to to tell

603
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,200
some more about that and this is

604
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
definitely something

605
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,880
we will go through with the national

606
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,720
regulators in the coming

607
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,320
years but uh for for the time uh

608
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,400
being it is not uh or our priority will

609
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,159
we will i would say stick to

610
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
a more classical approach of uh

611
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,720
vendors and build out of

612
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,320
those 5g networks as they were

613
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,679
announced but uh still it is it is a a

614
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:14,640
valid point

615
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,360
and we we know we we have to make the

616
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,320
assessments

617
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,200
of the pros and the cons of such

618
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,960
technologies but this is definitely

619
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,760
something

620
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,600
we will go through in the in the coming

621
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,679
years over to you and it

622
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,919
thank you um we're coming to the

623
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
questions also from the audience here so

624
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
kindly do you repair your questions

625
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,919
uh i would just ask my question now and

626
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,520
and then you have also time to just

627
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,000
stand up

628
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,159
and ask your question here so so my

629
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,000
question first before we go here um to

630
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,200
the audience is

631
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,280
what needs to happen so that 5g becomes

632
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,200
a driving platform for innovation and

633
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,400
competitiveness

634
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,880
across europe i would turn this question

635
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,200
now all the way to pierce

636
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
uh thank you well first of all i'm going

637
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,240
to sound very boring but

638
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,640
i have to say the first thing is that we

639
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,760
have the spectrum

640
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,600
uh pioneer bands made available and

641
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,280
particularly the mid bands as we already

642
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,799
moved towards the high bands

643
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,120
why it's because a lot of the low

644
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,679
latency but also you know high

645
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,559
data bearing capacity will be on that

646
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,600
mid band

647
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
that that's that's a message i just have

648
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,360
to hammer home

649
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,880
but then of course there's a lot more to

650
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,400
do we have to facilitate 5g deployments

651
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,000
everywhere so as well as the finance

652
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,559
models which we don't uh kid ourselves

653
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,320
that the the european union financial

654
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,280
contribution

655
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,039
is still a very small amount of the

656
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
overall investment required

657
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
so what we have to do is that we have to

658
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,080
not just

659
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,200
push and support mnos but help them to

660
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,960
convince the investment community about

661
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,120
the solidity of the investment case

662
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,919
for a rapid rollout and that comes as

663
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:50,320
i've said

664
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,240
partly from the demand for the new

665
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,600
business models

666
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,120
where very important european

667
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,880
industries such as the automotive

668
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,799
industry are already

669
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,760
pushing to move to to what i would say a

670
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,720
fully 5g

671
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,760
world fully 5g enabled world for every

672
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,240
element

673
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,919
of their production line every element

674
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,760
of the ecosystem and value chain

675
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
and that will be reproduced across

676
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,039
different business sectors

677
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,240
that will give us not just the um

678
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,159
the innovation it will also give us

679
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,919
greater security

680
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,080
as industry as all aspects of the

681
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,799
economy and society become more relevant

682
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,600
and more dependent on communications

683
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,039
technologies

684
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,080
and in doing all of that we do actually

685
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,919
have to look and this is a challenge for

686
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,039
the regulators that

687
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,240
michel needs we also have to look at

688
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,799
using our regulatory tools to allow more

689
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,240
shared infrastructure

690
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,720
particularly in remote locations

691
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,320
particularly in terms of the deployment

692
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,520
of base stations

693
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,320
we also have to increase capacity in

694
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,080
areas where it wouldn't be

695
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,120
profitable for one operator to invest on

696
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,000
their own

697
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,320
in the networks and we think that that

698
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,679
will pay back

699
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,840
to the economy and to the society as a

700
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,120
whole

701
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,679
we do also have to see some imagination

702
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,520
and enterprise in europe

703
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,880
5g provides a great opportunity

704
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,000
for new business cases for new

705
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,679
innovations so that is not just meeting

706
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,880
the needs

707
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
of businesses at the moment but actually

708
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,880
developing new business cases

709
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,000
and the last aspect but it's a very

710
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,679
important one is actually with regard to

711
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,679
public administrations

712
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,679
and public organizations and authorities

713
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,520
who can avail of 5g to modernize

714
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,240
their service provision to drive down

715
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,120
cost

716
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,919
and make their services more attractive

717
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,000
not just to the public but also again

718
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
to the business communities so that they

719
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
can encourage

720
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,120
for example the development of smes

721
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,000
in clusters not necessarily near to main

722
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,799
cities

723
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,559
which will have a great beneficial

724
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,080
effect but which will be

725
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,799
empowered and enabled by the compute

726
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,679
power of

727
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,480
5g and edge computing working together i

728
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,679
could go on

729
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,320
but the the fact is that the technology

730
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,080
has all the promise and we now must

731
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,679
avail of that thank you i would actually

732
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,120
ask you to send me a question also from

733
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:19,760
willif

734
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
do you have anything to add regarding

735
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,200
how to

736
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,159
make 5g become becoming also a driving

737
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,600
platform for innovation

738
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,400
across europe yeah yeah thank you for

739
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,799
that

740
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,080
and and uh i think it's really important

741
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,960
to stress that

742
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
this is not a technology issue

743
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,240
technology is here it's be

744
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,120
being rolled out it's it's uh high

745
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,039
capacity networks

746
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,000
and it's uh sort of only about creating

747
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,559
the right

748
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,720
enabling conditions for for rollout also

749
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,159
in europe and coming

750
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,880
catching up i would say with uh with

751
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,360
other

752
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,720
uh regions uh of the world and it's uh

753
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,400
uh it's i mean we are coming back to the

754
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,880
same

755
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,039
key messages here it's it's about

756
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,400
mid-band spectrum

757
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,919
it's about also stimulating uh uh

758
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,279
uh use cases for for for businesses uh

759
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,039
in particular who will be the main

760
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,880
beneficiaries of of

761
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,320
full 5g and it's also uh

762
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
about uh public funding it will play an

763
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,679
important role

764
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,039
i'm sure and and will the rrf uh uh

765
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,919
uh becoming operational in in many

766
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,799
member states

767
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,679
uh uh more and more uh that will play

768
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,080
play

769
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,360
a a vital role here uh and

770
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,320
uh as also pierce was was uh referring

771
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:40,720
to

772
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,240
uh uh to to uh create the right

773
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,120
incentives

774
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,080
uh uh when it comes to investments and

775
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,240
that's it's about predictability of the

776
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,279
regulatory environment

777
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,640
and also ensure that the operators

778
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,279
have visibility and predictability when

779
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,080
it comes to

780
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,640
the license conditions etc so there is a

781
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,760
setup and we

782
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,520
there's no rocket science here we we

783
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,600
know what what what is being required

784
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,919
and just to to apply that now and then

785
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,480
i think europe has a bright future for

786
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
5g

787
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,200
great um then i also i would like both

788
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,240
of you appears and

789
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,919
i know to talk about a little bit more

790
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,679
defiantly corridors

791
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,159
um there is a vision pen new 5g creators

792
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,720
for connected and automated mobility

793
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,159
can you maybe elaborate this a little

794
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,240
bit more in details

795
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,360
maybe pierce you go ahead first sure i'm

796
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,240
very happy to

797
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,520
um it has always been our wish

798
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,399
that we have first of all large-scale

799
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,440
pilots sort of

800
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,559
the deployment at scale of 5g

801
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,399
to show business industry and

802
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,840
governments just

803
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,679
what it can provide and the the idea of

804
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:52,399
the theme

805
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,480
of 5g corridors on major transport paths

806
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,480
crisscrossing european countries

807
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,120
will also bring another key issue that

808
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,279
we want to develop which is that this is

809
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,240
for the digital single market

810
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,919
there will be regulatory challenges

811
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,320
there again but if we think of one of

812
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,080
the key use cases we've been looking at

813
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,880
which is

814
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,279
an extension of manufacturing is

815
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,960
actually the logistics and transport

816
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,919
business

817
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,039
where as we saw during covid if we

818
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,600
have blockages at borders then the

819
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,120
single market stops working

820
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,960
and very quickly business runs into

821
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,120
trouble we run into supply chains to the

822
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,240
extent that people

823
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,320
are worried about food not appearing on

824
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,480
the shelves of their supermarkets

825
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,559
now 5g offers a lot more than that but

826
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,559
this is a great example where

827
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,679
by ensuring continuous 5g coverage

828
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,240
of these transport paths as they cross

829
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,120
from one country

830
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,279
into another you will have the full

831
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,279
benefits of internet of things

832
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,840
of edge computing and simply of logistic

833
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,039
manager in control

834
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,120
it means greater efficiency including

835
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,840
the environmental benefits and transport

836
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,039
but also if we are supporting the

837
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:05,840
rollout

838
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,880
the development of the 5g radia access

839
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,919
network

840
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,240
which would in itself draw down more of

841
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,399
the backhoe the fiber rollout

842
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,919
that then brings fiber and 5g into rural

843
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,279
areas in many cases

844
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,679
mountainous regions etc which otherwise

845
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,640
would not get 5g for some time

846
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,559
so this has been the subject already of

847
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,840
several

848
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,240
programs pilots funded under our 5g

849
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,559
public private partnership our research

850
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,399
program under the previous

851
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,559
european union research that is now

852
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,520
being mirrored

853
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,919
in our new horizon europe planning under

854
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,679
the new joint undertaking but more

855
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,640
importantly

856
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,480
we now have this fund called the

857
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,159
connecting europe facility

858
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,480
which will be devoted once one part of

859
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,360
it of course

860
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,080
uh under under uh seth broadband will be

861
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
devoted to the corridors

862
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,880
where groups of member states come

863
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,519
together

864
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,240
and better from the pilots we've already

865
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:02,960
run

866
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,240
these cross-border corridor systems

867
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
so you will have end-to-end real 5g

868
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,279
standalone 5g

869
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,760
operating on these routes and then the

870
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,480
ability

871
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,919
at a lower cost to take spur lines if

872
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,799
you like off

873
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,760
into the regions that are passed through

874
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,679
in order to ensure the acceleration of

875
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,519
the rollout so it has a multiplier

876
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,480
effect

877
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,320
with a relatively small amount of

878
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,159
european taxpayers money

879
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,600
associated with what businesses are

880
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,679
prepared to put in and of course local

881
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,480
government

882
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
we then have a significant investment

883
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,679
that accelerates 5g

884
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,480
great um also well if um do you have

885
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,080
anything to add from the ericsson

886
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,480
point of view yeah yeah very very

887
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,880
briefly i concur with with pierce here

888
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,679
and erickson

889
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,799
is very much involved in in one of these

890
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,000
corridors

891
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,480
in in between the baltic nations uh

892
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,960
estonia latvia and lithuania

893
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,600
and we also identify and of course as

894
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,279
does the transport and logistics

895
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,000
companies

896
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,200
the the potential of 5g and and when we

897
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,760
talk to companies like like uh

898
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,080
volvo group for example i mean they they

899
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,080
are they they are also

900
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,559
sharing our frustration that that 5g is

901
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,600
not happening

902
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,640
uh fast enough in europe and and

903
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,039
also emphasizing what peers said here

904
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,720
that this takes for

905
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,640
for for a harmonized approach

906
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,159
cooperative approach

907
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,080
between the member states of the

908
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,320
european union that is fundamental to

909
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,440
this i mean we

910
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,240
we can't have initiatives that that's

911
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,799
that's

912
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,120
stop at the national borders here we

913
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,519
need to have the european perspective

914
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:44,960
in everything we do in this space

915
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,480
um again can i go ahead

916
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,880
no no no go ahead there's one other very

917
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,840
important issue

918
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,039
which i really should have mentioned

919
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,880
which of course another of the

920
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,799
technology policies that we're pursuing

921
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,480
where we feel that europe will be

922
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,440
in the lead is in relation to connected

923
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,279
and autonomous mobility

924
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:06,880
where uh with the use of 5g and other

925
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,080
technologies

926
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,919
we will be able to accelerate the

927
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,000
development of

928
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,360
driver support autonomous mobility

929
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,480
and much more intelligent and safe and

930
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,720
also environmentally friendly transport

931
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,000
particularly in the

932
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,159
goods transport industry where the

933
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,360
lorries will be able to

934
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
work operate much more efficiently and

935
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,360
safely so that is actually

936
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,120
very good for the environment very good

937
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,440
for business and also very good for

938
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,080
safety

939
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,760
and that will also be the use case to

940
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,159
allow europe to develop

941
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,440
these cam technologies as we call them

942
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,200
uh in competition with other regions of

943
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,120
the world so sorry for breaking in again

944
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,919
but that's very important

945
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,519
absolutely no worries that's what panel

946
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,039
discussions are for

947
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,279
i would now turn to you michelle and and

948
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,960
ask a question we brought it out here a

949
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,159
couple of sectors what

950
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,880
5g is successful for um and like

951
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,799
mobility but there is plenty of other

952
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,320
sectors as well that we can use this

953
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,440
vast connection

954
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
um what do you think what are the

955
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,200
sectors that eu would take a leader

956
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,760
position of using a 5g connection

957
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,760
thank you very much annette uh well

958
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,960
um from a regulator perspective it's

959
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,359
it's

960
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,159
it's not a real easy question to to to

961
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,119
answer

962
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,239
it is more economical

963
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,280
related than related to the regulation

964
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,480
of the regulatory uh coming from

965
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,320
stemming from the regulatory framework

966
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,679
so

967
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,800
what we try to do is providing

968
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,440
a framework that based on a

969
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,879
non-discriminatory approach for all

970
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:43,440
types

971
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,480
of of users including an industry

972
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,440
of course which is is the main focus of

973
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:49,839
uh

974
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,960
of 5g and so without real

975
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,000
uh differentiating between sectors

976
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,119
of types of uh of industries

977
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,000
and so it's it's not really up to to us

978
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,560
to

979
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,920
to try to to help more one type of uh

980
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,560
sector than than another and to to pick

981
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,280
and choose

982
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,880
uh winners in in this in this area

983
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,000
let's uh we'll see and um please

984
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
also mentioned is that there is a lot of

985
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,520
trials across

986
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,880
europe and we also uh held a

987
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
stakeholder workshop

988
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,520
a few mo a few weeks ago and it was

989
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,160
really

990
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,720
interesting to hear from our vertical

991
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,520
actors

992
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,000
what they are going to do and what they

993
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,680
are still implementing

994
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,839
from different sectors in the industry

995
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,359
like shipyards of

996
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,560
automotive um refers to

997
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,680
but not really easy for for us

998
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,760
as uh regulators to to see which type of

999
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,640
sector will be the leading one in europe

1000
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,400
anyone else want to want to add like

1001
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,920
which sectors uh

1002
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,200
you should take the leading welder

1003
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,240
here's well i can just uh uh jump in and

1004
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,640
as

1005
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,000
as we saw in our study we think that

1006
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,320
that smart manufacturing i mean europe

1007
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,440
is uh

1008
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,160
one of the world leading regions when it

1009
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,599
comes to manufacturing

1010
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,720
and and uh we have then a great

1011
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,520
potential

1012
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,240
uh to digitize manufacturing uh to have

1013
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,760
smart manufacturing

1014
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,000
i think that there's a huge potential

1015
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,320
but also as we saw in our studies

1016
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,000
in agriculture i mean smart agriculture

1017
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,920
is also an area where i think

1018
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,119
we can increase european competitiveness

1019
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,320
with the application of 5g

1020
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,400
great uh moving on to the next question

1021
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,800
here both private and public financing

1022
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
can be sometimes very difficult to

1023
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,240
access for the smes which have brought

1024
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,880
it up here

1025
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,920
a couple of times for them to develop 5g

1026
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,240
applications and business models as well

1027
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,160
the eu and member states funding remains

1028
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,440
clearly crucial

1029
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,599
when it comes to usmes from very early

1030
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,960
stages

1031
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,680
already however there is no dedicated

1032
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,599
society focused programs available

1033
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,720
at the eu level as smes uh are

1034
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,200
starting to play more essential role in

1035
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,560
a global ecosystem

1036
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,160
do you think it should be vital for the

1037
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
european uh union to take further

1038
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,240
actions to try fire to innovation

1039
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,040
and how could europe support 5g related

1040
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,280
smes i would turn this question to

1041
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,599
pierce

1042
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,480
well thank you yes the the role but also

1043
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,760
the potential

1044
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,040
of european smes is very significant

1045
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,160
so um we have had and do still and will

1046
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,079
continue to fund

1047
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,480
innovation in general for for smes and

1048
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,359
startups

1049
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,359
but specifically on 5g which is your

1050
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,560
question which i which

1051
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,960
i think is totally justified the first

1052
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,240
thing is to say that

1053
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,359
we are changing our research model we've

1054
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:57,040
had a very successful public private

1055
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,720
partnership focusing on research

1056
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,280
and innovation we're now moving to a

1057
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,720
model which is called a joint

1058
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,839
undertaking

1059
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:07,680
it will do research in 5g beyond 5g and

1060
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,520
maybe even start some work on what will

1061
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,720
be 6g

1062
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,520
but it is also an instrument to work on

1063
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,040
deployment

1064
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,359
on innovation on the development of

1065
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,880
these use cases

1066
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
and on developing ecosystems

1067
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,640
specifically to allow

1068
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,160
smes uh to to to participate and to

1069
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
benefit

1070
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,320
so that's that's one key area uh where

1071
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,880
in

1072
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,520
looking at in providing financing for

1073
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,800
the testing

1074
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,440
of of ideas from smes we actually give

1075
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,200
them the opportunity to receive

1076
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,560
support of course the main

1077
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,240
investment funds of the european union

1078
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,599
not just the rrf

1079
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,680
which is very big but it wants off but

1080
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,640
also eu

1081
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,079
invest and some of the other funds will

1082
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,560
increasingly be looking at digital as

1083
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,359
you know for example the rrf funds 20

1084
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,280
of those funds must go on digital

1085
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,560
projects

1086
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,280
and we expect even more in relation to

1087
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,040
eu invest etc

1088
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,640
and that will focus on what is europe's

1089
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,680
natural powerhouse and

1090
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,760
ulf will have no problem i know in

1091
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,280
recognizing this we have some

1092
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,560
major global leaders here in europe

1093
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,480
who are at the forefront of our drive

1094
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,160
with regard to 5g and other

1095
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,640
communications technologies and networks

1096
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,800
and in their slipstream but also now

1097
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,880
maybe even cutting across

1098
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,560
them are startups disruptive smes

1099
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,240
whom we need for the business ecosystem

1100
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,720
if europe is to thrive so that is a real

1101
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,720
focus of the joint undertaking

1102
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,920
and it will also be a focus of our

1103
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,480
digital europe program where we are

1104
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,240
seeking to roll out

1105
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,800
a number of digital technologies uh

1106
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,400
talking about artificial intelligence

1107
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,640
hpc but now specifically

1108
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,680
in cloud and in 5g we will see

1109
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,079
smaller companies for example working on

1110
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:00,880
on telco

1111
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,119
edge provision and in providing

1112
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,280
innovative technologies and services

1113
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,760
with european funding we hope and expect

1114
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,280
that the member states will match that

1115
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,079
funding

1116
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,040
so that we do now create a real

1117
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,920
innovative

1118
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
entrepreneurial environment for smes to

1119
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,760
grow

1120
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,359
um there is also the question that i

1121
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,000
would last actually like to ask from

1122
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
all of our panelists here so we we also

1123
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,319
talk about very often

1124
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,359
um the awareness of iot and channel like

1125
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,319
in public

1126
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,400
do you think that um should the european

1127
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,079
union focus more on improving the

1128
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,040
understanding

1129
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,240
and awareness of 5g of investors too and

1130
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,200
how has these

1131
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,240
been addressed uh these days uh maybe

1132
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,119
mikhail over to you um do you think that

1133
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,720
we should be focusing more on raising

1134
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,400
the awareness and especially

1135
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,000
also the investors but of course also

1136
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,200
the public awareness of 5t connection

1137
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,440
thank you very much and this is a very

1138
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,520
interesting question of course

1139
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,800
and as you probably know for years

1140
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,319
um we have here that um

1141
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,839
this sector is over regulated

1142
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,079
and uh the good news it's not the case

1143
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,520
anymore and this is the background of

1144
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,280
the european electronic communications

1145
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,000
code

1146
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,280
with an overarching um objective

1147
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,560
towards um efficient uh investment so

1148
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,599
this is a

1149
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,040
a very um investment friendly

1150
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,640
environment complemented by um the beric

1151
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,200
guidelines to ensure the consistent and

1152
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
harmonized implementation

1153
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,480
over uh europe second element um

1154
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,880
if you compare the situation with the

1155
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,640
situation many years ago

1156
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,000
there's less less markets it needs to be

1157
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,200
regulated so we are going a little by

1158
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,760
little

1159
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,040
towards the uh application of general uh

1160
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,920
competition

1161
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,720
low in the in this in this sector uh as

1162
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,520
well

1163
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,560
moreover um in in this framework

1164
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,760
you have also uh some very important

1165
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,560
tools

1166
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,839
to uh incentivize investments such as

1167
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,839
uh co-investment schemes on this

1168
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,119
there is a lot of work to to to do

1169
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,240
and but there are already some

1170
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,560
co-investments agreements with different

1171
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,839
forms just to

1172
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,599
lower the costs um peers referred

1173
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,520
also more specifically regarding 5g

1174
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,680
the possibility to uh share

1175
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,800
infrastructure and

1176
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,440
infrastructure sharing is something we

1177
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,920
really

1178
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,400
support with uh barrack we adopted two

1179
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,440
years ago

1180
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,839
a common position on that where we

1181
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,920
described different parameters

1182
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,960
and and so this is uh an important tool

1183
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,280
as well to lower the cost and and

1184
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,400
improve the

1185
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,440
the coverage and as i have already

1186
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,000
mentioned

1187
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
the the brilliant cost reduction

1188
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,760
directive we also

1189
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,400
once reviewed played a role to

1190
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,599
facilitate

1191
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,640
the rollout and the deployment of 5g

1192
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,280
and so to lower the cost which is also

1193
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,560
good news for

1194
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,200
the the investor to be my my answer so

1195
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,319
far

1196
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,960
thank you um now also um very short

1197
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,640
answers from uh from both piers and an

1198
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,440
old festival

1199
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,079
um how how does erickson and how does

1200
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,760
the european commission address these uh

1201
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,040
raising awareness of

1202
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,200
fighting here so i think uh

1203
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,599
yeah i think globesick is doing a

1204
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,800
fantastic job by just

1205
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,319
organizing this event so i think

1206
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,839
uh awareness is is there but but i think

1207
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:38,400
we just need to continue to to stress

1208
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,720
how important 5g is for for for

1209
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,839
competitiveness

1210
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,880
and and and of europe

1211
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,440
uh it's a fundamental innovation

1212
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,319
platform for

1213
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,119
all for all our societies and all our

1214
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,560
businesses

1215
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,400
and i think it's great that the rrf

1216
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,680
is identifying 20 for ict investments

1217
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,400
but as i said uh and then of course it's

1218
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,160
up to the member states to continue to

1219
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,359
drive that and

1220
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,599
make use of it in there in the way that

1221
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,480
has been

1222
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,520
been decided but also to understand that

1223
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,680
that 5g will also play a role

1224
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,880
for for the green uh transformation

1225
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,960
uh because it's it's not only a creating

1226
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
efficiencies and productivity increases

1227
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
but it also helps us take us to

1228
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,359
to a more sustainable future and

1229
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,040
sustainable businesses

1230
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,720
so thank you thank you and i i would

1231
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,560
just have to cut you off from here uh

1232
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,079
and pierce uh in two sentences uh how we

1233
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,400
how should we raise the awareness of

1234
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,280
five t

1235
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,480
two sentences only uh

1236
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,920
there won't be a sort of a public

1237
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,440
publicity campaign because that's not

1238
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,560
what it's about

1239
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:48,560
we will continue to work with different

1240
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,079
business sectors to help

1241
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:52,480
them to actually work out the use cases

1242
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,520
and show

1243
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,640
how business can actually find that on

1244
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,160
the technology so 5g

1245
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,800
applications in the in the sectors are

1246
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,400
the way to convince them

1247
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,560
and their investors that it's the way

1248
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,079
