[Music] Mr. President

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,950
 thank you for your kind invitation to participate via this video

3
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:29,390
 message to the sixteenth edition of the globe sec tread forum dedicated to

4
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:38,900
 theme of the in the world back beta I greet you all the organizers i

5
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,850
 Attending this conference I would like to express my gratitude for

6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:51,890
 the platform that the bratislava forum offers to the important debate on

7
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,530
 reconstruction of our world after the pandemic experience that us

8
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:04,430
 it forces us to confront a series of ecological socio-economic issues

9
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:12,649
 and serious and all interrelated policies in this regard I would like to propose to you

10
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:20,900
 some ideas taking inspiration from the trinomial method to see and judge

11
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:28,790
 take action see a serious and honest analysis of the past that includes the

12
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,740
 recognition of the systematic deficiencies of the errors committed e

13
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:41,810
 of the lack of responsibility towards creators, neighbor and creation

14
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,530
 it seems to me essential to develop an idea of ​​recovery that aims not only at

15
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,009
 rebuild what was there but fix what doesn't already work

16
00:01:54,009 --> 00:02:00,790
 before the advent of the colon to virus and which contributed to aggravate the crisis

17
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,130
 whoever wants to get up from a fall must deal with the circumstances of the

18
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:13,390
 own collapse recognize the elements of responsibility I see a world everywhere

19
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:20,109
 who has been fooled by an illusory sense of security based on hunger

20
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:25,060
 of earnings I see a model of economic life e

21
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,720
 social characterized by many inequalities and selfishness in which

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,820
 a tiny minority of the world's population owns the

23
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:44,489
 majority of assets often do not hesitate to exploit people and resources

24
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:51,459
 I see a lifestyle that doesn't care enough for the environment it is

25
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:58,540
 accustomed to consuming and destroying without restraint what belongs to everyone

26
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,679
 and it must be safeguarded with respect that the ecological debt borne above all by the

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,480
 poor and future generations

28
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:16,420
 judge the second step and evaluate what has been seen by saying goodbye to my parents

29
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,040
 collaborators of the Roman curia on the occasion of last Christmas

30
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,829
 I made a first reflection on the meaning of the crisis the crisis opens

31
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,250
 new possibilities is in fact an open challenge to face the situation

32
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,459
 current to transform the time of trial into a time of choice, a crisis

33
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:47,080
 in fact it forces you to choose for good or for evil from a crisis like I have

34
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,350
 already repeated it does not come out the same or it comes out better or it comes out worse but

35
00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:00,730
 the same never judging what we have seen and experienced encourages us to improve

36
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,470
 let's take advantage of this time to take steps forward

37
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:12,820
 the crisis that has hit everyone reminds us that no one is saved alone

38
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,139
 the crisis opens the way to a future that recognizes true equality

39
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:26,860
 of every human being not an abstract but concrete equality that offers to

40
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:39,130
 people to peoples fair and real opportunities for development take action

41
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,409
 it wastes the opportunities offered by the crisis to act in the face of injustices

42
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,380
 social and marginalization requires a development model that places it at the center

43
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,909
 every man is the whole man as a fundamental pillar to be respected and protected

44
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:03,130
 adopting a methodology that includes the literature of solidarity and charity

45
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,770
 politics every action needs a vision

46
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:15,130
 a vision that one has of the whole and of hope a vision like that of

47
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:22,120
 biblical prophet isaiah who saw the swords transmuting into alatri the spears into

48
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,580
 sickle act for the development of all and carry out a work of conversion

49
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:37,240
 first of all decisions are converted death into life weapons on TV but we have

50
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,810
 everyone also needs to undertake an ecological conversion the vision of

51
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:49,900
 together it includes in fact the perspective of a yarn intended as a common home e

52
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:56,198
 urgently requires action to protect their dear animated friends from

53
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,990
 hope that comes from god hope your exchanges these days

54
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,090
 contribute to a model of recovery capable of generating pro solutions

55
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,530
 inclusive and sustainable a development model that is founded

56
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:18,190
 on peaceful coexistence between peoples and on harmony with creation

57
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,510
 good job and thanks
