questions from the audience over the

115
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,520

116
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
hour uh let me just remind you that a

please keep your questions uh brief and

119
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,400
i would ask the people in the room here

120
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,120
to

121
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,320
stand up so with no further ado

122
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,880
uh let's begin and i would like to start

123
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,520
with you

124
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,720
minister scheinbeck if if i could

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,160
uh you come from a country that

126
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,639
is famous for being uh neutral some

127
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,360
would say

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,840
uh maybe too neutral on on some subjects

129
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
when you are looking at this issue of

130
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,840
uh you know the role that the eu should

131
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,720
play on

132
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
the global stage i mean especially today

133
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,880
when we think about the summit meeting

134
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
that is going to take place

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,199
in geneva in a few hours it's notable

136
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,000
that the eu

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,639
isn't going to be at that table should

138
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,600
the eu

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,759
have more of a role here will it ever be

140
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,000
at the big boys table as some people

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,199
call it

142
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,039
well first of all thank you for thank

143
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,479
you for the invitation it's great to be

144
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,520
here and it's really

145
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,280
awesome i have to say to see so many

146
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,199
people in in 3d

147
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,639
physically uh it makes a difference and

148
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,800
it's a good sign that we are slowly

149
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,840
getting out of this uh uh uh situation

150
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
we had in the last 12 months

151
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,000
um well thank you for the question

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,039
because it's it's funny

153
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,479
i have heard already the country that

154
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,080
austria is not neutral enough

155
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,080
lately so from our perspective

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,400
uh in the last 25 years after joining

157
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,000
european union neutrality was never an

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,039
issue and i believe

159
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,319
this is not the issue on the european

160
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,240
level and yes we should

161
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,800
claim our seed in the table of of of the

162
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,840
big players and

163
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
and we actually are sit we're already

164
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
sitting there um

165
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
if we do the soul-searching europe we're

166
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,120
extremely good at talking ourselves down

167
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,319
sometimes

168
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,000
we have this tendency of seeing the

169
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,080
deficiencies and not looking at the

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,440
things that are actually working it's

171
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,960
the same thing on common market and

172
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,240
other european issues

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,039
we don't see the 80 working we only stay

174
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:23,919
at the 20

175
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,400
which might be difficult and we are

176
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,039
still

177
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,199
at the biggest worldwide donor of of

178
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,880
foreign aid we are

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,960
an economic bloc we are a financial

180
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,639
block we are a trade bloc

181
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,400
we have leverage the only thing is we

182
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,919
have to start using it

183
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
i believe the key word the buzzword we

184
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,680
should be using is less strategic

185
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,039
autonomy

186
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,000
but coherence capability to act and to

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,520
put our pieces together

188
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,440
because we have it and i believe even

189
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
and i we have it constantly in the

190
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,440
council

191
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,039
that we talk about issues and then we

192
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,280
say why don't we use our trade power why

193
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,960
don't we we are the biggest donor in a

194
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
certain area we had the biggest trade

195
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,919
power in a certain area

196
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,840
but we are not capable of putting that

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,360
you know spilling it over bringing it

198
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,080
over

199
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
to use it as a political means and this

200
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
is something which is a hard lesson for

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,039
europe to learn

202
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,120
i believe the thing is sometimes i

203
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,759
compare it if i can take a step back

204
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,759
after the fall of the iron curtain we

205
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,879
had this impression

206
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
everything the whole world will become

207
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,879
more european russia is moving towards

208
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,199
us

209
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
turkey is trying to take over european

210
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
standards then we had the phase of

211
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,280
hangover we woke up and we found out no

212
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,720
the world is not nice

213
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,639
the world is not moving and becoming

214
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,479
towards european union is not becoming

215
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,599
more european

216
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,679
and and the winds are getting rougher

217
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,958
for us and now we are

218
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,279
in this phase of waking up of becoming

219
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,120
getting sober again

220
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,919
and and being more realistic and it's a

221
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,720
steep

222
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
main sometimes painful learning curve

223
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
but we're doing it

224
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,040
consider for instance the fdi screening

225
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,200
we have established in 2018

226
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
foreign direct investments or simply the

227
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,240
wordings

228
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,279
i mean that we consider in eu documents

229
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,839
china as not only a partner and a

230
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,640
competitor

231
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,680
but also as a systemic rival

232
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,040
is something would have we would have

233
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,440
never done six to seven years ago

234
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,959
so things are progressing we're not

235
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,480
there yet but things are progressing on

236
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,839
that quickly because you mentioned china

237
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,080
there was also an attempt over the past

238
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,480
uh

239
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,279
several weeks to have a joint eu

240
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,000
statement

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
on china uh criticizing china for the

242
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,920
human rights abuses there that has been

243
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,360
blocked by hungary

244
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
because we have the system of unanimity

245
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,760
within the

246
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,440
uh eu-27 you talk about coherence and

247
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
yet it seems that

248
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,959
still every country pretty much is

249
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,160
pursuing its own

250
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
uh foreign policy your own country

251
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
recently i think you just hinted at the

252
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,000
criticism of the neutrality

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,080
uh which also happens to be my country

254
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,279
uh raised the

255
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,360
israeli flag on the top of both the

256
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
foreign ministry and the uh

257
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,279
the chancellery a few weeks ago uh was

258
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,720
criticized for that

259
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
so how do you create this coherence

260
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
because it doesn't really seem

261
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,839
uh to be there at the moment i don't

262
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,440
believe that koreans has anything

263
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,279
anything to do with a qualified majority

264
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,200
award yes i regret that we we didn't

265
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
manage to get a common approach in a

266
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,600
common vote

267
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,040
on on hong kong um but

268
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
i've been around for the treaty of nasa

269
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
negotiations i've been part of most

270
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,920
igc's as

271
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,800
as diplomat in the in the past 20 years

272
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,760
um even the

273
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,959
convention of the future of europe and

274
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,200
qmv is not the solution for everything

275
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,120
we have to be aware of that

276
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,480
one of the strengths that the european

277
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
union has is this

278
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,440
internal capacity of speaking with one

279
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,240
voice

280
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
and this credibility that brings that

281
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,680
comes along with it

282
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,440
so in the moment we have qmv probably

283
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
third countries would it wouldn't be a

284
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
secret who voted

285
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
against so who would tell us that the

286
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
chinese or russians or others would not

287
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
use this possibility to go to the

288
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
dissenting opinion and say

289
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
come on you don't agree we can do

290
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,880
something else i believe

291
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,120
and here again it's it's less about

292
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,560
procedural issues

293
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
it's about the political will it's about

294
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:03,680
this

295
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,279
you could say political culture in the

296
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,399
council and i hope we have the

297
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,240
possibility to talk about it later on

298
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,519
because i believe there are many things

299
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,399
we can do

300
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,360
and i believe that the high

301
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,040
representative joseph broyle is moving

302
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,079
into the right direction

303
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,720
mandating ministers to do trips on his

304
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,600
behalf

305
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,399
and and other things and it's more the

306
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,360
political

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,680
will that we need than structural

308
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,720
changes and that is

309
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,120
because coherence is the same thing um

310
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,399
if we if we

311
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,959
start overcoming these blockages which

312
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,560
we have even within the commission that

313
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,600
the dga

314
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
doesn't want to know what the dgb is

315
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,440
doing or say this is my garden

316
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,839
i i tend to it alone and we have the

317
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,279
same thing on national level this is not

318
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,839
a criticism this is a coherence is a

319
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,160
challenge for every administration

320
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,399
and i believe if we get better at it the

321
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,920
most the stronger we will be

322
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,600
internationally

323
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,240
ivan korchok your country is also one of

324
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
the smaller members of the eu

325
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,800
is not known to be a big fan of we

326
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,240
always say mid-sized countries

327
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,720
how do you achieve this goal of

328
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,079
coherence in your view

329
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,000
that minister schallenberg just raised

330
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,920
i wish i knew but the funny thing is

331
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,360
that with my friend alexander

332
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,320
charlemagne by the way who who has a

333
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,600
substantial

334
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
contribution to the fact that i am

335
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,760
foreign minister

336
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,600
because uh because he

337
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,320
offered me a repatriation flight the

338
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
last one from

339
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,160
washington by which i managed to get

340
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,639
home

341
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,800
to be sworn in as a as a foreign

342
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
minister so

343
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,200
i got something in the cars from

344
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,360
slovakia yes

345
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,200
not to do it so

346
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,279
so from day one we we really

347
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,360
became a very very good colleagues but

348
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,040
i'm mentioning that as well

349
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,760
because when entering the room and and

350
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,639
mr carnegie

351
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,760
i encourage him to start with uh with

352
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,440
alexander and he said well it's

353
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,120
difficult because always i speak after

354
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,160
you he said

355
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,639
and he always said i agree with me and

356
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,320
this time i want to make a bit more

357
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,760
provocative

358
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,839
because i am speaking after you and i i

359
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,200
do not agree that much

360
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,320
with uh with what you said because

361
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,279
it's it's right that we as a european

362
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
union

363
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,360
have um capacities that we have ambition

364
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
no doubt about it to play a

365
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,040
global role nevertheless when you look

366
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,720
at the output i think it's

367
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
it's not what it should be

368
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,279
i believe i am inspired by yesterday's

369
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,040
contribution of our president

370
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,600
uh zuzana chabutawa what she said in the

371
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
in her contribution

372
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,240
and and partly by the pope francis

373
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,040
who said that in a way that any soul

374
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,760
searching

375
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,600
this is the title of the panel start

376
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,680
with recognizing reality

377
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,240
in which we are living and i have here

378
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,279
four points

379
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,959
where i believe which i believe are

380
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,279
worth recalling all the time

381
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,600
in order to realize in what kind of

382
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,880
world we are living in

383
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,920
in what kind of world the eu claims its

384
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,800
its ambition to become a global player

385
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,360
what is underway is geopolitical shift

386
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,240
from euro-atlantic to indo-pacific

387
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,839
region and that's not a theory

388
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,800
that's happening as we speak right now

389
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,519
second

390
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,120
our model of governance is getting

391
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
more and more under pressure and i think

392
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
john ellen who was awarded yesterday

393
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,959
spoke eloquently

394
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,920
about that liberal democracy gets under

395
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,600
pressure it's being questioned

396
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,920
it's being questioned not by our

397
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,639
opponents

398
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,120
it's very often questioned by by

399
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,880
ourselves

400
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,800
number three the power struggle

401
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,639
continues to move from traditional

402
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,839
domain

403
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,320
to competition in the area of technology

404
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
and the question is whether we can

405
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,639
basically live up or to to that

406
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,120
to that challenge and omnipresent issue

407
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,240
of demography

408
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,560
so i think president chapito was right

409
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,760
when she said we need

410
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,560
a joint perception of this to see this

411
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,519
reality

412
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,160
and to set the ambition right for us for

413
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,000
european union to be a global player

414
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,560
that brings me to my second point

415
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
and that contradicts a little bit the

416
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,240
doses of optimism which my friend

417
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,360
brought today from vienna friends am i

418
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,560
the longer i am in this business

419
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,759
the the more i'm asking myself whether

420
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,040
we've set it right

421
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,079
our ambition to be a global

422
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,199
player a european union i'm not giving

423
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:37,759
up that

424
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,360
ambition but i'm asking don't forget the

425
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,920
eu

426
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,920
was created more than what 70 years ago

427
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,079
in order to basically

428
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,880
not to project our interest externally

429
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,440
beyond our borders but rather to curb

430
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,399
power within or amongst the member

431
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,120
states

432
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,079
that was the original idea the dna on

433
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,920
which the eu was built

434
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,440
to prevent countries you know waging war

435
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,959
amongst ourselves but

436
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,040
in the 60s and later on the 70s there

437
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,279
was not a single idea that we would

438
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,320
be expected to exert and

439
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
and show power and project power

440
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,120
externally and all of a sudden because

441
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
the world has changed so much

442
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,519
dramatically of course there is no other

443
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,279
way but to claim it

444
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,399
but if you look at the respective areas

445
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,560
which influence the global developments

446
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,079
where are we he's right

447
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,000
my friend alexander with the development

448
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,360
policy and so on

449
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
uh development assistance that's right

450
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,440
but shouldn't we

451
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,079
instead of reclaiming the global

452
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,120
ambition

453
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,120
start somehow rethinking

454
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,079
the level of ambition that we want that

455
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,959
we want to

456
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,720
project and that brings me to the third

457
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,399
point

458
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,199
i'm not a friend of grand strategies

459
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,160
because

460
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
you know every morning then you were

461
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,919
waking up and you were confronted that

462
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,599
while we have global ambition we have a

463
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,640
grand strategy but you have lukashenko

464
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
right and he and he and he exposes us to

465
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,000
our level of influence where we

466
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,839
basically see not only european union

467
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,000
but other other countries as well

468
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,439
well speaking about the countries i'd

469
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,039
like to bring in deputy minister

470
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,119
um quickly so but but maybe the last one

471
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,000
just to

472
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,280
round it up i'm rather friend of

473
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,960
sup strategies a smaller

474
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,400
clearly defined strategies vis-a-vis

475
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,120
or in those areas where we must deliver

476
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
it's the western balkans

477
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,960
definitely in the middle east where are

478
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
we there as european union where are we

479
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,799
as a european union when it comes to

480
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,400
solution of a conflict in

481
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
ukraine where are we in the north of of

482
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,440
africa so

483
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,480
rather more down-to-earth approach in

484
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,000
order not to be

485
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,840
disappointed each each and every time

486
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,120
when we

487
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,480
claim global global uh influence but

488
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,440
the output is suboptimal i would say

489
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,320
thank you very much sir

490
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,039
uh marina sereni um i'd like to bring

491
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,320
you into the discussion

492
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
uh evan kochok raises an interesting

493
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,440
point that the

494
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,120
eu as it has evolved is at a point now

495
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,039
where it might be aiming too high

496
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,640
and maybe it should stick to its

497
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,280
knitting a little bit more and focus on

498
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
places in the world that it can change

499
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
be it the western balkans

500
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,559
or looking at belarus and other places

501
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,039
you

502
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,919
represent one of the larger members of

503
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
of the eu

504
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,120
do you think from rome when you

505
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,280
look out at europe that the european

506
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,200
union needs to be playing a more

507
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,160
forceful role here or do you think that

508
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,120
the system

509
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
can continue to kind of muddle along as

510
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,080
it is now

511
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,960
thank you thank you very much for the

512
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,640
question and let me start

513
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,919
thanking mr korchok minister kochok for

514
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,559
his kind

515
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,039
invitation i'm really glad to be able to

516
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,240
participate

517
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,880
in the bratislava forum and i have to

518
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,760
the chance

519
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,880
of analyzing with you a theme of central

520
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,000
relevance of

521
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,280
uh for our common future uh the eu

522
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,240
wants to be a global player or in the

523
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,360
expression

524
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,440
used by both the president of the

525
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,799
commission and by the high

526
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,000
representative

527
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,039
a geopolitical actor this is a huge

528
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,600
challenge in my opinion it is also a

529
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
necessity

530
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,679
it is quite clear that no single eu

531
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:36,559
member state

532
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,520
can have a real impact on major

533
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,400
international

534
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,440
issues while a european union with a

535
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,400
united

536
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,440
position certainly will stand

537
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,880
better changes changes

538
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,440
the common foreign and security policy

539
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,280
as the ambition to be

540
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
the common foreign policy of 27 member

541
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,280
states

542
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,080
currently however it is often

543
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,360
only the minimum common denominator of

544
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,559
the 27

545
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,120
member states foreign policies this is

546
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,280
the price we have to pay

547
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,600
to have a common foreign policy

548
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,640
reconciling

549
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,720
national interests of 27 member states

550
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,600
these interests could diverge one from

551
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,640
from the other

552
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,200
and sometimes they could as well be in

553
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
conflict

554
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,120
one with the other i am convinced

555
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,159
that the eu should show in words

556
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,240
and indeed its capacity to act as a

557
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
geopolitical actor

558
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,600
especially in case of crisis like those

559
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,640
mentioned by

560
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,080
minister korchok especially in our own

561
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,039
uh neighborhood i'm thinking as an

562
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,159
example to the

563
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,799
mediterranean and middle east area and

564
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,840
specifically

565
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,720
to the middle east peace process recent

566
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,440
events

567
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,400
made it clear that this subject cannot

568
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,919
be put aside

569
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,720
but needs to be faced and solved if we

570
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
want peace and security

571
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,840
for the region and indirectly for europe

572
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,679
the european union can play a

573
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,880
significant role

574
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
within the quarter and in contact with

575
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
the parties

576
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,720
but it needs to show a coincident

577
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,679
position

578
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,919
in other words to speak with a single

579
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,960
voice or

580
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,840
with various voices if you want but

581
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,799
saying

582
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,080
the same thing we are not there for the

583
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,640
moment

584
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,440
and we are losing or we are we risk to

585
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,200
lose grounds

586
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,000
ground to other actors and we we have to

587
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,720
know this

588
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,280
in the current situation in order to

589
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,039
make sure that the eu

590
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,600
acts collectively in foreign policy it

591
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,039
is important to make an

592
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,400
effort to ensure the maximum convergence

593
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,919
among member states

594
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,159
we should strive to have a common

595
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,320
foreign and security policy

596
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,919
at the same time effective and

597
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:02,960
representative of the whole

598
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
membership uh there are indeed new tools

599
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
i would i would like to mention them

600
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,640
through which the eu aims at improving

601
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,799
its capacity to act in foreign and

602
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,000
security policy

603
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,400
i'm thinking for instance at the new

604
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,960
financial instrument for external

605
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,320
action in d.c who is

606
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,760
has been renominated global europe

607
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960
which should provide the eu geopolitical

608
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,760
effort

609
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,559
with the new operational architecture

610
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,559
able to better pursue

611
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,480
its political priorities including

612
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,640
the promotion of democracy the rule of

613
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,320
law and human rights

614
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,360
security migration and mobility trade

615
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:47,600
and

616
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,799
inclusive and sustainable growth in this

617
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,919
we will also prove instrumental in

618
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,280
helping us

619
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,799
solving another of our problems

620
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,840
that is the need to increase eu

621
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,080
visibility and projection

622
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,360
capacity while countering a negative

623
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,080
narrative

624
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,919
on our action abroad equally

625
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,760
i would like to mention the strategic

626
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,000
complex compass that eu

627
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,039
is bringing together the u is bringing

628
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,960
it together in a coherent way

629
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,320
or its security and defense tool it is

630
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,679
true uh minister korchok has said

631
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:30,720
before we we should not think

632
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,760
always in a strategic way for every

633
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,600
strike for having a strategy

634
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,039
but we need also some places where we

635
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:39,919
can

636
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,039
think uh strategically and

637
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,120
we need to have we need

638
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
we need to have these instruments

639
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,360
we need to have the possibility

640
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,480
to provide the eu with the ability to

641
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,960
act

642
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,480
autonomously when necessary but together

643
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,120
with others whenever possible and

644
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,400
these days with the united states we are

645
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,799
with

646
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,240
our principal allies is very clear and

647
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,159
very important for us

648
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,159
um thank you very much and i do think

649
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,279
that you raise an

650
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,840
interesting uh point danielle schwarzer

651
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,480
when

652
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,760
uh deputy minister sarini talks about

653
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,600
the lowest common denominator

654
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,679
and uh the uh implication there is that

655
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
there is a lowest common denominator and

656
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,480
in my view

657
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,760
there doesn't even seem to be a lowest

658
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,360
common denominator there is there is no

659
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,520
denominator often if you look at

660
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,400
policy towards places like russia or

661
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:42,960
china

662
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,400
recently uh the middle east

663
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,760
um you know is is is this

664
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,799
really a realistic way

665
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,279
forward uh or should the eu just

666
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,799
acknowledge that it doesn't have

667
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,080
a common foreign policy and won't until

668
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,039
it gets away

669
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,080
with uh qmv and maybe just concentrate

670
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,120
on other things

671
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,400
well thanks for that encouraging

672
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,720
question michael i i

673
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,720
you know i wouldn't agree with you there

674
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,320
is a common denominator

675
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,159
and if we just take the list that ivan

676
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,400
kocher gave us of the challenges we are

677
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,520
facing

678
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,440
i think if you start from there and you

679
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,480
ask any european government

680
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,600
whether the eu should be able to

681
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,640
at least protect itself if not impact on

682
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,600
global developments that really go to

683
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,240
the core

684
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,480
of our national systems because the

685
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,400
challenges that have been named

686
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
they they are not out there they are

687
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,919
within the european union they are

688
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,520
within member states if you just take

689
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,600
the topic of chinese or russian

690
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,120
interference within western liberal

691
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,880
democracies so

692
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,159
i would say there is a common

693
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,400
denominator however when we then look at

694
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
the question

695
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,120
do the member states share the answers

696
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,320
to handle some of the crisis and you

697
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
mentioned the middle east

698
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,360
we haven't talked about africa yet i

699
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,159
would put that into the picture as well

700
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,919
russia of course i think what we

701
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,360
definitely need to work on in the

702
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,320
european union is a very precise

703
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,440
risk and threat assessment and of course

704
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,400
the attention

705
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,799
of a country for instance like france

706
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,159
goes towards africa

707
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,720
goes towards the risk of terrorism while

708
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,000
if you go to poland

709
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,840
and you ask them what is your risk

710
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,600
assessment it is the physical threat of

711
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,480
russia

712
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,360
and it is the sense of undermining

713
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,400
democracy

714
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,559
within the european union by hybrid

715
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:35,440
threats

716
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
and so this is what the eu has to work

717
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,880
on and it has started and this

718
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,360
is what i find encouraging and the

719
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,120
deputy italian foreign minister just

720
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,760
said

721
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
the strategic compass is an important

722
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,840
tool forward and i think it is true

723
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,640
what is this basically the 27 member

724
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,559
states compare notes

725
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,360
on what they see out there as the most

726
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,440
important threats and challenges

727
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,840
and the conversation that is now ongoing

728
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,440
and i suppose the ministers will

729
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,200
will be able to evaluate whether there

730
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,120
is in fact progress in

731
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,159
in on the council level there is

732
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,400
a an effort to build a common

733
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,919
understanding

734
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,760
um and once we have that we can be

735
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,840
far more serious on the question of do

736
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
we have the instruments and i

737
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,919
you know the term strategic autonomy is

738
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,120
very often mentioned

739
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,480
i don't think we should discuss that

740
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,720
kind of abstract concept because

741
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,880
europeans don't project the same

742
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,440
notions into that what we need is a very

743
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,279
serious understanding

744
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,840
what capacity to act do we have and do

745
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,559
we need

746
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,720
and if we look at that picture it's grim

747
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,480
because we do not have the tools at our

748
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,679
disposal

749
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,120
let me just comment on why i think this

750
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,919
is so obviously the member states never

751
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:46,880
transferred

752
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,840
foreign or defense policy to the

753
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,880
european level

754
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,120
so you cannot blame the eu that it

755
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,720
doesn't deliver on that

756
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,320
you have to look at the member states

757
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,720
and you have to ask them are you serious

758
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,640
that individually you will be able to

759
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,559
tackle those challenges out there

760
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,880
is the right framework nato or do

761
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
europeans need to work more closely

762
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,440
together

763
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,000
and i do think if we take the impact of

764
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,640
the covet 19 crisis and the deep

765
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,200
pressure on national budgets there's an

766
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
even stronger case now

767
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,880
to enhance european cooperation on

768
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
defense within

769
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,679
the nato framework let me pick one other

770
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:24,559
example where

771
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,640
it is really a lack of political will to

772
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,120
build the right instruments

773
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,200
we all know we live in a geo-economic

774
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,520
world now where it's not only about

775
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,120
foreign and defence policy if we think

776
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,200
about external relations and impacting

777
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,960
regional or global developments

778
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
it's very much about the strategic use

779
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
of economic tools as well and others

780
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
turn them against us

781
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,440
now we have the single market as a huge

782
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,240
asset

783
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,799
we have the euro as a huge asset but

784
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,399
when we ask ourselves

785
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,360
is the euro punching above or below its

786
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,720
weight internationally

787
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,159
the answer is clearly below and why

788
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,159
because it has doesn't have the standing

789
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,000
of an international currency

790
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,120
now i just i'll close with that when

791
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,559
donald trump decided to leave the jcpoa

792
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,640
so the iran agreement we suddenly had

793
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,919
this discussion in

794
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,600
in berlin i you know i was sort of part

795
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
of it at the core

796
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,840
so what can we do what alternatives do

797
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,880
we have

798
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
to you know to um counter

799
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,159
the extraterritorial sanctions that the

800
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,840
u.s imposed at the time

801
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,679
and the quick answer was well we have to

802
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,760
use the euro we need a stronger role for

803
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,279
the euro

804
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,120
and then when it came to the discussion

805
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,520
why is the euro not where it should be

806
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,240
the simple answer is because the member

807
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,120
governments

808
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,919
never went as far as they should have to

809
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,159
internally consolidate the monetary

810
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,000
union by giving it a deep financial

811
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,880
market

812
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,640
by giving it the financial tools it

813
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
needs by completing banking union and by

814
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,960
seriously working on legitimate

815
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,480
governance mechanisms

816
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,440
so you know we can criticize the lack of

817
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,279
global power of the eu

818
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,760
but in order to work on it we have to

819
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,480
look

820
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,880
at the internal conditions within the

821
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
european union

822
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,679
and that's where the responsibility of

823
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,600
national governments is

824
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,440
thank you very much i think we've had uh

825
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,799
four very interesting

826
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:16,399
opening statements here i'd like to pick

827
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,000
up the pace a little bit with with your

828
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,960
questions

829
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,760
uh we we do have a few questions already

830
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,320
one

831
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
to the heart of what you were just

832
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,399
saying daniella which is

833
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,679
the the question of the eu's uh defense

834
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,880
capability and if that needs to be built

835
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,600
out really

836
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
before something substantial can happen

837
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,039
in terms of eu

838
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,240
power ivan korchok your country

839
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,159
is a member of nato um how do you see

840
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,440
this question i mean are we

841
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
are do we need to get to a point where

842
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:48,640
um

843
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,919
there there really is a a substantial

844
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,960
eu military force in some

845
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,519
in in some constellation for the eu to

846
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,440
exercise its power in addition to the

847
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,799
economic tools

848
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,960
uh through the euro and and other

849
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
measures

850
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,559
nato is in a good shape

851
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,279
i think it's it's fair to say and this

852
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,200
is my conclusion

853
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,919
from the meeting which i had a chance to

854
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,679
attend

855
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,480
two days ago

856
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,039
i have i have a good feeling from that

857
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,440
it's a recommitment to the very basic

858
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,880
role of nader which is collective

859
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,559
defense

860
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,480
we have an agreement that we have

861
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,919
embarked upon

862
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,120
a journey where we want to make it fit

863
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,720
for the 2030

864
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,840
challenges america is back president

865
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,120
biden was very

866
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,399
clear and outspoken on that so

867
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,880
nato is i think in a good shape in

868
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,960
addition

869
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,039
this is not very popular but over the

870
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,960
last four years

871
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
the the member states of nato have

872
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,240
increased the defense spending by 200

873
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,760
billion 200 billion more are we spending

874
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,799
as a nato

875
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,559
nations for our own defense

876
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,080
now the the eternal question about

877
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,159
defense and that ambition of european

878
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,440
union in that area

879
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,000
by score fine ambition fine

880
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,840
but the capability issue i think we are

881
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,399
lagging behind the ambition again

882
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:33,679
but still when it when it comes to what

883
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,960
we can project here

884
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,960
in this area it's question of political

885
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,799
will whether whether we are

886
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,320
able to go into common

887
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,279
operation operations in in our vicinity

888
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,559
i'm very much

889
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,440
uh curious what the european union which

890
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,240
was showing

891
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,600
in africa in in in sahel

892
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,120
uh region so this

893
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,840
is this is extremely important if we

894
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,440
really want to live up to

895
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,679
what we proclaim our our global

896
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,240
global ambition and more influence in

897
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,159
the area of foreign policy

898
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,640
let me go to uh mr schoenberg quickly

899
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,919
because you have an interesting

900
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,679
perspective i think coming from

901
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,399
again a neutral country i think it might

902
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,080
be good that you're not in nato actually

903
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,760
because of the austrian bundesliga i

904
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,640
think spends

905
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,120
less well less than no i i don't believe

906
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,720
i don't believe it's anything to do with

907
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
being non-aligned and neutral

908
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,000
um there are two points one is a

909
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
and and you said there's something very

910
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,399
important is the risk assessment

911
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,919
and i think it's a little bit old-school

912
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,679
to think now we need a european army and

913
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,960
this would be the the the

914
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,279
the safety we have in the future um if

915
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,360
we take the risk assessments nowadays

916
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:45,760
it's

917
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,519
about things like new technologies

918
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,279
artificial intelligence and these things

919
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:49,840
so

920
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,960
uh um or quantum mechanics

921
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,720
if we don't get our act together on that

922
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,159
it's no use to have an army

923
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,880
frankly uh so i believe we first we need

924
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,559
a risk risk assessment because otherwise

925
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,159
we do what we are great in europe

926
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,320
in europe we make a grand statement we

927
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,080
have great speeches we make

928
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,000
one step but without taking the second

929
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,918
step and we have something where we can

930
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,719
have an opening ceremony and nothing

931
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,359
follows

932
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,280
i believe uh um on on a defense policy

933
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,719
something and this has nothing to do

934
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,719
with neutrality again we never had an

935
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,239
issue with that and we said so when we

936
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,000
joined and we have five member states

937
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,599
being non-aligned it's not only austria

938
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,960
it's ireland malta

939
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,679
sweden and finland so um what about

940
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:30,639
pooling and sharing

941
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,800
why don't we have a common market in the

942
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,879
defense area we have tried

943
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,639
and it didn't fail because of the five

944
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,079
countries which are non-aligned it

945
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,119
failed of those

946
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,800
because of those countries who have a

947
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,159
defense industry

948
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,760
and where the pressure from the local

949
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
defense national defense industry

950
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,520
definitely not to buy with the neighbor

951
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,839
you know to buy the national product so

952
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,440
why don't we start with that but we're

953
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,480
good at

954
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,200
creating the rules implica applying the

955
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,960
rules of the common market in this area

956
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,320
that would be a first step and then we

957
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,920
can take the second one so instead of

958
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,440
having again a grand design

959
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,839
and and only doing it halfway as we did

960
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,280
in other areas like schengen for

961
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,720
instance we did the first step without

962
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,839
taking the second step

963
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,040
or the euro area um so i believe

964
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,680
let's make a risk assessment first see

965
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,320
where we need

966
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,640
to put our strengths together or pull

967
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,480
our forces and i believe that we might

968
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,240
end up saying it's not

969
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,880
you know the hardware and the army stuff

970
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,280
um

971
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,640
thank you very much i would like to go

972
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,480
to the questions in the room so please

973
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,839
prepare your questions and and while

974
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,119
you're thinking about them

975
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,880
uh i'd like to take one of the questions

976
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,240
from the globe sec

977
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,359
app which i think is right to the

978
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,760
uh wheelhouse of our our panelists up

979
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,200
here it has to do with the

980
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,480
western balkans and

981
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,200
um the the question is to what extent do

982
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,760
you feel the eu is making progress

983
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,440
in the western balkans in terms of

984
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,720
advancing the eu's geostrategic

985
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,680
uh objectives as said previously if

986
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,599
there is a place where the eu could make

987
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,720
its weight felt

988
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,280
uh it would be in the western balkans

989
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,760
maybe

990
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,359
start small uh i think um

991
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,880
even quachoke you probably have some

992
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,040
thoughts on this yes

993
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,440
no i mean the western balkans where else

994
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,320
if not there

995
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,720
and this is this is my doctrine my

996
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,640
thinking if you want

997
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,119
if you want to claim global ambition you

998
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,400
have to start in your

999
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,320
neighborhood in your vicinity so it's a

1000
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,000
must

1001
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,800
there we have to project our interest

1002
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,599
because they

1003
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,960
are they are indicated that they want to

1004
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,680
be

1005
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,200
members uh one day yet at the same time

1006
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,599
we see that that's still

1007
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,800
in the in the european union

1008
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,160
national interests are prevailing and

1009
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,760
we next week actually

1010
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,680
we can show in the council whether we

1011
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,200
can finally open

1012
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,160
or move forward the accession talks with

1013
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,119
two countries with

1014
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,599
albania and north north macedonia if not

1015
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,200
then we ourselves are putting our our

1016
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,079
enlargement policy which we believe is

1017
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,760
the main instrument of uh

1018
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,280
projecting stability in endowed in in

1019
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,960
question

1020
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,119
um everybody sees that there are

1021
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,960
competing powers which are

1022
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,200
projecting their interest in in the

1023
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,000
western

1024
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,440
balkans it's a it's a must for us but

1025
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,640
once again

1026
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,480
this is this is where we can basically

1027
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,680
measure that on the one hand we want to

1028
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:33,920
be

1029
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,720
player there on the other hand when it

1030
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,920
comes to such

1031
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,560
a fundamental issues like to reciprocate

1032
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,480
to the progress that north macedonia and

1033
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,520
albania have done

1034
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,440
we are not able to find a consensus

1035
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,640
because there is one

1036
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,040
national issue which i do respect i want

1037
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,839
to say i do respect that bulgaria has a

1038
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,359
national interest there but

1039
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,839
if you look at it from from a broader

1040
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,599
perspective

1041
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,520
it is a big problem for us and then i'm

1042
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,680
asking myself you know how can we

1043
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,040
expect that we will be will be more

1044
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,640
able on a big chess game

1045
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,680
when we are not able to to have a clear

1046
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,280
position in the in the western

1047
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,160
western balkans

1048
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,200
your politics is it's our it's not over

1049
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,320
our neighborhood it's our

1050
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,920
it's a european courtyard it's

1051
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,000
surrounded by you member states

1052
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,160
it's like our patio you know and we

1053
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
don't get the act together in our

1054
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,119
neighborhood then we should stop talking

1055
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,880
about the grand designs in geopolitics

1056
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,560
it's as simple as that sorry to be very

1057
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,920
frank

1058
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,880
citizens expect us to be able to project

1059
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,240
security and

1060
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,800
and uh commissioner johann once said

1061
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,240
very rightly either we are capable of

1062
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,079
projecting exporting security and

1063
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,119
stability or will

1064
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,800
end up importing instability and

1065
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,920
insecurity it's a very simple quotation

1066
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,800
and and um it's it's astonishing that we

1067
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,320
fail even in the closest neighborhood

1068
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,079
you mentioned belarus beforehand

1069
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,240
we have the ukraine we have moldova we

1070
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,160
have southern carcasses we have the

1071
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,640
northern uh the southern mediterranean

1072
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,000
and the whole western

1073
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
areas where we have to prove ourselves

1074
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,040
yeah

1075
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,720
i would like to go to a question in the

1076
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,079
room uh the

1077
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,280
woman here in the second row please

1078
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,960
state your name and your affiliation

1079
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,200
please

1080
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,440
i am a democratic activist from

1081
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,240
venezuela

1082
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,079
and for the last two years i've been the

1083
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,320
vice minister for foreign affairs

1084
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,119
of the constitutionally elected interim

1085
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,240
government

1086
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,800
i want to first thank vice minister

1087
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,960
marina sedeni because she has been

1088
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,960
a great champion for the venezuelan

1089
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,040
cause in italy

1090
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,160
but i am actually surprised and

1091
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,200
sad that i've been here for two days and

1092
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,760
nobody has mentioned the word latin

1093
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,720
america

1094
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,079
it's like we don't exist um and

1095
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,400
the you the eu we believe and we feel

1096
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,119
that sometimes have disconnects between

1097
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,359
brussels and the member states

1098
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,599
this connects between brussels and the

1099
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,760
eu parliament who has a more

1100
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,280
firm and clear view of what happens

1101
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,520
uh in venezuela and latin america

1102
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,359
because do you have a question though

1103
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,599
yes okay it's uh having a spillover

1104
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,839
effect over the rest of the region

1105
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:20,240
my question to you both in the room and

1106
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,319
to to all of you

1107
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,599
is don't take venezuela geographically

1108
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,160
or culturally because what you have

1109
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,040
experienced

1110
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,760
and the diagnosis that you have here

1111
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,680
from the real threat that we have in

1112
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,280
latin america

1113
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,520
is more important because it's based on

1114
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,520
values we're defending democracy and the

1115
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,560
threat comes

1116
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,880
from countries like russia like china

1117
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,160
like iran

1118
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,079
and it seems to me that you can take a

1119
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,440
greater stand

1120
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,839
defending these values in a region that

1121
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:51,680
it's actually close to europe

1122
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,319
thank you thank you very much let's try

1123
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,200
to make the uh

1124
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,599
answer briefer than the uh questions

1125
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,720
please uh maybe

1126
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,880
uh uh deputy foreign minister sereni

1127
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,920
would you like to take

1128
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,319
this question since you seem to have

1129
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,200
some expertise

1130
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,480
in latin america yeah i want

1131
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,240
i want to greet my friend isabella and

1132
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,359
yes i agree with her of course

1133
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,319
europe has to take in account the

1134
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,040
perception

1135
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,000
of our security and our uh main

1136
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,040
priorities

1137
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,079
uh in this area in this moment in the

1138
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,040
agenda is not

1139
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,079
late in america but at the same time

1140
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,839
as we want to be a global player we

1141
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,000
cannot

1142
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,480
forget the late in america because we

1143
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,280
have

1144
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,640
a very strong cultural economic

1145
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,520
and political relationships with that

1146
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,800
region

1147
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,760
particularly we have to be committed in

1148
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,319
a

1149
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,359
crisis a situation like that one

1150
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,079
in venezuela because there is we are

1151
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:54,880
facing

1152
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,079
a huge humanitarian crisis

1153
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,839
and we need to show together with other

1154
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:03,839
partners like mandid

1155
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,440
like a us of course we have to show that

1156
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,880
we are helping the opposition

1157
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,839
and the population not only on the

1158
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,839
humanitarian side but also on the

1159
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:17,359
political one

1160
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,640
and we are following as eu

1161
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,119
the process for the next elections in

1162
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,160
november

1163
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,839
uh you you know that there are some

1164
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,960
very small pieces of hopes

1165
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,000
that we can see in the dialogue we are

1166
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,560
following

1167
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,400
the norwegian activities of mediation

1168
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,440
and we are pushing for a real

1169
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,599
dialogue for all among the venezuelans

1170
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,760
with the guarantee of the international

1171
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,280
community

1172
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,880
we will participate next

1173
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,079
tomorrow to the donors conference

1174
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,200
about venezuela but it is not enough to

1175
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,000
be there

1176
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,200
with the humanitarian

1177
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,920
attitude we have also to have a

1178
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,440
political one

1179
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,280
minister serena i'd like to bring in the

1180
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,880
other panelists here alexander

1181
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,040
scherzberg you you had a a brief comment

1182
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,960
as did evan koch we only have 15 minutes

1183
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,520
left so

1184
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,040
only a very brief comment don't take it

1185
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,280
personally uh um probably other regions

1186
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,640
weren't mentioned as well

1187
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,800
but are you raise the point which i

1188
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,720
think is extremely important we haven't

1189
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,000
mentioned either yet

1190
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,079
um i believe one of the key issues is

1191
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,520
for the european foreign policy in the

1192
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,359
future it has to be a value-based

1193
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,200
foreign policy this is our strength this

1194
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,480
is our soft power

1195
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,160
and we have to acknowledge only 25

1196
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
percent of u.n member states

1197
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,920
are sharing the same model of life and

1198
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,200
if we talk about the western balkan

1199
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,560
springs oh venezuela

1200
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,280
it's a fight about what kind of model we

1201
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,280
want to export and i believe

1202
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,599
very strongly and personally our the

1203
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,800
things we fought

1204
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,359
for the things we built up in the last

1205
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,720
two and a half centuries actually in

1206
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,359
europe

1207
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,160
are universal of an universal value and

1208
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,760
we should fight for them so we need a

1209
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,440
value-based foreign policy we need to

1210
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,040
invest in those partnerships that are

1211
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,839
necessary

1212
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,920
like the transatlantic partnership like

1213
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,240
the uk let's forget about brexit let's

1214
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,079
move on with uk because it's a strong

1215
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,839
partner we need in the future

1216
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,079
and and on this respect you may raise an

1217
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:17,599
important point because it doesn't make

1218
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,280
a difference whether it's in venezuela

1219
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,720
whether it's in nepal

1220
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,560
or whether it's in southeastern asia or

1221
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,760
in hong kong

1222
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,520
i believe this is one a very strong

1223
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,880
point and thank you for for

1224
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,520
opening the possibility even just a

1225
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,319
technical remark

1226
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,160
have you have you noticed that one of

1227
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,560
the first decisions that i have made

1228
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,880
within the within the government for

1229
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,040
which i was severely criticized here

1230
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,839
in this country that we've recognized uh

1231
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,960
interim president

1232
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,560
uh guido and then more sarcastically i

1233
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,680
say

1234
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,800
i wish we had such a unified position as

1235
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,960
european union as we have on venezuela

1236
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,400
in other issues you know so

1237
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,680
i believe it's because we cannot

1238
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,839
influence entirely internal developments

1239
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,040
there but we've been dealing with

1240
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,240
venezuela quite

1241
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,359
extensively and the position is uh is

1242
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:10,240
very clear

1243
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,920
um towards that uh very good point sir

1244
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,480
thank you

1245
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,960
daniella uh you wanted to say something

1246
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,040
yes i'll be very short and it adds to

1247
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,160
uh what minister scheinbach just said so

1248
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,560
credibility starts at home and i think

1249
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:25,520
if you know

1250
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,800
if that is right what you said and i

1251
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,400
deeply buy into that we should have a

1252
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,240
values-based foreign policy

1253
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,599
we can see how our internal problems of

1254
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,800
actually protecting

1255
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,520
those western liberal values is harming

1256
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,760
our ability to project soft power

1257
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,280
and i guess the western barkers are one

1258
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,960
example where this may play out because

1259
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,720
there's competition there's competition

1260
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,560
there between two systems

1261
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,480
and we need to make sure that we

1262
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,800
maintain this credibility by ensuring

1263
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,640
that we do not see further democratic

1264
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,040
backsliding within the european union

1265
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,040
and the second that point of sense of

1266
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,400
urgency i wish to

1267
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,839
add is yes we have to focus

1268
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,480
on the regional crisis around the eu and

1269
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,160
on those countries who are waiting for

1270
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,760
our leadership to help them

1271
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,640
transition further yes however we cannot

1272
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,040
shy away from the very global dimension

1273
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,319
that was in your question

1274
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:15,839
and that that is the systemic

1275
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,839
competition piece

1276
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:20,240
and yes we have to rebuild transatlantic

1277
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,760
relations in that regard

1278
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,839
but my concern at the moment is that the

1279
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,079
eu and a number of member states and i

1280
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,839
include my own germany is too slow

1281
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:32,319
and actually seizing that momentum that

1282
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:33,280
is right now

1283
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,200
being offered by the united states under

1284
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,400
new leadership

1285
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,119
so if we want to do what you said i

1286
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,720
think we have to act on both accounts

1287
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,160
far more decidedly

1288
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,760
i believe you are completely right but i

1289
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,319
i have to say one thing a caution

1290
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,400
yes we have to remain credible but we

1291
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,319
should not we have to see the other side

1292
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,240
because we should not fall into the trap

1293
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,839
to buy in the narrative

1294
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,680
of other countries who for instance tell

1295
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,359
the child the the americans

1296
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,119
who tell president biden and secretary

1297
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,720
of state lincoln you don't have nothing

1298
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:01,680
to teach us

1299
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,280
because you have faults in the us as

1300
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,880
well on human rights so stop telling us

1301
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,319
what to do because that's an internal

1302
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,040
affair

1303
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,520
no so there is still a huge difference

1304
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,720
and a gap between

1305
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,400
our standards and the struggle we have

1306
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,160
internally within the european union

1307
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,560
and the fight we are we are having in in

1308
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,560
other countries and areas of this world

1309
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,839
and yes um i 100 agree with you

1310
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,920
um we have this and i believe it's the

1311
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,520
time is of the essence we have this

1312
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,680
chance now to really

1313
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,680
mend come together make the north

1314
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,839
atlantic if you want so more narrow

1315
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,000
and we should not mess it up with europe

1316
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,240
america needs us now and now

1317
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,839
watching what we're doing and if we're

1318
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,520
sending the right signal and we did

1319
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,960
already send a couple of right

1320
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,520
the wrong signals um then then we

1321
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,000
shouldn't

1322
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
you know be astonished if in a couple of

1323
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,920
years there will be payback time again

1324
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,599
and i believe from my perspective and we

1325
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,520
should stop please stop talking about

1326
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,200
the transatlantic relationship

1327
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,359
let's talk let's talk with americans

1328
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,640
about libya about

1329
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,280
the middle east about sub-saharan africa

1330
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,880
about concrete issues where we say what

1331
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,839
do we do together

1332
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,440
how do we proceed with sanctions what

1333
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:05,440
can we do on a regular level

1334
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,160
instead of talking like a partnership

1335
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,720
you know

1336
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,640
um how are you doing uh what should we

1337
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,319
do better shall we have an excursion

1338
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:12,960
together

1339
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,200
no this is not partner therapy we should

1340
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,160
act together

1341
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,400
um and no but sometimes sorry i'm very

1342
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,079
adamant and very emotional on this issue

1343
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:20,559
because

1344
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,559
it's a belief it's once in a lifetime

1345
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,920
and i have this feeling in the biden

1346
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,200
administration to see

1347
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,119
i've never seen an administration which

1348
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,040
has so much the wish

1349
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,599
and the will to work together with us

1350
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,720
and and here again

1351
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,559
neutrality has nothing to do with it

1352
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,480
it's values

1353
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,160
sorry to come back to this issue all the

1354
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,040
time but it's about values and and my

1355
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,119
policies i want my grandchildren to wake

1356
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,400
up in the in a

1357
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,839
society where they have freedom of

1358
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,440
speech freedom of assembly freedom of

1359
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,119
religion freedom of media

1360
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:50,960
and our partner in that the most

1361
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,880
important part now the us

1362
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,960
and we have to see this and i believe in

1363
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,000
the next 30 40 years it will be a really

1364
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,079
daunting and challenging struggle we

1365
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,760
will have ahead of us and i believe it's

1366
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,079
worth

1367
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,400
fighting for it thank you very much i

1368
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,200
would like to go to

1369
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,520
another question from the audience there

1370
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,200
was a gentleman here in the third row

1371
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,480
who had his hand up

1372
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:17,839
for a while and uh

1373
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,359
german council foreign relations in

1374
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,280
berlin but originally from glob second

1375
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,640
bratislava

1376
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,720
i want to ask about vetoes in eu foreign

1377
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,960
policy how can you reconcile it with the

1378
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,559
eu capacity to act that you mentioned

1379
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,079
daniela there is

1380
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:32,480
increasing nervousness in berlin with

1381
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,920
hungarian vetoes

1382
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,000
but what can actually be done about it

1383
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,119
what can new

1384
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,359
federal government germany be able to do

1385
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:40,319
if you

1386
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,920
won't change the treaties and second

1387
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
question to mr schallenberg if i may

1388
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,800
it's really a

1389
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,440
refreshment to see a more austrian

1390
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,480
participation

1391
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,599
at globsec um but your

1392
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,559
your chances i wasn't invited before i

1393
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,359
can tell you

1394
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,440
as i'm a veteran here that we always

1395
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,640
tried

1396
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,839
there was a change on austrian side

1397
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,599
which is welcome i wasn't interested

1398
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,280
there are two austrians on the panel now

1399
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,400
so you can't complain

1400
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,280
might include it but it's about values

1401
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,800
it's also about how you define your

1402
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,440
neighborhood

1403
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,200
and your partners in the eu and your

1404
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,720
chancellor yesterday was really

1405
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:13,760
brilliant

1406
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,839
very eloquent but he also slipped

1407
00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:17,040
something when he

1408
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,480
referred to central europe then he

1409
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,000
turned to his colleagues from czech

1410
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,440
republic slovakia and then said

1411
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,559
eastern europe so how can you reconcile

1412
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,040
your increased presence not only the

1413
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,640
globsec but in the region

1414
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,400
when you still use the old perceptions

1415
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,319
and call your partners eastern europeans

1416
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,000
when you travel 60 kilometers down the

1417
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,800
danube from vienna

1418
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,400
oh that's a provocative question

1419
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,559
i'll let you take that quickly okay uh

1420
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,160
um maybe maybe

1421
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,000
we we start considering ourselves as

1422
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,280
eastern europe we're east

1423
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,720
from prague actually no i i talk about

1424
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,880
uh central europe and actually it's

1425
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,079
funny that we don't have an

1426
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,599
expression actually for the other

1427
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:57,200
partners in the european union we

1428
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,640
continue that's a very dangerous thing

1429
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,480
it's another debate not to be

1430
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,280
conducted today is this group perception

1431
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,839
the club of 2004 and seven or whatever

1432
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,680
whatever the new member states which is

1433
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,960
ridiculous because they're not new

1434
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,240
anymore and yes we're investing in it

1435
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,319
heavily in this partnership because i

1436
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:15,760
think the one thing and

1437
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,599
and the pandemic was not only bad there

1438
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:19,359
were messages in there there were

1439
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,160
lessons we were taught like the urge of

1440
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,000
digitalization of the push

1441
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,520
in foreign policy that's another

1442
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,520
important issue and i hope that we won't

1443
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,800
you know get it all rid of uh once once

1444
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,160
the pandemic is fully over

1445
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,599
and the other one was neighborhood

1446
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,440
matters if you have a fire in your

1447
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,280
apartment you don't run to the guy on

1448
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,800
the other side of the city you run to

1449
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,440
the next

1450
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,280
door neighbor and that was the thing

1451
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,520
here and there's something i believe

1452
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,920
sorry it sounds romantic beautiful which

1453
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:46,960
has developed

1454
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,280
is that we had slavko we have central

1455
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,359
five we have all these formats and we

1456
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,520
always have so much to discuss about

1457
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:56,720
uh um so i wouldn't pin it down to words

1458
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,119
uh and for me it's it's clearly central

1459
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,559
to central europe and we consider

1460
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,000
ourselves as part of this this is a

1461
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,240
wider region starting somewhere in

1462
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,559
northern italy and switzerland and and

1463
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:07,280
moving

1464
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,920
at least until lemberg i would say um

1465
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,599
which is by the way closer to vienna

1466
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,119
that's the ukrainian border

1467
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,920
than foreign back just to play place

1468
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,119
your places

1469
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:19,119
politically but i believe the qmv

1470
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,440
question i believe we all could do was

1471
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,319
request to you will i take it yes please

1472
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,440
yeah

1473
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,680
so milan you know one one question is

1474
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,800
can we get it

1475
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,040
and you mentioned the german government

1476
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,359
which makes me slightly smile because

1477
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,240
germany helped the eu presidency uh last

1478
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:36,960
year

1479
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,920
and at some point qmv was on the agenda

1480
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,119
as an idea

1481
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,280
and you can blame many things on covet

1482
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,960
but not the fact that this didn't move

1483
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,680
forward

1484
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,440
so what i'm trying to say is you need

1485
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,680
unanimity to introduce

1486
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,839
qualified majority votes and if there's

1487
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,920
always one or two countries

1488
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,480
who do not you know want to go with the

1489
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,680
eu consensus

1490
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,079
there's a very small likelihood that

1491
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,520
this will actually happen

1492
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,920
you know right now i hear the discussion

1493
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,960
is and maybe

1494
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,359
ivan culture can say more on that to to

1495
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,480
start in some

1496
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,880
areas of foreign foreign affairs where

1497
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,760
it is less

1498
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,319
let me say less political less painful

1499
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:16,559
to be able to create the ability to move

1500
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,000
forward more quickly like maybe

1501
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,599
stabilization policy

1502
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,920
crisis support things like that

1503
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,200
humanitarian

1504
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,720
issues that would be a big step forward

1505
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,440
but for the geostrategic questions that

1506
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,160
we have

1507
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,040
been discussing here if we even had

1508
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,960
qualified majority vote and the council

1509
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,920
of ministers

1510
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,079
i believe the very contentious issues

1511
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,240
would move up to the european council

1512
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,880
where unanimity again plays

1513
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,359
so what i do believe is that the efforts

1514
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,359
that we have described in

1515
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:50,000
trying to frame the issues in this in a

1516
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,640
way that europeans can slowly but surely

1517
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,559
understand and not only the top-level

1518
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,319
political leadership but really

1519
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,680
the public debate can understand that we

1520
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,160
have a common interest to defend

1521
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,359
and a common shared model that we really

1522
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,839
work very well with to defend

1523
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,920
i think this is the base and then those

1524
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,480
more mechanical questions of

1525
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,119
change of voting rules can then come and

1526
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,640
while we have to do that

1527
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,400
i think we will see and i hope we will

1528
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,040
member states starting initiatives in

1529
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,000
smaller groups

1530
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,119
but ensuring the backing of at least a

1531
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,599
vast majority of european governments

1532
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,119
and then one final point which i think

1533
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,040
was already mentioned

1534
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,280
a tool that joseph burrell wants to

1535
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,079
employ

1536
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,640
increasingly is to have special envoys

1537
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,760
for certain

1538
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,760
issues and certain regions who can give

1539
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,079
a voice to the european union without of

1540
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,079
course at this point a formal vote

1541
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,760
but who can be and show a european

1542
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:50,799
presence

1543
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,760
in areas where the eu is not perceived

1544
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,520
as a major player

1545
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,040
so i think that's what we have to work

1546
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,559
on for the moment of course i would

1547
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,359
prefer

1548
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,760
a system where decisions go through

1549
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,680
smoothly and are then acceptable to

1550
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,280
those who are in the minority

1551
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,559
but i don't think we are there at the

1552
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,920
moment so we have to work with those

1553
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,119
other means and

1554
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,280
again national governments still have a

1555
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,280
huge responsibility in that system thank

1556
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,960
you very much daniela evan korchoki we

1557
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,079
wanted to make a brief comment

1558
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,119
on this before we get to yes

1559
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,400
it it slowly becomes

1560
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,520
yet another mantra the question qmv yes

1561
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:25,920
or no

1562
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,480
it slowly becomes yet another mantra of

1563
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,839
which we believe

1564
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:33,040
once we resolve it then we are saved

1565
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,920
that that will not happen exactly uh my

1566
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,440
problem is that i've

1567
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
been i spent too much time working

1568
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,040
within the eu and i'm asking the

1569
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,200
audience because there's so many experts

1570
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,000
what do we want to um what do we want to

1571
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,839
decide on by qmv within the council

1572
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:55,040
which does not legislate

1573
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,799
fsc is not adopting legislation

1574
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:02,240
in most cases there is maybe one area

1575
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,920
with the with the sanctions where we

1576
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,119
legislate

1577
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,040
but in other councils you know internal

1578
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,319
market

1579
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,160
the entire area of internal markets is

1580
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,960
qmv but it's legislation

1581
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,760
the way how we are trying to project our

1582
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,119
interest in foreign affairs

1583
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,520
it's not through legislation it's

1584
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,720
political positions

1585
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,400
in other council formations i don't want

1586
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,280
to bother you too much with that

1587
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,839
there is unanimity as well when adopting

1588
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:32,160
political uh political statements

1589
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,440
so i would be very cautious uh you know

1590
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,920
in trying to portray a situation then

1591
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,160
once we introduce qmv and i'm asking the

1592
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:40,799
audience

1593
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,079
qmv on what in foreign policy

1594
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,720
or middle east or or the arena would

1595
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,640
like to jump that's going to be more

1596
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:51,359
much much more uh complicated than it

1597
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:52,240
seems

1598
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,599
to become a solution to our inability to

1599
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,000
you know have a more more impact in in

1600
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,200
foreign policy

1601
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,960
thank you marina cerini i think you had

1602
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,119
a comment on this spoil the name

1603
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,839
yes with briefly a short comment because

1604
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:06,400
i

1605
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,440
agree the qualified majority voting

1606
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,160
should not be a mantra but we cannot

1607
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,920
avoid to have it

1608
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,880
in our discussion because we need a

1609
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,720
decision making process

1610
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,920
compatible with modern reaction

1611
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,440
and communication times we we are not

1612
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,640
legislating but if we have to to take a

1613
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,599
position

1614
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,040
we have to do it in a normal time

1615
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,760
uh with the communication time and the

1616
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,200
divide the debate

1617
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,680
on at the new level about qmv

1618
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,480
in common foreign policy should will be

1619
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,960
complicated and long

1620
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,119
we certainly need to proceed cautiously

1621
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,480
and win an incremental approach

1622
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,359
i agree with daniela it's not necessary

1623
00:57:57,359 --> 00:57:58,319
to have

1624
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,440
a decision immediately on this

1625
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,280
but we have to promote a process

1626
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,400
since we all know that

1627
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,960
those in some fields that are

1628
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,960
particularly sensitive

1629
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,160
we need to try to find

1630
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,520
the way ahead and i think we cannot

1631
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,160
avoid

1632
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,960
this discussion uh not deciding

1633
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,599
immediately but to have a process

1634
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,599
should we should i'm sorry sorry yeah

1635
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,040
should we have a couple minutes

1636
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,760
should we give a green light to starting

1637
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,440
negotiations with albania

1638
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,200
and macedonia via qmv

1639
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,960
well we can we can we can ask i did want

1640
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,400
to take one more but

1641
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,799
but but that's impossible uh at this

1642
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:44,480
moment because it's not a legislative

1643
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,119
decision

1644
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,119
minister political decision i think we

1645
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,240
have somebody who might have some very

1646
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,680
interesting thoughts on this one more

1647
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,319
question

1648
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,200
from to uh follow milan's advice and

1649
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,000
keep it in the

1650
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,500
in the habsburg lands

1651
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,359
[Laughter]

1652
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,720
carl schwarzenberg i believe you had a

1653
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,079
a question and maybe a a comment on some

1654
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,440
of these issues

1655
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,040
put an interesting question if our aims

1656
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:13,040
are too high but i asked myself

1657
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,839
considering the european union after all

1658
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,640
sometimes taking part in foreign policy

1659
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,839
in the european union do we have any

1660
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:24,880
aims in

1661
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,000
in european union do we have

1662
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,799
any clear aims in foreign policy i

1663
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,079
didn't recognize them

1664
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:33,920
during the whole years i was active in

1665
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,119
policy

1666
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:38,640
we don't have clear program have you

1667
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,599
from any commission or from this new

1668
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:42,400
invented

1669
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,160
office of foreign relations

1670
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,799
member of the commission had clear

1671
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:49,520
program

1672
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,760
what is our aim in the middle east what

1673
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,640
is our aim

1674
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,200
towards russia what is our aims towards

1675
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,480
the united states

1676
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,520
latin america and so on we have mild

1677
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:02,720
interest softly spoken nothing more

1678
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,760
we don't have any aims i mean

1679
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,480
it's not that i prefer the 19th century

1680
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:08,960
but

1681
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,160
there was mentioned venezuela in 19th

1682
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,040
century

1683
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,079
one country alone britain of france

1684
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:18,000
if they have a problem censor just

1685
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,119
briefly because you're running out of

1686
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:19,520
time

1687
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,480
and the interests were clearly defined

1688
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,680
nowadays

1689
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:26,319
we have two or three clear words and

1690
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,119
that's all

1691
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,880
thank you very much i think thank you

1692
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,640
sir thank you but first minister

1693
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,280
schoenberg

1694
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,319
uh just a quick comment very briefly um

1695
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,559
aim if you ask germany france what is

1696
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:38,319
your aim on russia what is the aim

1697
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,160
i believe if we go on them if we go on

1698
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,680
the meta level

1699
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,280
we have an aim and i believe that's what

1700
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,640
i tried to say at the very beginning

1701
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,480
that we are waking up we are sobering up

1702
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,040
we're becoming less naive in europe

1703
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,119
and my and for as far as i'm considered

1704
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,079
the aim is

1705
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:55,119
safeguard our values and and export them

1706
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,160
if possible

1707
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,799
but we are in the competition as far as

1708
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,880
our model of life is concerned and we

1709
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,880
are really realizing that this is a not

1710
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,799
kind surroundings we are not we would

1711
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,160
love to have only friends

1712
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,839
and we are figuring out now that we

1713
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,720
don't and that we have actually very few

1714
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,520
trusted valuable friends and this is a

1715
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,480
believe the aim

1716
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,559
what this means then when you put it on

1717
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:18,799
russia on belarus on the middle east on

1718
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:19,760
israel and so on

1719
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,440
that's something which might change from

1720
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,280
year to year changes to the situation

1721
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,119
but i believe i have that we have a very

1722
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,839
clear

1723
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,680
aim as far as values are concerned i

1724
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,680
would say at least i have

1725
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,240
100 agreement this is what i wanted to

1726
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,680
say very good i mean i mean no

1727
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,760
the the question whether we have aims in

1728
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,319
in foreign policy is legitimate but it's

1729
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:40,880
it's put narrowly because the

1730
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,440
overarching aim of european union is to

1731
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:44,319
protect

1732
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:47,599
the model of governance which now

1733
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,920
gets into competition globally i think

1734
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,280
that's the overarching it

1735
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,640
and foreign policy should just

1736
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,319
contribute to achieving that

1737
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,799
aim but that aim is clearly defined i

1738
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:58,000
think it's article two

1739
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,760
i don't know which one of the of the

1740
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,480
treaty but this is how to protect

1741
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,640
globally the model of governance which

1742
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,400
made us prosperous

1743
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,799
and safe for many many decades that's

1744
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,559
the slovak interest in european union

1745
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,160
that's a very good final word sir thank

1746
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:12,960
you very much

1747
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,280
thank you to all of the panelists for an

1748
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:16,319
engaging

1749
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,319

01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,920
