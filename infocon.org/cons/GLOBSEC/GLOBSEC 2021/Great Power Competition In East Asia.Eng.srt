so i will um you know before we get into

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,280
this discussion

48
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,799
which assumes that there is great power

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,560
competition i've had

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
some discussions with people outside of

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,320
the united states who say

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,479
there is no great power competition this

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,680
is a

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
framing invented by the americans to

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
justify opposition to china

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,439
to keep themselves relevant in the world

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,719
etc what do you make of that

58
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,119
well you you could make that argument uh

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,880
i think uh

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,639
the idea of great power competition is

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,479
is very popular outside the u.s actually

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,200
it's very popular in moscow for example

63
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,480
it seems to refer to the idea that

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
there are different polls of power in

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,879
fact when i listen to president biden

66
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,000
these days it seems

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,840
to me that he's abandoning a bit the

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,760
notion of great power competition he's

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
going back to an older notion of a

70
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,200
global liberal order

71
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,040
and the power is rooted in the global

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,640
liberal order the united states

73
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
stands as a kind of enforcer of that

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,000
order

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,519
but when we talked about great power

76
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,280
competition in in in the latest

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
administration and the strategy papers

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,000
that came out

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,680
the notion was that the global liberal

80
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,280
order had eroded

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,519
and we were a bit back in the jungle

82
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
with different polls of power

83
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,200
and a certain uncertainty about

84
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,959
the number of those powers we knew that

85
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,400
china the united states but then the

86
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
questions whether the european union was

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,040
part of it

88
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,959
questions whether india could could rise

89
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,159
to that position and

90
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,680
questions about whether russia had a

91
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,200
role to play in this great power

92
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
competition

93
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,239
but clearly to me the idea of great

94
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
power competition means

95
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
that each of these poles has its own

96
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,640
ideological model

97
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,959
each of these poles has its own center

98
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,959
of power

99
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,519
is self-sufficient in some sense and so

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,400
the question is

101
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,120
is this really the case or should we

102
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,239
still

103
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,959
think that something like a global order

104
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,239
still exists

105
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,440
and still provide stability uh and you

106
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,360
know for some people

107
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,000
uh it was it was just trump that didn't

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,519
believe in the global liberal order but

109
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,599
it's still solid and for others

110
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,440
that order no longer makes sense it's

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,640
impossible to enforce

112
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,239
how do we enforce something against

113
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,920
china and i guess that's the question

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,560
that

115
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
the by the administration will have to

116
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
answer how do we enforce something

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
against russia how do you enforce

118
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,760
something against

119
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,280
against china right now we see that

120
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,879
there's powers of enforcement being

121
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,159
quite weak

122
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,599
well this is actually related to our

123
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,280
poll question which is

124
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,040
what percentage of central and eastern

125
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,799
europeans is worried about china's

126
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
rising economic power

127
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,280
so if you have the globe sec app you can

128
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
respond to this poll

129
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,959
and we will read out the answers at the

130
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,080
end

131
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
um i want to go now to

132

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
and uh i i am living

146
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,479
just uh right in front of china

147
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,360
and uh i know that uh they are communist

148
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,400
uh

149
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,160
you know the ruling party is a communist

150
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,919
party and uh

151
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,120
you know in 1997 uh as you can see

152
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
what's what's what's going on at the

153
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,320
hong kong issue

154
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,440
or the human rights in wiggle or the

155
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,000
another issue about the you know ai like

156
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
i mean ai is it's actually that there is

157
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,520
a two meanings

158
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,880
for china one ai is an artificial island

159
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,840
the other ai is artificial intelligence

160
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,639
so they

161
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,000
so the uh lots of dimensions uh what we

162
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
have to discuss about

163
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,479
but uh unfortunately the uh the china

164
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,560
held the national people's congress in

165
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,120
march

166
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,360
and announced that the its difference

167
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,400
budget for

168
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,520
uh fiscal year 2021 was a

169
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,199
appropriate approximately u.s dollar to

170
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,960
202 billion uh represented uh growth

171
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,919
about a program is appropriate symmetry

172
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,680
6.8

173
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,039
uh compared to the previous fiscal year

174
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,160
so the the china uh even the

175
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
after corona uh they are increasing the

176
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,120
budget for the military and uh so

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,520
especially we are really concerned about

178
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,960
the

179
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,720
china between taiwan there is a

180
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
taiwan strike we have a concern about

181
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,680
the day before yesterday the chinese air

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,400
force

183
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,759
uh invaded uh to the taiwanese

184
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
uh territory territorial you know the

185
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,880
sky uh above taiwan so

186
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
those kind of uh uh very uh

187
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,000
uh naughty activity by chinese pla

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,280
uh towards taiwan it's now uh

189
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,080
increasing the numbers of the the time

190
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,479
so

191
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,560
uh and also uh when you focus to the uh

192
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,680
that's east town east east china sea

193
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,599
and south china sea uh i brought

194
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,840
like this uh photograph from the

195
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,520
satellite uh

196
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,479
this this uh this at shell island used

197
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,199
to be

198
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,639
just a leaf you know very

199
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,240
good it's a very natural reef

200
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,280
but within two three years

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,560
made a very very long runway with a

202
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,000
military base

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
so you can see more uh close to uh

204
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,720
four kilometers runway in

205
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
in this shell island so

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
the the lots of european countries uh

207
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
coming towards the uh south china sea

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,880
right now

209
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,919
and also the us military forces uh

210
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,199
concerned about the area uh

211
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,319
we are talking uh about and uh

212
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,800
today i'm really glad that uh joining

213
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,840
this forum but

214
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,039
this forum actually held in europe

215
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,840
and now that all now the people who

216
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
talking about this issue

217
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
is uh came from the united states

218
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
uh which we our allies and uh

219
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,000
i'd like to say and to mention that uh

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,120
the globe is a it's around and the

221
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,759
internet

222
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,440
also there is no border in this century

223
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,800
so we have to talk not just

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,199
not just the trans-trans-atlantic

225
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,160
relationship

226
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,800
but we also have to talk about the asia

227
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,360
issue

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,639
because that this taiwan strait issue

229
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,919
is going to be relate to the all whole

230
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,640
nations

231
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,200
so thank you very much thank you um a

232
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
lot to impact there that we're going to

233
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
come back to throughout this discussion

234
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
but right now i want to talk about you

235
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,320
know minister you mentioned this

236
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,240
military conflict but there's also

237
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,959
a a political conflict right or what

238
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,880
what kind of governance systems are we

239
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
going to live under

240
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,519
um troy you wrote a piece just

241
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,720
recently that basically said that um

242
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,560
you know countries that are standing up

243
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
to china and i apologize if i'm

244
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,240
summarizing it incorrectly you couldn't

245
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,600
you can push back but basically the

246
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,040
countries that are standing up to china

247
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,680
can

248
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,279
can do so democratically right can

249
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,279
bolster the democratic institutions

250
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,480
and that this will be an effective way

251
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,640
to counter china but

252
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
you know in the united states whether or

253
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,839
not you protect voting rights has become

254
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,360
a partisan issue

255
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,080
there are examples throughout europe of

256
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,640
uh

257
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,959
democratic backsliding or whatever

258
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,399
phrase you want to use to describe it so

259
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,440
my question is

260
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,080
how can these countries that are

261
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,200
democratic and are

262
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,959
standing up to china how can they say

263
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,640
they're doing that for democracy

264
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,399
when democracy is not being taken care

265
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,880
of at home

266
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
big question uh first emily thank you

267
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,880
for

268
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
for introducing this this panel it's

269
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,399
nice to be with everyone

270
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,120
here today albeit virtually uh emily i

271
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,080
think your framing

272
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,040
is right so if we take a step back and

273
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,120
look at how the bind administration

274
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
is crafting its early world view i would

275
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,959
say

276
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,519
to start it was interesting to me that

277
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,959
in the interim national security

278
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:03,519
guidance

279
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,680
there actually was no reference to great

280
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
power competition

281
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,959
i think there are a number of reasons

282
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,959
for that one is because

283
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,959
russia and china are not seen on the

284
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,440
same level of strategic competition

285
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
i think that makes sense but more

286
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,880
broadly

287
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,120
the the framing for this

288
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,640
administration's foreign policy agenda

289
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
is in a global competition

290
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,120
between authoritarian and democratic

291
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,920
states

292
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,079
china is clearly a central feature of

293
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,120
that

294
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,360
but another central feature of that is

295
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,279
that the united states seeks to rally

296
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
the world's democracies to take on

297
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,000
significant transnational challenges

298
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,120
whether that be

299
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,680
china climate change recovering from the

300
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,800
global pandemic

301
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,160
and i think that's what we saw the

302
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
president do on

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,240
this uh international trip to europe

304
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,839
which is just wrapping up he wants to

305
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,279
show that america is back

306
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,880
but that it is capable of rallying the

307
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,120
world's democracy democracies

308
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
so yes you bring up a key tension that

309
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,360
some of the world's strongest industrial

310
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,040
democracies are backsliding

311
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,680
internally on number of metrics i think

312
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,000
the administration recognizes that

313
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,839
and seeks to strengthen our internal

314
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,079
foundations

315
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,560
whether that be on voting rights uh but

316
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
also just presenting a strong democratic

317
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,760
model for the world

318
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
and this is going to be a big challenge

319
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,360
for the u.s europe

320
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
european and asian democracies to

321
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,880
present

322
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,680
a strong uh internal model so that we

323
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
can take on critical transnational

324
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,720
challenges together

325
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
um to close i think you bring up an

326
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,200
important tension but it is one that is

327
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
acknowledged in

328
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,880
um this administration's approach to its

329
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,000
european and its

330
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
asian democratic partners

331
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
thank you so much kanga i'd like to

332

336
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,760
are about the current state of great

337
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,000
power

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,240
competition thank you very much emily

democratic alternative uh has uh uh also

344
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,720
nicely uh um sums up or it was also

345
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
discussed during the g7

346
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,839
g7 summit uh recently uh where

347
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,760
where president biden also mentioned

348
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
that there needs

349
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,839
to be a new initiative and we also heard

350
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,519
in the past about the

351
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,120
d10 summit that is in the making

352
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,560
and we we will see what happens i think

353
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,000
the important of course the competition

354
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
is going on but but despite and

355
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
regardless the new initiatives

356
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,800
the most important part of it is that

357
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,720
they deliver and they bring

358
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,040
tangible results because we've seen many

359
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
initiatives

360
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,720
there's a community of democracies there

361
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,600
are different

362
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,760
institutions that uh their mission is to

363
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,920
some more support democracies um abroad

364
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,560
but if they don't deliver then the uh

365
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,079
the effects might be actually bring some

366
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,440
negative uh effects there was also an

367
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,480
initiative of

368
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
building back a better word that was

369
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,880
announced as well and

370
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,399
some people liked the slogan so much

371
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,360
they adopted it for themselves

372
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
exactly exactly so we will see but it's

373
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,839
a it's a great time it's a good momentum

374
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,959
and it's good to see

375
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,240
that america is back as well and

376
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
i think both uh america and the europe

377
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
needs each other to

378
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,959
to work on on issues even though they

379
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,120
don't agree

380
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,839
on on everything on on global powers

381
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,639
such as

382
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,120
such as china i have a follow-up which

383
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,480
is you know you just said america is

384
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,199
back

385
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,720
biden himself has repeatedly said

386
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,480
america is back um

387
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,920
but we still have a highly polarized

388
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,880
country we have midterms in 2022

389
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,600
presidential election 2024. um is there

390
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,480
a sense

391
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
in in europe particularly in this part

392
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
of europe that

393
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,360
okay baden's back he's saying the right

394
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
things but it could be reversed like

395
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,440
that

396
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,199
and in the meantime we've gotten

397
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,880
increasingly adversarial toward russia

398
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,160
into china

399
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,839
yeah i think you are right there is a

400
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,079
feeling that that america is back

401
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,199
but there is also understanding that is

402
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,199
this is not the same america that

403
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,519
we used to see but especially if we are

404
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,120
talking about this region

405
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,560
uh this region has never been

406
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,760
left america from its orbit for example

407
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,279
you we you mentioned our report we just

408
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,800
published a report on

409
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,360
strategic autonomy from central and

410
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,040
eastern

411
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,360
european view or perspectives it's it's

412
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,199
not a report that has a

413
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,040
country chapters but rather we brought

414
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,120
together outers from the region to

415
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,320
discuss the topic

416
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,199
and and this topic was was uh strategic

417
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,959
autonomy discussions in europe has

418
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:57,519
started

419
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,760
way before the uh pandemic

420
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,560
but the all the authors for example say

421
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,600
that

422
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,079
regardless we want or not the the

423
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,839
strategic autonomy of some sorts will

424
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,959
uh will be uh with us

425
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,120
in the medium or uh long term but of

426
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,279
course the devil lies in the details and

427
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,079
also what

428
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
every single author of this report said

429
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,680
that

430
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,079
yes central europe would not oppose it

431
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,880
but it

432
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,759
must not lead into the coupling and the

433
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,680
transatlantic bond is something that

434
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
that is important for this region and uh

435
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,839
and this is the the whole premise um

436
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,199
bruno a question for you

437
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,720
you know with great power competition

438
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,800
it's it's easy to see what this means

439
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,120
well maybe not easy but it's clearer or

440
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,959
easier to see what this means for the

441
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,480
united states for russia for china for

442
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,759
japan for india

443
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,519
um is there concern that for

444
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,079
smaller countries say in europe or

445
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,000
around the world that they

446
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,759
get left behind and lost in the shuffle

447
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,079
of between the great powers

448
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,000
it's a big concern for for lots of

449
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,079
medium-sized powers

450
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,720
i get that question all the time can a

451
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,600
country

452
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,040
uh afford not to choose you know

453
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,480
singapore would probably not like to be

454
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,519
forced to choose

455
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,600
necessarily in all dimensions between

456
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,199
china and the united states as

457
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,240
strong economic links um

458
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
there are other countries who who are

459
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,360
forced

460
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,759
in a way to to pick a side and that was

461
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,279
the story in the cold war i'm not sure

462
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,839
it's going to be the story here

463
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,680
i see opportunities for countries to

464
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,240
play both sides and some are trying that

465
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,040
when it comes to europe name names uh

466
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,920
sorry

467
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,240
well you know some very successful

468
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,040
countries

469
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,320
have developed close ties with china

470
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
even in europe switzerland is a good

471
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,360
case switzerland has a free trade

472
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,959
agreement with china and they seem to be

473
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,920
happy with it

474
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,160
um they don't have the same and you know

475
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
they have a history of neutrality that

476
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,360
allows them

477
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680
not to be necessarily forced to align

478
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,120
with the united states on everything

479
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,760
they can say no now the question is is

480
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,480
this going to be

481
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,119
in the end successful or not or in the

482
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,039
end they're going to be forced to choose

483
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,640
when it comes to europe i remember

484
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,839
meeting minister nakayam in 2015

485
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,880
and he was always insisting i think also

486
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,679
with other

487
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,919
european counterparts that europe has to

488
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,119
wake up

489
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,480
and the question which he referred to

490
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,880
today as well is you know the economic

491
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,640
links particularly between east asia and

492
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,840
europe

493
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,760
japan south korea taiwan

494
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,400
are they going to be controlled by china

495
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:36,960
in the end

496
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,320
are those trade routes going to be

497
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
controlled by china the ports the

498
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,520
massive ports that are being constructed

499
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,799
freedom of navigation

500
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,440
this is an issue where europe has to be

501
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,080
very very

502
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,000
active we cannot afford to become

503
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,120
a fortress isolated from the world

504
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,160
so the idea that in a way we have to be

505
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,280
present in asia

506
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,559
is becoming recognized in brussels

507
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,919
you have some european countries

508
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,840
developing indo-pacific strategies

509
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,000
you have the european commission having

510
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,880
two years ago

511
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,960
a big summit with the prime minister

512
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,480
chinzo abe

513
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,559
ideas to do the same with india so i

514
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,000
think i think minister nakayama was

515
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
right back then in 2015 this is an issue

516
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,120
also for europe

517
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,360
and we have to be present in in asia

518
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
well so i'd like to go now to minister

519
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,400
nakayama and ask

520
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
do you think that europe and the rest of

521
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
the world have woken up

522
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,200
um if so when did they wake up and why

523
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,440
and if not kind of what is it going to

524
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,679
take

525
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,840
so what the japan hopes now

526
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,280
to maintain and uh reinforce the vision

527
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,640
of voip is to further develop our

528
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,360
relationship

529
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,120
with the european union as a

530
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,080
strategic partner that we can act

531
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,360
together

532
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,679
with to establish world peace and

533
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,600
security and stability

534
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,200
based on common values such as democracy

535
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,120
and rule of law

536
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,799
and principles and uh you know we can

537
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,160
make a promise

538
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
and uh but the some country

539
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,360
uh sometimes uh

540
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,799
break the rules so

541
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,679
we are democratic countries uh have to

542
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,880
unite

543
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,480
and uh we need uh

544
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,840
add more friends to make a strong strong

545
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,039
strengthening

546
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,559
uh after against uh

547
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,240
the uh uh you know give the bad

548
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,880
influence to their uh neighboring

549
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,840
country

550
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,360
or even uh not neighboring country

551
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,000
because uh now the time uh you can

552
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,039
attack

553
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,720
uh even not geopolitically close

554
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,000
you can attack another country

555
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
through the internet or cyber attacks

556
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,799
so um our friends and the needs

557
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,559
is uh you know all over the world

558
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,600
so the bruno said uh

559
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,720
we have to wake up means uh we have to

560
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,840
wake up now

561
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,520
and when when 2015 i was a

562
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,320
state minister for foreign affairs and i

563
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,440
attended

564
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,000
all the cyber security conference held

565
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
out the europe held at the uh north

566
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,120
america

567
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,880
and uh i felt uh at that time

568
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,080
already uh i feel that the

569
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,600
new cold war exists in cyberspace

570
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,280
so that means russia and china

571
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,520
already collaborate collaborating on the

572
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,720
cyber

573
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,039
cyber world and united states and japan

574
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,320
uh is you know collaborating

575
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,360
and uh the internet field for china

576
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
chinese and the russians i think that

577
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,440
they wants to control

578
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,240
everything but for the united states and

579
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,120
japan

580
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,559
uh country like japan we want to use

581
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,240
internet field to emphasize the economy

582
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,120
to make more strong and free economy

583
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,320
so i hope the new president of the

584
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,360
united states

585
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,400
uh mr joe biden uh become

586
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,200
uh strong to make a strong leadership to

587
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,559
the democratic

588
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,760
uh nations and

589
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,240
to call upon the uh everybody get

590
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,280
together

591
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,640
to to how to say to to

592
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,120
to protect the uh democratic uh

593
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,799
world and uh not just the chasing

594
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,000
between the communist country

595
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,120
but also we have to

596
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,799
bring them uh bring them into the

597
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,919
uh the the stage

598
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,960
that we can talk more freely

599
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,240
and also talk more honestly

600
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,919
thank you thank you um i have one last

601
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,360
question that i'm going to put to tori

602
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
before opening it up to audience

603
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,960
questions again we have zoom questions

604
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,200
you can ask via the app and if you're

605
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,480
here with me in this room we have a

606
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,360
microphone

607
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,960
that you can get up to and ask we just

608
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
ask that you please not touch the mic

609
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,039
as we are still in a global pandemic um

610
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,200
tori my question for you you know so

611
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,640
we have this great power competition

612
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,640
right we're we're in this adversarial

613
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,080
relationship

614
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,320
on the other hand we have issues like

615
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
the global pandemic like climate change

616
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,440
um that we kind of can't address

617
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,360
if we aren't cooperating to some extent

618
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,799
so how do you how do we

619
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,440
balance the two right the reality that

620
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,400
there are these

621
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,080
um you know aggressive

622
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,200
autocratic uh countries that are on the

623
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,760
ascent

624
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,200
like um on the ascent and

625
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
on the other hand that there are

626
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,280
existential challenges that we need to

627
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,880
work out right it's a it's a great point

628
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,400
and i'll answer that by picking up on a

629
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
thread that

630
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,760
uh bruno raised um which is

631
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,400
in the united states asking allies or

632
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,159
partners to choose between the united

633
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,080
states and china it brings up this idea

634
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,720
of

635
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
decoupling that um i think was prominent

636
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,679
during the trump administration but

637
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,799
i'd like to debunk both of those uh

638
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,200
terms before moving on to your to your

639
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:25,919
question

640
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,840
one i don't think that the united states

641
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,679
uh under the obama administration nor

642
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:30,799
even under

643
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,600
um the trump administration really was

644
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,520
looking at decoupling

645
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,440
between the west and china the united

646
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,039
states and china as a viable

647
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,400
policy option it is clear that we

648
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
operate in an interconnected web of

649
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,799
technologies and economies and that that

650
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,360
is

651
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,679
not possible in today's world the second

652
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,360
idea of asking allies and partners to

653
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,919
choose

654
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,080
i also do not think is on the table in

655
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,679
the blind administration's foreign

656
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,520
policy agenda either

657
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
because the united states recognizes

658
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,559
that

659
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,840
many of its allies and partners in

660
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,760
europe and in asia rely

661
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
fundamentally on china's economy and

662
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,679
that if we asked allies and partners to

663
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,360
choose we may not like the answer

664
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,720
so i i think there is more complexity

665
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,840
to u.s foreign policy now than to put it

666
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,600
in terms of decoupling and

667
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,000
and asking allies and partners to choose

668
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,120
so i think that that's

669
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,640
an important thread to start from but

670
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,159
another reason that

671
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,080
these are not viable options is emily

672
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,520
because as you mentioned we're dealing

673
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,760
with transnational challenges that

674
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,400
will require cooperation between

675
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,720
democratic and authoritarian partners

676
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,039
and i think that we can look at the the

677
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,880
u.s russia summit that just

678
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,159
concluded to show that um this is

679
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,960
this is possible and that it is um

680
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,880
necessary you know we look at

681
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,200
uh nuclear issues for example being a

682
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,039
transnational challenge that we have to

683
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,159
deal with

684
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,840
the united states and russia i would say

685
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,760
are on a pretty adversarial footing at

686
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,640
the moment

687
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,200
yet uh presidents biden and putin

688
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,799
recognize that as the two world's

689
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,400
largest nuclear powers

690
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,000
we need to have a sense of stability in

691
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,919
this relationship to ensure that

692
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,240
uh peace remains that's one you know we

693
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,120
also have

694
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,039
our you know looking at the relationship

695
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,200
with china it's very clear that we are

696
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,360
going to need to cooperate with china on

697
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,679
big issues like climate change but also

698
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,480
on pandemic recovery addressing the next

699
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,559
pandemic should there ever be one

700
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,279
and that we need to keep uh channels of

701
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,880
dialogue and communication and

702
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,240
engagement open

703
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,000
so that we can deal with these big

704
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,360
transnational challenges like i

705
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,080
mentioned

706
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,039
nuclear issues climate change um

707
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,320
pandemics

708
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,000
this is going to require cooperation and

709
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,159
dialogue with authoritarian states with

710
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,320
peer competitors with adversaries

711
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,559
and i think that that's very much woven

712
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,520
into

713
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,279
the fabric and understanding of this

714
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,039
administration's outlook

715
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,760
right now okay so we have about half the

716
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,880
session left we're going to go to

717
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,840
questions now

718
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,039
um we have one from the app which

719
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,440
reads it's anonymous it reads is

720
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,880
military still the main area of

721
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,559
competition between great powers such as

722
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,120
china and the us or are geoeconomics and

723
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,000
technology

724
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,240
more important in that regard um kinga

725
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,279
because you just have this report on

726
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,559
strategic autonomy come

727
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,960
out i would like you to to take a stab

728
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,840
thank you very much

729
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,720
uh uh emily uh yeah i think it's

730
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,480
definitely the the second one

731
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,039
and uh we we were also discussing and

732
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,240
this is also

733
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,799
i will refer maybe to to the the the

734
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,760
argument that

735
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,320
if europe wakes up or not when it comes

736
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,760
to the global competition but

737
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,919
uh i think it definitely does of course

738
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:32,799
there is a

739
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,360
uh there is a division between those who

740
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,919
think that

741
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,880
europe uh is you know too slow does not

742
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,159
do enough but

743
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,919
on the other hand i i started just to

744
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,279
write down you know we

745
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,480
what you did in this regard and it's

746
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,520
it's not enough

747
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,600
we all know that member states national

748
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,360
interests are divided there's no

749
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
common position on china russia but

750
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,720
there are attempts from this

751
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,840
bureaucratic machine in in brazos

752
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,760
the we have a geopolitical commission

753
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,760
even it probably

754
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,159
expects sets expectations too high to

755
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,440
what it can deliver

756
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,360
but there is a global thinking about it

757
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,640
we have also the new

758
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,000
agenda for multilateralism when the eu

759
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
states that

760
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,720
that it will uh that this

761
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,799
pragmatic approach and cooperation and

762
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,399
approach to china

763
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,120
this is something that the eu is also

764
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,039
looking for and and member states are

765
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,640
actually reading for more

766
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,240
interest-driven eu

767
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
and also we member states are working on

768
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
the strategic compass also to

769
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,200
uh to bring the the positions closer or

770
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,840
that

771
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,880
analyze together different threats uh so

772
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,360
i definitely think that that europe has

773
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,000
has woke up to the geopolitical uh

774
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
uh challenges and is seeking for uh

775
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,039
its role on the global stage um

776
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,640
and um and uh yeah it's

777
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,039
it's just uh the time when that you will

778
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:57,919
will

779
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,799
arrive there um i know we have a zoom

780
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,360
question

781
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,279
so if the producers could could bring us

782
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,679
that query they're not ready yet with

783
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,520
the zoom question but that's fine um

784
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,880
okay does anyone in the room have a

785
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,159
question

786
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,440
okay we have another one from uh the app

787
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,640
which is uh it's a two-parter from

788
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
dimitri lokov of the martin center

789
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,360
one will the quad alliance us australia

790
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,039
india japan become more prominent in the

791
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:25,600
future

792
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,679
and then the second part is japan's view

793
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,520
does the eu recognize the importance of

794
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,279
southeast asia

795
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,320
so i'm going to have tori take the first

796
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,559
one and then we'll go to the minister so

797
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,200
tori um will the quad alliance become

798
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,320
more important in the future do you

799
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
think

800
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,159
short answer yes i think we're already

801
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,000
seeing the quad play a pretty prominent

802
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,480
role

803
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
in uh the u.s approach to the

804
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,600
indo-pacific currently

805
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
the fact that we had the first leaders

806
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,279
meeting of the quad early on in the

807
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,640
biden administration

808
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,960
i think is important i think it will

809
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,000
become an organizing

810
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,720
principle for dealing with challenges

811
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,200
from

812
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,080
china in the region but also um a more

813
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,840
positive and affirmative vision dealing

814
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,600
with vaccine distribution

815
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,200
um there is a i think a working group

816
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,919
for critical and emerging technologies

817
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,440
that is taking place within the quad

818
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,320
format

819
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,559
and uh yes absolutely i think that this

820
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,360
will be a

821
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,320
an important organizing principle for

822
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,000
u.s engagement in the region

823
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,200
i would be curious to hear from our

824
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
japanese counterparts whether he sees

825
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,120
um a a concrete real role for the eu

826
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,960
within or european partners within the

827
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
quad but on that i'd refer

828
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,000
to my colleague um so let's go now to to

829
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,640
minister

830
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,039
uh nakayama do you think that well first

831
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,720
of all does that you recognize the

832
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,320
importance of southeast asia

833
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,039
and can is there a role for the eu in

834
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,440
the quad

835
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,080
or um i think i i'm so sure that the uh

836
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,120
for example the this april this year

837
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,679
uh you know european union too has

838
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:00,240
announced

839
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,960
its strategy to cooperate in uh in in

840
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,440
the uh

841
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,880
in the pacific and uh also the uh

842
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,919
what what this strategy uh advocates

843
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,279
is exactly in harmony with what japan

844
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,240
promotes

845
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,360
in the foy vision uh in particular

846
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,399
as defense mini minister i highly

847
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,080
commend uh comment

848
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,760
on the point that the eu strategy

849
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,120
sets out uh the strengthening of uh

850
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,520
presence and action in the in the

851
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,799
pacific

852
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,600
on the related note we are seeing a

853
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,320
closer

854
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,880
collaboration with each of the european

855
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,080
nations

856
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,679
last month we conducted a

857
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,039
multi-racial exercise called arc 21

858
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,919
with france and united states and

859
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:51,120
australia

860
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,640
uh that involved training um

861
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,840
menus such as relation uh

862
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,919
rep repleni reprehension

863
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,120
at sea ras

864
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,240
and uh landing ashore uh

865
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,240
not only were we able to demonstrate

866
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,360
uh our resolution to protect our

867
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,120
our remote islands but we were

868
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,799
also able to show off our solid

869
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,519
collaboration between japan and france

870
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,120
and the indo-pacific

871
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,679
to our domestic and international

872
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,360
audience

873
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,200
ever as an effort not to lose

874
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,279
uh the moment a momentum of the exercise

875
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,679
each of the each of the chief of staff

876
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,120
from ground

877
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,919
maritime and heir staff officers of his

878
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:46,960
offices

879
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,720
engaged in vtcs with their france

880
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,600
counterparts and share views regarding

881
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
defense cooperation

882
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,399
going forward and also the united

883
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,159
kingdom kingdom uh

884
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,760
is going to send a queen el davis and so

885
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,320
uh

886
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,600
i think and also the germany too so the

887
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,600
all the european union countries

888
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,640
uh really focusing on uh

889
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,120
this region northeast asia and also the

890
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,679
south

891
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,799
south east asia but uh unfortunately

892
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,080
honestly speaking the

893
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,360
the taiwan issue is the i think the more

894
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,000
the most biggest issue and uh in the

895
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,279
pacific ocean

896
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,120
uh we have a honolulu and there is a

897
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,360
in the pacom of the united states

898
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,120
seventh street base

899
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,080
and i think the pacific ocean is very uh

900
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,120
big value and

901
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,320
asset uh for for not just the

902
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,279
asian country but also the indian ocean

903
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,240
countries and

904
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,919
even the europeans if you look up this

905
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,960
map this is a south china sea

906
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,000
and if the chinese submarine

907
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,880
launched the longest distance missile

908
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,760
towards

909
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,960
the north america it already reaches

910
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,240
to the white house and that means whole

911
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:08,960
the nation

912
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,399
including europe is already

913
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,200
inside of the range of the chinese uh

914
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,640
nuclear weapons it's a it's a

915
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,760
possibility

916
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,120
but uh we we have to unite and uh

917
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,399
uh this issue and the concern

918
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,519
uh we have to talk about uh like this

919
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,640
situation

920
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,360
and uh i don't know about the quad

921
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,159
future

922
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,440
uh but quad it's it's it's kind of like

923
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,120
examples of the how we make good friends

924
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,960
uh which we have a mutual uh profit

925
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,080
for the future and it will so thank you

926
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,440
very much

927
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,200
bruno i'd like to put the same questions

928
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,880
to you but from the european perspective

929
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,440
so

930
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,760
do you think that the eu recognizes uh

931
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,120
the importance of

932
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,720
southeast asia and what is the role for

933
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,240
europe with the quad yes it does

934
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,960
the high representative just came back

935
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,880
from indonesia

936
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,359
there was actually a very good reaction

937
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,159
lots of op-eds in the straits times and

938
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,359
other regional newspapers

939
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,639
the idea again is we have very strong

940
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,960
trade links and economic links but

941
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,639
that's not quite enough

942
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,520
they have to be protected politically

943
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,159
and

944
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,879
perhaps even militarily the issue you

945
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,480
asked this question earlier just a side

946
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,440
note

947
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,199
so far the competition has been mostly

948
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,040
economic and technological

949
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,239
but there's of course a question whether

950
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,199
chinese authorities decide to change the

951
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,079
nature of this competition at some point

952
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,000
by the way finding that competition in

953
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,440
the economic sphere is becoming very

954
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,879
difficult

955
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,320
and therefore then the question of

956
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,159
taiwan and other questions could

957
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,159
could be raised it's possible that china

958
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,359
would divert

959
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,040
great power competition to the military

960
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,560
sphere at some point

961
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,920
that could be the story for the next

962
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,640
decade and there i remain very skeptical

963
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,320
that the european union can do a lot

964
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,640
the question as it's usually posed in in

965
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
brussels in washington is

966
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,640
should europe have a military presence

967
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,760
in southeast asia

968
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,520
and south asia or should it focus on

969
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,880
europe therefore

970
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,880
freeing american resources to be more

971
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,560
focused on asia

972
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,599
i think that's a dialogue that's

973
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,040
happening between the united states and

974
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,880
europe

975
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
probably what's going to happen maybe

976
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,000
minister nakayama will

977
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,680
disagree but probably what's going to

978
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,280
happen is that europe is going to be

979
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,400
more focused on its eastern borders

980
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,079
european resources are going to be used

981
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,000
to face russia

982
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,880
and that u.s will slowly divert its

983
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,400
attention to

984
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,760
south asia southeast asia uh philippines

985
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,160
uh

986
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,440
let me just finish with one thought

987
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,599
maybe i you won't come back to me

988
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,440
uh it's been interesting this discussion

989
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,520
uh the question of values

990
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,119
because when you talk about great power

991
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,480
competition and during the trump

992
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,440
administration

993
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,480
it seemed to be uh the sort of

994
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,400
leaving behind the values question and

995
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,680
focusing on power

996
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,040
and that's very much a question that is

997
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,400
alive so far the bilingual

998
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,640
administration has really concentrated

999
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,280
its attention on the on democracies

1000
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,000
india japan south korea have deserved

1001
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,760
prime treatment from the administration

1002
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,800
but soon enough

1003
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,000
we're going to have a very serious

1004
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,359
question whether the united states is

1005
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,119
going to engage with vietnam

1006
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,240
is going to engage with the philippines

1007
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,800
in particular uh of course lots of of

1008
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
questions about duterte there

1009
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,000
uh thailand uh and then uh that raises

1010
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,880
the question of

1011
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,240
of whether uh values should be the main

1012
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,000
consideration or power should be the

1013
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,839
main consideration

1014
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,480
and i i i personally think that the

1015
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
united states will be forced sooner or

1016
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,119
later

1017
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,880
to be a bit more flexible in its

1018
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,640
approach if it wants to

1019
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,680
balance chinese power in asia

1020
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,040
so we have another question this one

1021
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,359
comes to us from jack dalrymple

1022
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:57,280
how successful do you think china's belt

1023
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,040
and road initiative has been and what do

1024
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,720
you think should be europe's response to

1025
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,920
these efforts to influence

1026
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,160
influence countries kanga i will go to

1027
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,599
you

1028
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,760
yeah i think we've just seen the the the

1029
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,200
response and and the

1030
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,960
uh g some g uh seven summit uh

1031
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,200
conclusions or recommendations that that

1032
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,720
the world is thinking about this

1033
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,520
question

1034
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,640
and uh and there is a actually

1035
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
uh really understanding that those

1036
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,680
alternatives

1037
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,800
must be delivered if uh the the word

1038
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,440
uh if democracies want to shape

1039
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,200
uh and influence uh the word uh

1040
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,320
as well so i think chinese were

1041
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,880
very smart in this in this approach with

1042
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
this initiative and

1043
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,480
from their perspective it is um it is

1044
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,680
successful uh what it's often also that

1045
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,280
this region is criticized for

1046
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,720
for the 16 now uh one plus one

1047
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,920
summit and uh it comes up in our report

1048
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,520
but also discussions that we have in the

1049
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,960
region as well is that the

1050
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,720
central and eastern european countries

1051
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,079
are more and more kind of

1052
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,880
disappointed with uh with the the

1053
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,280
chinese approach and they often we often

1054
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,800
say it's not 16 plus one but one plus 16

1055
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,040
because because the states

1056
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:19,920
are aware and and they cannot influence

1057
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,359
that match the agenda

1058
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:26,160
the format the setup so so uh

1059
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,720
it has been highly criticized but there

1060
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,480
is also a reflection in the region that

1061
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,079
this is not the format that

1062
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,440
for example uh brings that much

1063
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,200
to the region and we've seen lithuania

1064
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,680
leaving it so

1065
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,599
we will see what what happens and how

1066
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,880
also this is

1067
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,920
integrated on the eu level but

1068
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,880
we also know that other member states

1069
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
also have their different policies

1070
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,160
so i wouldn't hear it okay

1071
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,400
um we have another anonymous question

1072
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,599
this says

1073
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,000
economy resources and technology concern

1074
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,760
concerns strategic autonomy

1075
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,240
how to keep the autonomy economically um

1076
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,520
tory i'd like to go back to you because

1077
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,960
you spoke earlier about how we're not

1078
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,359
act

1079
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,200
we're not really going to decouple

1080
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,480
economically um

1081
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,599
what are your thoughts on this question

1082
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,359
how do you how do you remain

1083
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,079
economically

1084
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,760
autonomous in a great power world

1085
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,560
uh big question um and there are a

1086
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,920
couple things i'd like to pick up on

1087
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,119
from what bruno and

1088
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,960
and kanga have said as well but to

1089
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,839
address this issue

1090
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,320
um you know i think the the best way

1091
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,280
for european powers and for the european

1092
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,640
union to engage

1093
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,359
in what we might call a great game of

1094
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,119
great power competition however you want

1095
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,160
to phrase it

1096
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,480
is through its economic weight and its

1097
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,079
regulatory power we haven't really

1098
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,320
brought up this idea of regulatory power

1099
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,880
yet

1100
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,560
and this is where the european union and

1101
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,160
the european market

1102
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,599
have a tremendous amount of weight on

1103
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,200
the world stage and can

1104
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,320
influence how companies and powers

1105
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,079
engage at home in the world's

1106
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,800
largest market um so i think looking

1107
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,400
ahead we're going to see the european

1108
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,240
commission really lean into that its

1109
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,400
economic and its regulatory power

1110
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,720
to engage among great powers like the

1111
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,040
united states russia and china so that's

1112
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,160
one point um i want to go back to uh

1113
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,040
the question on bri and development

1114
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,680
because

1115
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,839
i completely agree with kenya that i

1116
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,599
think there's a lot of disappointment

1117
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,400
and disillusionment with what china is

1118
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,760
offering to

1119
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,920
both industrialized and developing

1120
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,839
countries in its um

1121
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,280
very lone heavy uh model and also

1122
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
just in the the disappointment around

1123
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,640
what china's been able to follow through

1124
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:36,880
on

1125
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,960
infrastructure-wise and so i think the

1126
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,079
time is right for

1127
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,000
industrialized democracies the united

1128
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
states europe other

1129
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,920
countries in the pacific like japan to

1130
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,440
really present viable

1131
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,720
alternatives to china's bri and honestly

1132
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,560
i don't think we're we're there yet

1133
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,640
i think you know the the european asian

1134
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,400
connectivity strategy

1135
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,240
the united states blue dot network

1136
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,599
initial development initiatives like

1137
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,400
this are not

1138
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,599
they don't have the political weight and

1139
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,599
the economic investment behind them to

1140
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,880
currently present

1141
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,640
uh viable alternatives and i really

1142
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,560
think we need to lean into

1143
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,680
uh the development angle of our

1144
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,520
soft power influence around the world so

1145
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
i think uh development is going to be

1146
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
critical to

1147
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,599
our ability to compete economically with

1148
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,200
key regions around the world

1149
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,240
now and going forward great so we have

1150
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,760
another question this one comes from a

1151
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,280
tough

1152
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,599
tathova it's a question for minister

1153
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:30,560
nakayama

1154
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,880
where do you see the future of eu japan

1155
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,040
cooperation what are the areas where it

1156
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,400
could be strengthened

1157
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,440
minister yes

1158
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,319
thank you very much for the question uh

1159
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,000
i'd like to say that

1160
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,200
you know the for example

1161
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,760
think about the chinese activities right

1162
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,560
now

1163
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,760
uh we are really concerned about uh

1164
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,640
unilateral attempts to change the status

1165
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,680
quo

1166
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,800
and uh but this kind of things

1167
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,400
not just happening on the earth but also

1168
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:04,800
the

1169
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,319
outer space so uh you know

1170
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,520
for example like uh the in the military

1171
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,319
field

1172
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,440
uh the big countries and uh the

1173
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,480
countries who get

1174
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,680
lots of budget for the armament they

1175
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,520
already created

1176
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,359
hgv missiles which is a very high speed

1177
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,480
long-range missiles and we cannot

1178
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,000
stop those kind of high-speed

1179
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,599
very aggressive massive

1180
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,440
attacks and if we want to stop

1181
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,160
those high technologies we have to

1182
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,200
create

1183
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,280
and uh pro we have to prepare the

1184
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,359
protection of the outer space

1185
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,000
but if you look up the sky and see the

1186
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,200
outer space

1187
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,599
we have a lot of already problem and the

1188
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,880
issues

1189
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,599
and uh you can see the uh lots of types

1190
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,280
of their space and that

1191
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,359
the chinese the space agency

1192
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:11,359
already launched lots of kira satellite

1193
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:14,640
and they launched satellite and

1194
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,520
after that they destroy their own

1195
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,480
satellite

1196
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,119
and make lots of state space their leads

1197
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:21,839
also

1198
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,079
you can see this graph and that really

1199
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:25,520
includes

1200
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,760
increasing the number of the space

1201
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,960
stabilities

1202
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,359
so why not the european countries

1203
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,319
and the japan and united states

1204
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,680
collaborating

1205
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,680
to protect of the the peace

1206
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,040
and stability of the outer space issues

1207
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,240
so we have a lot of capabilities and

1208
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,200
chances for the future between

1209
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,079
collaborating

1210
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,960
with european union european countries

1211
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,920
and also the united states of america

1212
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,880
thank you thank you um you came prepared

1213
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,240
you got maps you got charts you got

1214
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:02,800
graphs

1215
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,400
um we have a zoom question now so we

1216
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,520
will go to that

1217
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,200
good afternoon everyone my name is

1218
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,880
beatrice i'm from

1219
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,280
australia as part of the global voices

1220
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,079
program

1221
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,319
first of all thank you for such an

1222
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:19,760
informative discussion

1223
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,880
that we're having today my question is

1224
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,760
um you've mentioned communities of

1225
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,400
democracies and it's been mentioned

1226
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,359
a couple of times during this week my

1227
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,079
question is

1228
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,839
would the community of democracy survive

1229
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:36,079
another

1230
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,560
administration such as trump given the

1231
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,319
recent rise in popular

1232
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,680
populism that we've seen

1233
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,000
i am going to go to my fellow american

1234
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,839
to take beatrice's excellent question

1235
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,000
tori thank you beatrice it's a great

1236
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,880
question that means

1237
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,599
you asked uh president biden i think he

1238
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,720
would say that he

1239
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,680
ran on the very notion that american

1240
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,480
democracy

1241
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,720
was fledgling and that it wouldn't

1242
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,480
survive the second term of the trump

1243
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,839
administration

1244
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,480
um but but i think there's a broader

1245
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,040
point

1246
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,200
um to be addressed here in your question

1247
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,640
beatrice and that's

1248
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,880
that um democracies are challenged from

1249
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,280
within and from without

1250
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,880
i think during the trump administration

1251
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,040
there was this focus on

1252
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,680
um resurgent authoritarianism around the

1253
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,720
world and looking

1254
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,000
at challenges from russia china iran

1255
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,440
north korea is kind of an axis of

1256
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,800
authoritarian powers

1257
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,839
but there was no recognition um you know

1258
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,680
maybe for cynical reasons about

1259
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,240
uh declining democracy from within and i

1260
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,920
think that notion has been flipped on

1261
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:40,640
its head

1262
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,720
in this new administration we recognize

1263
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,920
that we have

1264
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,960
uh significant uh weaknesses within our

1265
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,920
own democracy

1266
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,760
not just in the united states but in our

1267
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,440
alliances and partnerships around the

1268
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,000
world

1269
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,480
and that we have to strengthen our

1270
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,000
democratic resilience

1271
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,599
in order to speak with a collective

1272
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,040
voice abroad

1273
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,359
um you know we have this summit for

1274
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,520
democracy taking place ostensibly in the

1275
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,319
next

1276
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,119
year or so at some point in 2022 i think

1277
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,040
that there are going to be a lot of

1278
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,359
issues addressed there uh first and

1279
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,200
foremost who goes

1280
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,839
um how do we count democracies as

1281
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,680
democracies i'm glad i'm not planning

1282
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,720
that because i think that would be a

1283
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,599
difficult

1284
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,319
issue to address but but i do think just

1285
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:24,720
to go back to your question that

1286
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,240
there is a recognition that our

1287
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,680
democracies have been weakened from

1288
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,560
within by

1289
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,640
forces of populism nationalism and that

1290
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,160
we need to recognize these

1291
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,119
internal weaknesses in order to compete

1292
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:35,760
with

1293
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,760
authoritarian powers abroad i think

1294
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,599
that's two sides of the coin

1295
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,839
that really need to be addressed if

1296
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,520
we're going to

1297
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,079
compete successfully with authoritarian

1298
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,240
powers whether that be russia china or

1299
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,000
others

1300
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,760
thank you so much yes we will see who's

1301
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,520
at who is at the summit and

1302
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,200
if as bruno suggested at some point

1303
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,960
the united states gets more flexible as

1304
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,040
to who's allowed in its democratic club

1305
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,560
i very quickly we have just a few

1306
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,920
minutes left but very quickly i'd like

1307
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,880
to put this question

1308
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,800
uh to the europeans do you think that

1309
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,839
this sort of um

1310
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,359
pro-democratic trans-atlantic stance

1311
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,920
against

1312
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,560
china and russia and great power and in

1313
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,079
our great power universe right we've

1314
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,200
learned that it's not just the world

1315
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,240
it's also in space

1316
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,640
um does that survive if if trump or

1317
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,839
someone like trump is back in 2024 very

1318
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,040
quickly

1319
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,400
can i disagree with the question of

1320
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,480
course yeah because i you know i think

1321
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:28,880
that's

1322
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,480
that's not really the main question for

1323
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,440
me the main question is

1324
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,640
the rise of china in particular and

1325
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
the way it's affecting the global system

1326
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:39,760
what we saw

1327
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,400
in the last two three years was a kind

1328
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,000
of

1329
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,960
failure of enforcing global norms

1330
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,040
on a scale that we hadn't seen before so

1331
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,720
remember when the hong kong protest

1332
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,280
started

1333
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,319
this educated opinion in in western

1334
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:59,359
uh media and and commentary it was there

1335
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:01,280
is no way that china can respond to this

1336
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,280
uh it lost control over hong kong and

1337
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,359
that's kind of the reaction we had 20 30

1338
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:06,160
years ago

1339
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,000
that an authoritarian state could not

1340
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,400
react to such uh widespread protests

1341
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,839
because you know the solution was

1342
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:14,000
to bring the military in right and that

1343
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,839
would have unintended consequences

1344
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,040
well i think you know we've been

1345
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,640
learning that things are a bit more

1346
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,760
complicated

1347
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,480
and that this power of enforcement

1348
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,240
coming from global democracies is much

1349
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,599
weakened

1350
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,920
china was able to control the descent in

1351
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,720
hong kong

1352
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,359
we see in belarus even more shocking

1353
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,280
that a small country like belarus was

1354
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,440
able to put an end to the protests

1355
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,359
and so really for me the question and

1356
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,280
i'm sorry to say this it might not sound

1357
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:39,920
popular

1358
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,480
it's actually a question of power

1359
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,839
distribution

1360
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,960
and the way we have to

1361
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,520
martial news sources of power find new

1362
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,319
allies

1363
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,200
uh if we want to have a a stable global

1364
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,319
balance of power

1365
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,000
because what's happening it seems clear

1366
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,079
to me is that countries like china like

1367
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,760
russia are testing the limits and

1368
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,319
becoming

1369
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:02,640
increasingly confident that there are no

1370
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,559
consequences to a number of actions

1371
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,520
navalny is another great example um so

1372
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,599
every month uh or every couple of months

1373
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,319
we see

1374
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,359
how this global order is eroding further

1375
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,000
and further

1376
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,760
well on that optimistic note let's just

1377
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,119
very quickly check in with our poll

1378
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,520

producers can we see the full there we

1380
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,119

1385
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:32,640
rising economic power

1386
