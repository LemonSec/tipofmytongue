as possible the session will last one

30
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,240
hour

31
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,840
we will get questions towards the end of

32
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,919
it and

33
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,958
without further ado

34
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,519
the policy response to the pandemic has

35
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,599
been hardly debated across all the

36
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,719
european union and

37
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,560
in the european capital since spring

38
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,720
last year a shared solution materialized

39
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,399
into a rescue package

40
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,040
five times larger than the marshall plan

41
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,880
with the aim of providing relief

42
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
and increasing eu economies resilience

43
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,760
how will it work how are we going to get

44
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,519
there and how we are going to

45
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,600
jump start the economies of the eu

46
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
member states and consequently

47
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,760
the economy of the bloc this is what

48
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,200
we're going to discuss with our speakers

49
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200

thank you so much for being here it's a

60
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
great pleasure to have you all here for

61
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,560
this session as we are discussing of

62
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,920
course some of the most important

63
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,440
economic issues when we're looking at

64
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
the future of the european union and of

65
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,760
the member

66
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,320
states and let me start with the asking

67
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,959
you

68
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,640
on the recovery and resilience facility

69
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,399
of course there's been so much debate

70
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,080
over it and do you think

71
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
chancellor let's start with you do you

72
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,839
think it will be enough to jump start

73
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,959
this recovery and the economies

74
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,480
well first of all thank you very much

75
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
for inviting me to the globsec

76
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,160
conference

77
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,120
um and to answer your question yes i i

78
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,200
think that it will be enough

79
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
and i would also say it has to be enough

80
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
you know that

81
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
austria and some other countries in the

82
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,440
european union

83
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,839
the so-called frugal countries were

84
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,600
quite skeptical at the

85
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,279
about the recovery fund at the beginning

86
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,279
we agreed in the end because we think

87
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,120
that the package is good

88
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
um we think that this decision was good

89
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,680
and we think that it was necessary

90
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
um to invest a lot of money to to kick

91
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
start the economy but

92
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,600
we would have not agreed to a permanent

93
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,000
debt

94
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,839
union and we do not

95
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959
want to repeat it several times we

96
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,079
think that it was a tool necessary

97
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,120
at this time but nothing we should

98
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,079
repeat

99
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,360
um quite often and so

100
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,560
i think it is not only enough it has to

101
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,680
be enough

102
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,560
and i think it should also it would also

103
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,839
be good to remember

104
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,880
ourselves why we are talking about the

105
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,279
need to kick-start our economy

106
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,360
the reason for the um economic

107
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,279
um um uh or for the negative

108
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,720
development of our economies we had is

109
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,440
uh the pandemic and most people here are

110
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,720
still wearing masks

111
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,279
we still have some rules necessary rules

112
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,560
at the moment

113
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,240
but in austria for example we have more

114
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,480
than 50 percent of our people vaccinated

115
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,279
so far

116
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,360
um at the beginning of summer we will

117
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,800
have more than 50

118
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
vaccinated in all eu member states by

119
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,920
the

120
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,160
end of summer we will have two thirds or

121
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,480
70 or 75 percent

122
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,560
vaccinated in most european member

123
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
states so i think

124
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,279
there's a good chance that we win

125
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,639
against the pandemic

126
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,760
and that we can go back to a normal

127
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,399
situation and this is the best support

128
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,760
for our economy

129
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,240
and so my answer would be yes i think it

130
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,839
is more than enough

131
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,760
it's okay that we did it but it is more

132
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,440
than enough and now we should not

133
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,320
discuss

134
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,440
if we need more we should focus more on

135
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,320
the debate

136
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
where to invest because i think it's not

137
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,639
only important how much we invest

138
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,120
it's even more important where we

139
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,760
invested

140
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,120
now you just mentioned some of that

141
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,959
skepticism that the frugal countries had

142
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,480
in the beginning with the conversations

143
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,000
and some really heated debates

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,279
would you say that now there is less

145
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,160
skepticism yes there is less

146
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,240
skepticism because we agreed on numbers

147
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
we agreed on a wider package including

148
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,200
rule of law and other criterias

149
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,079
um we agreed that there should be a main

150
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,200
focus

151
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,320
on investment in digitalization and

152
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,680
also um in in in green

153
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,959
uh economy which makes our economies

154
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,279
more resilient and

155
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,000
also more powerful uh and last but not

156
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,720
least

157
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
we also agreed that it is a single tool

158
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
uh and that it is not a permanent debt

159
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
union which was for us the most

160
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,480
important point

161
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
thank you so much uh prime minister

162
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,519
hagar what's your take on that would

163
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,000
that be

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,320
enough and what are some of the

165
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
cornerstones of national strategies in

166
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,000
your case

167
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,320
well first of all i think it's uh

168
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,360
important to

169
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,320
look at the time when it was agreed it

170
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,040
wasn't

171
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,560
easy that this proposal uh was born

172
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,639
uh because of the discussion we had and

173
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,480
there was a lot of question marks on the

174
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,040
risks

175
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,480
of this uh whole action but yes we are

176
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,040
here

177
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,839
it's been uh decided it's been agreed

178
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,120
that's important

179
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,399
but i think we have to think of a strong

180
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,199
element of this whole package and the

181
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,639
the element is the

182
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,320
uh focus on reforms because that was

183
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
the condition of the uh responsible

184
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
countries as i would say

185
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,600
we said okay if we want to uh invest a

186
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,480
lot of money

187
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
out of the government pockets and

188
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,839
increase the debt

189
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,040
we have to have the investments into

190
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,079
or linked with the reforms so because we

191
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,760
know the reforms are the ones that bring

192
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
the healthy public

193
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,480
finances so that must be going hand in

194
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,240
hand in order to prevent

195
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,360
a further growth of the debt rather uh

196
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,680
having instruments where the debt could

197
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,399
later on

198
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,839
be decreased by uh helping the economies

199
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,880
to grow

200
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,519
so and therefore the pension reform tax

201
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,320
reform

202
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,800
uh education reforms and it depends from

203
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,079
country to country

204
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,160
but the element of reforms must be

205
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
discussed i think every time we speak

206
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,000
about this package of the money because

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,639
if we don't conduct the reforms

208
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,880
we invest the money but it won't have

209
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,240
such uh

210
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,040
such impact as it should be and as i

211
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,760
said

212
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,160
uh the milestones in the recovery plans

213
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,240
are based on the fact that in the first

214
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,279
couple years

215
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,399
should be developed or conducted the

216
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,199
reforms

217
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,279
and we know that the investments take a

218
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,240
longer time

219
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
when we speak on the investments i fully

220
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,880
agree it's very important to

221
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,959
speak where to invest this is one time

222
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,839
great activity first time in the history

223
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,759
of eu where we take such a debt where we

224
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,240
take

225
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,360
actually that together uh in in this way

226
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,720
so we have to be very wise but it's

227
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,880
only a kind of the beginning because we

228
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
know also from the part of slovakia

229
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,519
that our recovery plan doesn't include

230
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,399
everything

231
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,440
and we have to do a lot of uh

232
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,199
changes in in the regulations

233
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,360
and allow the business environment to

234
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,320
grow

235
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,040
and what's important what happened also

236
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,320
during this year

237
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
there was a and last year there was a

238
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,600
massive help

239
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,240
of the economies that's not really part

240
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,680
of the recovery plan

241
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
where we invested a lot of money and

242
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,519
increased the depth of our countries

243
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,320
to to help the the environment business

244
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,920
environment to survive

245
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,000
and that was very important so this goes

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,959
hand in hand

247
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,320
and we have to see it as the whole

248
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
package thank you deputy prime minister

249
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,480
well first of all thank you very much uh

250
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,639
it's very pleasure for me to me that you

251
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,120
is an honor for me and congratulations

252
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
to the football team of austria and

253
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,040
slovakia and czech republic because all

254
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,630
of these teams they won as you know

255
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,279
[Applause]

256
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,880
well but from the point of view of

257
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,480
recovery and resilience

258
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,279
facility so from the point of view of

259
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,560
the czech republic

260
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,680
it will not be the only instrument

261
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,120
but it could be the key instrument

262
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,079
definitely what are the priorities or or

263
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:58,800
let's say the

264
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,279
main vehicles in the czech republic the

265
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,199
fresh this is a

266
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,480
industry efficiency we are medium-sized

267
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,199
country

268
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,439
and it's not about amount it's not about

269
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,359
revenues about turnover because i came

270
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,280
from business from small and medium

271
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,119
sized business i i know that

272
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,039
medium-sized business it's

273
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,679
based on efficiency not on the turnover

274
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,959
on the revenues

275
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,760
and to achieve the uh for efficiency

276
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
that means that we have to invest and to

277
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,480
do innovation

278
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,640
into the research to the development

279
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
into the science and you can expect a

280
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,600
few

281
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,080
years uh we can expect that we will be

282
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,640
aided

283
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,120
value uh oriented economy this is the

284
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,679
first

285
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,080
sms activity as a small and medium

286
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,440
enterprises

287
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,760
we are the smes country and as i know

288
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,280
your countries they are also based on

289
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,360
the small and medium enterprises

290
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
and 99 percent of all the companies they

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,160
are active as a small and medium

292
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
companies it's extremely important from

293
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,320
the point of view of regional activities

294
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,520
services and

295
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
let's say the niche marketing is a very

296
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,559
flexible

297
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,080
environment which you have to prepare

298
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,480
for small small companies

299
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,919
startup and spin-offs for creativity

300
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,919
we need young people they are starting

301
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,039
their business

302
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,120
we need of new technologies we need

303
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,760
for let's say the new companies uh they

304
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,400
are

305
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,039
starting uh the business at the regional

306
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:21,919
regional

307
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,440
uh levels and of course we need uh

308
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,000
unbureaucratic uh

309
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
public sectors and it's important to say

310
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,679
that even

311
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,600
before the crisis the czech republic we

312
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,720
defined

313
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,960
uh the new priorities we completely

314
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,480
changed the priorities at the level of

315
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,320
czech republic and we start

316
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,960
to invest into the research development

317
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,160
and we have

318
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
introduced the so-called innovation

319
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
strategy which is called the czech

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,320
republic country for the future

321
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,760
and that's from our point of view

322
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,120
the key step because

323
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,480
it includes the new system of financing

324
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,960
and

325
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,400
evaluation of the research and

326
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,320
development new system of the

327
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,000
digitization of

328
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
the czech republic

329
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,520
we are creating the environment for

330
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,120
startups and and

331
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,240
pin-offs uh starting to uh to

332
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,440
support smart investments

333
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,679
and so on and also we are promoting

334
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,679
the new brand of the czech republic no

335
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,160
more length of stories but

336
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
as a country for the future we would

337
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,960
like to present the czech republic and

338
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
promote the czech republic

339
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
no more as a country of the chi beer as

340
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,160
a beautiful

341
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,000
country site and the charles bridge that

342
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,600
is a country of the knowledge is

343
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,120
innovation uh science and university and

344
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,840
uh for recovery and tourism resilience

345
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,400
plan

346
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,039
uh is based on this innovation strategy

347
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,640
and the question if it's enough

348
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
from our point of view the amount it's

349
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
enough so there's also a moment to

350
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
to change and innovate and to come up

351
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,480
with the new ideas now after this year

352
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,200
of course

353
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,400
now all the three countries have

354
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,919
submitted their plans and all of them

355
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,520
are based on the eu guidance of course

356
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,200
when it comes to green ambitions when it

357
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
comes to digitalization

358
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,280
but at the same time when it comes to

359
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,799
the eu funds they're of course

360
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,760
tied to the issue of conditionality and

361
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,520
some structural reforms

362
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
for many many people in europe once you

363
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,000
hear structural reforms

364
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,559
you think of some very strict control at

365
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
the same time that's of course some

366
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,360
memories that we have from the financial

367
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
crisis now where is this balance in

368
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,480
terms of how to

369
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
uh try to make sure that the funds are

370
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,919
of course used with the

371
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,000
respect to the eu guidance with the

372
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
national strategies respecting the needs

373
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,159
of every eu member but also

374
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,440
not to overdo this control over

375
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
structural reforms not to bring back

376
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,919
something that would even slightly

377
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,440
remind anybody of

378
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,840
the troika strategy

379
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,520
well if you allowed yes me to start i

380
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,799
i would say a bit more control

381
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,159
would not be wrong so

382
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,360
i don't i don't think that uh uh we

383
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,480
should fear too much

384
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,840
control uh and uh i think uh

385
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,960
the troika was not uh only negative at

386
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,520
all because without structural reforms

387
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,159
um

388
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,360
all these uh new money will

389
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,400
will not um will not fly so i

390
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,120
i i think uh and this was also one of

391
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,720
the points we criticized as

392
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,280
the frugal countries was that we

393
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,760
discussed

394
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,880
far too long um about the numbers

395
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,039
uh and how much to invest and we

396
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,919
discussed

397
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,880
too little how to invest where to invest

398
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,200
and

399
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,280
how to control it so from our point of

400
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,400
view um

401
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,840
control is not bad uh it's necessary uh

402
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,280
um if you invest 700 billion euros

403
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
uh in a very short period of time i

404
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,720
think it's important

405
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,000
to decide where and to control that

406
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,760
i think the the goal from the european

407
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,720
union that at least one third should be

408
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,799
invested in uh green transition and at

409
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,159
least 20

410
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,280
in innovation uh and digitalization

411
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,919
is not that high for example in austria

412
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,159
um if you combine these two uh

413
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,720
areas we have more than 90 percent or

414
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,240
about 90 percent

415
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,360
invested uh in in green transition and

416
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,000
in

417
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,120
digitalization so it is doable and i

418
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,679
think that

419
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,240
on the long run the countries will

420
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,880
profit

421
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,240
if they do it and last point because the

422
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,760
prime minister mentioned it

423
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,799
i think structural reforms are the basis

424
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,760
if you look at the unemployment rate for

425
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,559
example

426
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,720
in the different member states it's

427
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,919
extremely low

428
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,120
in czech republic and it's much higher

429
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,840
uh in in countries like portugal spain

430
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,720
and others so

431
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,080
uh i think um

432
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,480
if if if we don't focus on these

433
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
structural problems as well

434
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,720
um we will lose competitiveness within

435
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,520
the eu and

436
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,840
competitiveness is the basis for

437
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,559
economic

438
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:05,840
um uh recovery uh and

439
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
positive development of the european

440
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,840
union and for the recovery and then

441
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,520
afterwards for the growth stage for the

442
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
economy prime minister what's your take

443
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
on when it on the on the issue of

444
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
conditionality and structural reforms

445
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
and control over those yeah of course

446
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,919
it's very needed and that's why the

447
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,520
whole plan was

448
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,039
called it's good plan it's not a

449
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,120
strategy actually all the countries had

450
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,400
to develop a

451
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
very detailed plan we never experienced

452
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
this with the structural funds

453
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
it was a new exercise for all the

454
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,679
countries and i think it was very good

455
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,039
exercise

456
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,320
even though we didn't have that much

457
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,720
time but i think the countries knew

458
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,559
their own problems and they saw what

459
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:41,200
came with the

460
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,400
with the panda me but uh if you lay down

461
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,039
a plan

462
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,720
and you know what you want to do the

463
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,120
next six years five six years

464
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
where you want to invest because that's

465
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,720
what you needed to submit by the end of

466
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,679
april

467
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,320
so uh and and the european commission

468
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
said very clearly

469
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,279
you need to have milestones and we'll

470
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,360
see whether you meet the milestones and

471
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,679
based on meeting the milestones we will

472
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,200
release the money

473
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,000
beautiful that's a motivation it has uh

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,240
it

475
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,440
uh it's the journey so i think for

476
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,799
for countries who didn't have this

477
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,279
experience uh it was a great exercise

478
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,000
for them

479
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,200
to prepare and therefore uh i fully

480
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,679
agree

481
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,840
the control is needed because otherwise

482
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,440
the money will be just spent

483
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
and there will be a disaster such a

484
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,400
money you don't want to just spend you

485
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,760
want to invest them

486
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,640
because the debt grew in the eu by

487
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,320
average up to 100

488
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,679
of gdp and and that's not a low number

489
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,919
so uh and if we don't want to be a

490
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,880
continent where

491
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,600
we don't uh we have to i think we have

492
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,039
to be responsible toward the depth

493
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,600
always

494
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,679
because we have different economies etc

495
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,080
so so that therefore you need to

496
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,880
have very wise investments and i know

497
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,640
that the commission did a very good job

498
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,279
on

499
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:57,520
communicating with all the countries uh

500
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,720
about explaining where the investment go

501
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,360
whether these investments are really the

502
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,760
good

503
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,360
good mate and uh therefore i have a

504
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,360
strong uh or strong hope that this is

505
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,080
gonna bring

506
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,559
good results if it's going to conduct it

507
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,559
and by having the milestones

508
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,960
there in the plan and the condition of

509
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,559
releasing the money only by achieving

510
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,760
the milestones i think it's going to be

511
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,880
a successful

512
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,360
exercise and it's going to move europe

513
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,919
uh

514
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,720
stronger and that's what we need this

515
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,400
continent needs to be very strong

516
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,080
continent needs to be competitive

517
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,279
with the world uh and and we know that

518
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:35,840
europe

519
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,840
is a rather difficult continent because

520
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,279
there's so many countries

521
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,679
so many strong countries that getting an

522
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,320
agreement

523
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,880
on so many countries is not always easy

524
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,080
i as the prime minister of

525
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,360
foreign coalition know what i speak

526
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
about so

527
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,159
so that's why uh but i'm glad it worked

528
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,039
well so far

529
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,360
yeah thank you uh carl hublich what's

530
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,799
your take on that when it comes to the

531
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,320
issue of conditionality

532
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,840
and the funds being tied up to

533
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,000
structural reforms well the recovery and

534
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
resilience plan is covering

535
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,120
the czech republic and many of the

536
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
strategies as i mentioned

537
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,240
innovation strategy investment plan uh

538
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,279
let's say

539
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,480
transport strategy and so on and the

540
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,159
government is a specific government we

541
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,760
came many of the members of the

542
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,600
government came from business

543
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,039
and uh let's say we are a little bit

544
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,279
results-oriented

545
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,320
government and business about management

546
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,039
the vision mission long-term growth and

547
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,480
short-term goals and so on

548
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,400
and it's about controlling about your

549
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,159
risk management i would like to

550
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,240
implement the controlling into

551
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,440
this mechanism to do this activities

552
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,240
especially

553
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
at the innovation level special adult

554
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
research and development level

555
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,440
uh as you remember i present that or

556
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,320
introduced that we completely changed

557
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,080
the priorities of the czech republic for

558
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,960
example

559
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
in a field in area of research and

560
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,440
development it's not easy

561
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,200
to for control results

562
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,840
in a science let's say it's the

563
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,080
universities activities and so on

564
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,360
but it's extremely important for example

565
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,559
now my long-term long-term

566
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,840
objective in this field is to achieve

567
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,000
in a 20-25 2.5 persons

568
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,360
uh so-called gert indicator

569
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,279
that's a total expense to r and d

570
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,320
to gdp 2020

571
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,760
uh the level it's uh two cent we achieve

572
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,080
it

573
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,159
in 2020 uh the next goal is 20 25 2.5

574
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,440
percent and 20 30 to achieve the three

575
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,200
percent as a girth indicator three

576
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
percent is extremely high that mean

577
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,919
that then we have a chance to be in the

578
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,279
top five top seven

579
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,799
most innovative countries uh in a in

580
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,120
europe and that's all strategy that's

581
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,320
mean to manage

582
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,640
vision mission but on the other hand to

583
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,360
control

584
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,919
and also uh to balance it at the level

585
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,720
of risk

586
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,960
management because it's a lot of lots of

587
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,320
money

588
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,159
we have received a few questions and i

589
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,080
would like to bring uh the first

590
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,640
of uh the first of those questions to

591
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,559
our speakers the question is coming from

592
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,440
heidi

593
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,480
mara if we can see it now on screen

594
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,720
what are visions of our speakers and how

595
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,960
political solidarity across european

596
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,919
societies

597
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,720
will accompany the economic reforms that

598
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,440
already

599
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,159
highlighted

600
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,520
prime minister well uh what is the

601
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,240
vision

602
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,480
uh on the political solidarity across

603
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,320
europe i think uh well

604
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,679
of course this is uh always uh important

605
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,159
to have in mind and uh we discussed this

606
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,760
on on the summit as well

607
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,640
we have we cannot forget about the fact

608
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,799
that the european union

609
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,360
is one of the best place to live uh in

610
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,399
the world

611
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,120
and i think it's important for us as a

612
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,480
politicians

613
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
uh to be sensitive on that uh on the in

614
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
the political debate or in this

615
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,640
social debate on the national levels

616
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,279
uh because of course even now after the

617
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,720
pandemic we feel

618
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,919
that uh the people are tired out of wha

619
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,360
they've been locked down they've been

620
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,760
going through a crisis

621
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,960
we had to help as the governments but we

622
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,120
cannot forget in in the in the general

623
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,000
debate

624
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,840
that uh there are other places in the

625
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,440
world where uh

626
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,760
we we have to help and i think the

627
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,520
solidarity in general

628
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,919
it's a word that we need to explain much

629
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:40,720
more

630
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,200
in general even in the local local

631
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,799
politics

632
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,200
what i see in the past or over the past

633
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,799
months or years and i think it came with

634
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,120
when we heard first time uh united

635
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,480
states first

636
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,600
uh is this i would say

637
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,840
selfishness and i think it's very very

638
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,880
dangerous for

639
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,840
for the uh developed world to to become

640
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,720
selfish

641
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,120
because we want to allow also other

642
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,840
countries

643
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
to have a good life in the in the world

644
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,919
and there is other topics in the foreign

645
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
policy where we speak of other countries

646
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,960
they will become part of eu etc etc

647
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,880
so yes solidarity is definitely an

648
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,240
important part of our politics

649
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,200
i i i totally share the the vision of of

650
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,120
solidarity in the european union and i

651
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,440
think

652
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,320
all member states can agree on that um i

653
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,080
think where we should become

654
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,159
better is also to have the vision of

655
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,600
being successful

656
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,840
uh because what we sometimes forget

657
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,799
within the eu

658
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,279
is that we compete with other parts of

659
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,679
the world with china with the us

660
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,399
um and and many other countries and if

661
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,640
you look at the economic growth rates

662
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,159
um we have to avoid that we become

663
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,720
a museum with a high standard of living

664
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,039
and i think we always have to repeat

665
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,640
and remind ourselves that the basis

666
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
for solidarity the basis for

667
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,519
public investments the basis for

668
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,919
higher social standards is

669
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,200
competitiveness

670
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,440
and economic growth and if we look for

671
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,519
example at uk

672
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,600
of course they had a very negative

673
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,840
development last year but this year

674
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,559
they will have an economic growth rate

675
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,399
of seven percent for example

676
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,399
um if you look at china at the moment

677
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,200
there's enormous economic growth so i

678
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,000
think

679
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,039
what we should focus on is solidarity

680
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,080
definitely but we always have to remind

681
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,120
ourselves that solidarity is possible

682
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,200
if we are all all 27 27 member states

683
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,880
on their own and all united successful

684
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,559
but how to find that balance how to be

685
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,799
successful and as much as possible

686
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,480
competitive when it comes to the global

687
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,840
stage but also

688
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,760
not scale back that much on solidarity

689
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,240
when it comes to the eu block

690
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,679
well i i think that it is

691
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,679
even easier to show solidarity if we are

692
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,279
all together successful

693
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,000
i think uh it's a question of focus and

694
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,679
what we really want and if we look at

695
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,559
our debates

696
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,240
for example in the european council of

697
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,679
the prime minister level

698
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,840
there are many debates about the green

699
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,720
transformation

700
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,360
which is important there are many

701
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,120
debates about social standards

702
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,480
which is important there are many

703
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
debates about foreign affairs which is

704
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
important as well

705
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,640
but i think a strong focus on

706
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,080
competitiveness

707
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,279
um would also be important and i think

708
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,640
we have it more

709
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,039
in the political debate in the eastern

710
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,320
european countries

711
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,799
and we have it a little less in the

712
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,279
western european countries and in

713
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,360
some probably central european countries

714
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,640
like austria so i think

715
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,970
more focus on these issues

716
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,720
[Music]

717
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,279
is good for all of us thank you thank

718
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,000
you

719
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,760
it works together you're going to do a

720
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,039
great business and

721
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,640
you can also support your social

722
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,880
responsibility why it's the same so

723
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
you have to to balance it just from the

724
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,399
point of view of the sustainable

725
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,000
environment from the point of view i

726
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,640
don't know

727
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,279
green environment or to smart

728
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,559
intelligent growth and

729
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,880
and so on and you have to support let's

730
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,039
say circular economy you have to support

731
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,960
the process of the carbonization

732
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,600
at the same time if you can to implement

733
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,360
the smart solutions

734
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,799
let's say the smart solution in the

735
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,200
industrial segment in agriculture

736
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,679
smart solutions i don't know from you

737
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,240
know

738
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,279
energy sector of of course and uh

739
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,519
from my point of view it's really great

740
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,200
potential great potential

741
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,519
uh for in the cooperation between the

742
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,360
member members member states

743
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,080
but we have to involve also all of the

744
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,600
involved presence while there's a

745
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,200
non-profit institutions

746
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,039
universities let's say the platforms

747
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,679
chamber of commerce confederations trade

748
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,399
unions and so on

749
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,360
i have another question from the from

750
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,240
the audience from

751
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,880
jamie prentice at least 37

752
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,879
of total spending must be allocated

753
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:11,040
towards the green transition

754
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,560
jamie is asking should this figure be

755
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,280
higher than that and i'm gonna add to

756
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,679
that

757
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,199
to jamie's question with such a strict

758
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,040
guidance how to make sure that the whole

759
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,719
process

760
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,480
doesn't become just a box ticking

761
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,719
exercise in some cases about

762
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,320
making sure that it's enough when it

763
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,879
comes to the green transition

764
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,639
well you know actually i will add it

765
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,159
because it's not just green transition

766
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,320
it became over the time a climate

767
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,199
change and uh do no significant harm

768
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,960
came to it etc so

769
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,280
uh i must say for a country like

770
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,239
slovakia it wasn't an easy exercise

771
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,960
but on the other hand in general on the

772
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,079
eu level

773
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,159
uh the investments go this direction

774
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,239
anyway so it's not like

775
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,560
that we pushing something that we are

776
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,560
trying to invent and i don't think it's

777
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,480
a ticking box so uh

778
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,119
there's a lot of talk on on feed 455

779
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,280
etcetera so it goes hand-in-hand in this

780
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
and that that's why it was

781
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,400
uh invented uh this this figure

782
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,760
uh it's just important again on what do

783
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,079
we

784
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,520
invest into within this framework

785
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,000
and we really have to encourage also the

786
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,960
companies

787
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,560
to uh bring uh bring ideas bring

788
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,599
projects

789
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,000
where they bring the higher highest

790
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,960
added value

791
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,040
in some countries it is very developed

792
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,480
so it's going to be easy

793
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,480
to spend uh this percentage and actually

794
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,520
some of them will be

795
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,000
will have even higher uh in country like

796
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,720
slovakia where in certain parts i said

797
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,119
of slovakia we still kind of got stuck

798
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,599
in in time and we weren't able to

799
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,560
invest enough into getting out of 20

800
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,000
20th century

801
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,280
into the 21st we had to really uh

802
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,599
rethink uh what do we do and where do we

803
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,480
spend it

804
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,920
but we went the direction toward the

805
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,720
the emissions decrease and we also went

806
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,119
uh

807
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,880
into schemes for uh houses

808
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,040
where we know that a lot of uh families

809
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,000
has a

810
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,720
has a bad condition houses with the bad

811
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,280
uh

812
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,560
energy uh energy consumptions so that's

813
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,160
where we put a lot of

814
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,920
of this money into these schemes because

815
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,359
it decreases the

816
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:26,720
emissions it also helps the energy usage

817
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,400
so so yeah i think uh i i don't see this

818
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680
as a ticking box

819
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,440
i'm gonna bring here uh the recent few

820
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,960
months ago the european parliament had a

821
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,400
survey showing

822
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,040
europeans want the eu to spend and

823
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,000
invest more in health

824
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,680
of course this is something we all

825
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,119
understand having been through the

826
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,640
pandemic

827
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,119
when asked this question given the

828
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:48,720
current context on which of the

829
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,440
following

830
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,680
would you like the eu money to be spent

831
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
they're very interesting results when it

832
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,440
comes to austria most of the people

833
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,280
said climate change and environmental

834
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,359
protection when it comes to the czech

835
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,119
republic economic recovery and new

836
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,720
opportunities on businesses

837
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,040
when it comes to slovakia employment and

838
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,880
social affairs

839
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,400
this is the results of this area from

840
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,200
just a few months ago

841
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,119
how well when it comes to austria the

842
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,400
people replied that their

843
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,680
that they would like the money to be

844
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,200
spent on climate change environmental

845
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,960
protection and this is what is reflected

846
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,119
in the plan that you have submitted well

847
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,480
i i didn't know uh that but but

848
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,520
sounds good because it's what we what we

849
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,839
do

850
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,119
so uh i i'm happy if people are happy

851
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,200
we we invest more than forty percent of

852
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,160
it uh in

853
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,440
in uh green transformation and about uh

854
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
a bit more than forty percent in in in

855
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,560
digitalization

856
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,359
uh so that that that that sounds uh

857
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,400
quite okay but

858
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,359
um i think for for many people um this

859
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,560
whole thing is still

860
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,079
quite abstract uh and so probably

861
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,320
um i'm not sure if if there's really

862
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,160
such a big gap between the member states

863
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,480
but

864
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
i don't know the figures thank you would

865
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,839
you comment on the results from your

866
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:04,320
country

867
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
yes so the czech republic uh recovery

868
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,680
and resilience plan

869
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,040
presents forty four zero percent of the

870
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,240
uh let's say the green uh transition

871
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,880
uh projects it's a little bit more than

872
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,119
so it's it's uh i'm sorry

873
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,520
and uh you know any czech republic it's

874
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,560
uh

875
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,079
quite uh let's say the specific uh

876
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,560
economic environment uh economic

877
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,520
structure

878
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,960
because especially from the point of

879
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,440
view of energy sector 60

880
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,839
of the central heating systems are based

881
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:36,880
on a co

882
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,839
45 percent of the electricity is based

883
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,800
on the coal

884
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,560
it means that that means that we have

885
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,320
now to transfer all of these

886
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,440
sources to do low emission sources it's

887
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,400
extremely

888
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,440
uh difficult way we are starting now and

889
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,839
of course the futures and renewables

890
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,560
but also nuclear energy and at the same

891
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,280
time we need

892
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,320
support from the european union of the

893
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,760
gas well in the next

894
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,480
maybe let's say 10 15 15 years the same

895
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,640
is it in the industrial segment well

896
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,560
so we are uh one of the most

897
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,079
industrialized

898
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,400
country in the in in europe in the top

899
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,520
three

900
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
and that means that we have to

901
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,040
completely change

902
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,119
the industrial segment and industrial

903
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,119
infrastructure infrastructure

904
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,079
uh to the low emission low emission uh

905
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,160
technology as well and the same is it in

906
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,400
a

907
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,880
transport whereas a 20 percent of the

908
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
emission in czech republic are based on

909
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,839
a

910
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,400
segment of of of transport so there are

911
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,839
huge challenges

912
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,880
and uh we are let's say

913
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,760
uh of uh conservative that's right but

914
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,800
on the other hand

915
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,440
uh the goals well they are i think

916
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,240
extremely

917
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,599
ambitious and uh that's the reason that

918
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,720
40 percent it's the check number of the

919
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,560
resilience plan from the point of view

920
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,119
of the

921
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,839
of the climate changes promised it was

922
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,760
interesting to hear for slovakia

923
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,920
a couple things i need to share here we

924
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,839
know that the recovery plan

925
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:07,119
cannot be used for uh recurring uh

926
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,359
expenses that that's not allowed it's

927
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,119
only for the investments

928
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,319
but even in this era we're going toward

929
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,319
the results of the survey even not

930
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,280
knowing that it will be this result but

931
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,359
uh that's why we have investments

932
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,560
into uh hospitals into the uh

933
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,319
healthcare because we know that there is

934
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,160
a great gap and i think this is one of

935
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,040
the reasons why

936
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,680
the server came as as it came we also

937
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,440
have a lot of investments into the

938
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,400
education

939
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,599
into the kindergarten uh broader

940
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,920
infrastructure and again it's toward the

941
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,119
people to weather

942
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,560
uh their care and also digitalization of

943
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,280
the schools

944
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,319
etc but on the other hand we're thinking

945
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,200
because this is kind of for the presence

946
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,079
for the better

947
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,200
well-being or for the quality of life on

948
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,800
the other hand we had a second pillar

949
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
that was thinking about the future

950
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,440
investments for the future part of it is

951
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,319
the

952
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,880
education but that's a long term but

953
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,440
also

954
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,599
a big amount of the money goes toward

955
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,800
innovation

956
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,800
reform plus really over 600 million

957
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,040
euros goes toward innovations

958
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,119
because this is where we see the future

959
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:19,200
we are very industrial country

960
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,960
automotive as we know and uh we want to

961
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,680
develop and build on this backbone of

962
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,880
our economy

963
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,920
uh into investments into innovations and

964
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,599
as i see the the countries around as

965
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,400
well so

966
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,119
it's a it's a good foundation for future

967
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,160
cooperation

968
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
which i very much look forward and and

969
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,680
these are our great neighbors and

970
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,760
and friends uh as well so uh that's why

971
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,280
uh even uh despite of this this survey

972
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
we had to invest into the future which

973
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,359
is very important for slovakia

974
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,599
i've got another survey for you all

975
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,280
right according to the recent euro

976
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,480
barometer results

977
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,000
uh 43 percent of europeans are satisfied

978
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,760
with measures taking so far by

979
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
national governments to fight the

980
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,960
pandemic 43

981
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,119
that sounds good could it be better of

982
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,520
course it could be my question is how to

983
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,200
make sure that these funds and how to

984
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,720
use those funds to increase that

985
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,480
confidence and increase the trust

986
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,240
towards national governments

987
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,000
from the citizens because of course we

988
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,599
know that this pandemic

989
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,079
has been much more than the healthcare

990
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,240
crisis that was a massive economic and

991
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,680
social crisis

992
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,680
with so many people losing their jobs

993
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,240
and you know their their lives changing

994
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,920
how to use that investment and this

995
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,839
money now to increase this confidence to

996
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,440
help people and maybe what i mean

997
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
going a bit more social and human

998
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,359
oriented

999
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,079
well i think that that we are in a quite

1000
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:42,640
good

1001
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,800
starting position now because the the

1002
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,640
pandemic

1003
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,480
was was difficult to for all of us um

1004
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,680
and it took by far too long but now with

1005
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,800
with the vaccination

1006
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,720
uh campaign going quite well i think

1007
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,880
life is already much better for all of

1008
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,920
us

1009
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,839
at the moment imagine how the situation

1010
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,800
would be without the vaccination think

1011
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,359
back

1012
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,599
how the situation was a few months ago

1013
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,760
it was impossible to meet

1014
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,640
we had video conferences all day many

1015
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,160
people lost their jobs so

1016
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
we are already in a much better

1017
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,280
situation now

1018
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,359
and i think if we keep on vaccinating

1019
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,079
um we will we will be able to overcome

1020
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,280
uh

1021
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,000
this this whole story of course um the

1022
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,520
virus will not be gone

1023
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,760
of course there will be another wave but

1024
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,040
as long

1025
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,599
as we are able to protect especially

1026
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,040
older people

1027
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,240
i think we are in a much better

1028
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,480
situation and i can only speak for for

1029
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,520
our country

1030
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,160
but of course the pandemic hit us hard

1031
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:48,720
of course

1032
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,200
it was terrible to see how many people

1033
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,200
lost their jobs

1034
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,000
we have about 15 percent of our gdp

1035
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,040
dependent from

1036
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,240
tourism um this was terrible for for

1037
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,200
many regions of austria and now even

1038
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,960
these sectors are coming back

1039
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,079
tourism is coming back uh people get uh

1040
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,040
back into their jobs so i i think that

1041
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:11,359
that

1042
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,359
we will have a very positive development

1043
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,440
in the next uh months and years

1044
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,280
and the whole um recovery fund um

1045
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,640
uh is is is is still uh

1046
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,680
in in in the in the in the planning

1047
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,720
status so

1048
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,160
so um spending this money will help even

1049
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,280
more

1050
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,160
thank you prime minister well uh first

1051
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,680
of all we have to admit that

1052
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,200
the kovit 19 found us unprepared

1053
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,200
we didn't expect something like this

1054
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,160
happen and when we saw it in china we

1055
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,960
still

1056
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,319
didn't believe that it's going to come

1057
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,319
in europe and it's going to come in such

1058
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,119
a strong

1059
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,440
strong wave so that's first thing on the

1060
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,400
other hand uh

1061
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,400
i think everybody was trying to be

1062
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,240
flexible as much as possible

1063
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,480
we haven't uh finished yet with the

1064
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,280
pandemi

1065
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
but we learned a lot and of course it

1066
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,359
could be uh done better but

1067
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,000
on the other hand i think we introduced

1068
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,720
a lot of

1069
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,280
instruments for example the the green

1070
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,240
pass now

1071
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,280
and and a lot of procedures uh a lot of

1072
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,119
protocols been developed on

1073
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,240
how to move around uh wearing masks how

1074
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,839
many people can enter etc

1075
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:21,839
this is already prepared and if

1076
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,720
something similar comes we already know

1077
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,720
how how to act much faster and we can

1078
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,400
protect the people much better

1079
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,079
we can prevent to go into such

1080
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,599
a peak as it was so so we learn from

1081
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,680
our own mistakes we'll learn from each

1082
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,160
other i think that that's very important

1083
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,599
43 is it good is it bad well that's what

1084
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:44,400
it is

1085
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,319
it should be better next about that

1086
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,160
glass yes

1087
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,440
exactly so uh the important thing is

1088
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,800
that we don't stop

1089
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,800
we didn't as i said we're not finished

1090
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,880
we're still thinking on how to

1091
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,000
uh live uh with the kovit for the for

1092
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,200
the upcoming uh period vaccination is

1093
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,640
very important we know that we'll have

1094
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,680
to vaccine

1095
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,200
the whole world if we don't want to if

1096
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,960
we really want to get rid of

1097
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,240
uh kovit uh but definitely the level

1098
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:12,960
that we are

1099
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,200
that we will be will be much better for

1100
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,240
the quality of life

1101
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,440
uh in in europe so

1102
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,000
definitely move forward and and not to

1103
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,560
give up

1104
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,000
and not uh relax thank you uh carol

1105
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,440
havelichik what's your take on that

1106
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,400
and as just as before before you start

1107
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,599
get ready with the questions because

1108
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,720
we're going to go into the questions

1109
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,000
from the audience and i would like you

1110
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,280
afterwards to raise your hands to so

1111
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,720
that i can see them please

1112
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,119
well it was extremely difficult prayer

1113
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,280
but now we have to look into the future

1114
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,200
because everybody's expecting the act

1115
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,880
for from our for

1116
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,240
from us and we have to outline the

1117
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,040
future

1118
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,800
not only at the economic level about the

1119
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,119
society level i don't want

1120
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,319
uh to to call that we are let's say

1121
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:58,400
restarting only the economy we are

1122
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,359
starting the

1123
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:02,800
society and the resilience and

1124
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,880
recovery plan from our point of view

1125
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,000
it's not a typical

1126
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,880
economic plan it is a plan as an

1127
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,200
infrastructure plan which is based on

1128
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,839
economic activities research activities

1129
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:14,800
but also

1130
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,760
the health and resilience activities and

1131
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,359
that's the reason that we are

1132
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,960
investing from from this point of view

1133
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,319
six percent uh to strengthening the

1134
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:27,760
resilience in a

1135
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,200
health uh care systems and free prince

1136
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,400
persons to the research activities based

1137
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,520
on a health

1138
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,960
health area so so it's not only about

1139
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,880
the economic restart well

1140
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,040
thank you we gonna go into the questions

1141
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,760
from the audience i'm gonna just ask you

1142
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,000
to keep them rather brief because you

1143
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,440
know you cannot hold the microphone due

1144
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,800
to of course the coveted measures

1145
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,359
we have a question there could you could

1146
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,319
we please go for the

1147
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:58,559
yes could you stand up q and please keep

1148
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,160
it rather

1149
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,000
brief there we go um i'm ayman

1150
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,920
visiting a professor at the college of

1151
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,319
europe my question is about

1152
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,000
conditionalities are they only about

1153
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,440
structural reforms

1154
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,839
or there should be because the eu is a

1155
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,760
normative force also in the world

1156
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,520
conditionality is related to rule of law

1157
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,359
when it comes to independent judiciary

1158
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,160
free press non-discrimination lgbt

1159
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,839
rights etc what's your take on this

1160
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,079
thank you

1161
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,440
well i i i share um

1162
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,240
that it was a big debate and also one of

1163
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,119
the

1164
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,599
points we as frugal countries brought

1165
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:36,640
into debate

1166
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,640
that rule of law has to be a basis if

1167
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,319
one member of the european union wants

1168
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,839
to get a lot of money from other member

1169
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,000
states which have to pay for that and

1170
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,559
of course as always in the eu we had to

1171
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,040
find a compromise so a bit more would

1172
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,400
have been good

1173
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,160
but at least we agreed to something on

1174
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,240
rule of law here

1175
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,240
on behalf of the action and the decision

1176
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,000
process i think it was important that

1177
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,800
this was recovery and resilience plan

1178
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,359
in order to help the economies the

1179
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,160
governments

1180
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,839
that's why the structural reforms are

1181
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,000
very important and it goes from country

1182
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,359
to country which needed uh what reform

1183
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,400
more

1184
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,559
so therefore i don't really see a reason

1185
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,760
for having such a

1186
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,880
condition in the conditions on the other

1187
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,680
hand

1188
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:30,079
we are a european union as i said one of

1189
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:30,960
the best place

1190
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,760
to live it's a democratic environment

1191
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,079
and

1192
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,200
for us rule of law is is uh importance

1193
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,079
number one because any democracy cannot

1194
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:40,800
grow in

1195
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,880
other environment other than in a state

1196
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,480
of uh where the rule of law is

1197
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,839
fully active so uh so therefore i think

1198
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:48,400
this is

1199
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,480
this is a ground field and if we see

1200
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,440
that there are

1201
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,359
uh some other views on it it's

1202
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,359
definitely good to have a debate on it

1203
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,440
and and try to understand what's what's

1204
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,480
behind it

1205
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,359
uh but we have to also understand that

1206
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:02,640
uh european union

1207
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,160
is a is a union of uh autonomic

1208
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,440
countries with their with their

1209
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,319
sovereignty

1210
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,960
therefore i am a very much a great fan

1211
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,359
of

1212
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:13,760
communication of a discussion because

1213
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,640
that's what

1214
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,359
friends do and we shouldn't be uh be

1215
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:18,160
afraid of

1216
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,960
talking also about difficult topics but

1217
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,559
it always starts with

1218
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,880
listening and then it goes further on

1219
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,559
but for slovakia as you see

1220
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,040
the the current situation rule of law is

1221
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,480
really something that we want to build

1222
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,680
slovakia into

1223
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,160
we want to make a slovakia a solid

1224
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,680
democratic country

1225
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,880
with uh strong roots of rule of law

1226
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,640
so we have an opportunity a great

1227
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,040
opportunity to manage the plan as a

1228
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,119
european plan known only as a plan of

1229
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,880
the particular country as well

1230
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,680
and that's the power of of this uh

1231
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,720
initiative of

1232
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,680
of this plan and it's like any business

1233
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,359
in a balance sheet as you know on the

1234
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,280
left side there are the assets on the

1235
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,160
right side and the other equity and

1236
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,200
liabilities

1237
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,440
assets that's right so infrastructure

1238
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,800
and digitization

1239
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,800
physical infrastructure and um

1240
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,119
assets on the right side uh equity

1241
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,280
social responsibility well and of course

1242
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,720
the debts we have to

1243
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,040
to pay to the 2d to the let's say

1244
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,720
suppliers in this

1245
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,800
from this point of view uh they are the

1246
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,040
uh that uh they are closely connected

1247
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,480
well because it's closer connected to

1248
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:26,720
the

1249
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,599
national uh financial budget so and all

1250
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:30,800
of this must be

1251
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,559
balanced and that's that's that's the

1252
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,960
way how to tell me a little bit about

1253
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:51,839
your plans to address this issue

1254
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:56,640
thank you for the question prime

1255
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,079
minister do you want to start

1256
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,319
well uh yes the the question

1257
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,880
of the winners and losers yeah

1258
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:19,760
this

1259
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,640
the whole pandemy was definitely very

1260
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,760
asymmetric in this and

1261
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,960
slovakia is a country of industry uh it

1262
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,920
helped us a lot

1263
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,640
to to really not have such a bad numbers

1264
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:30,960
we

1265
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,480
when at the beginning we expected that

1266
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,559
we're going to have a decrease

1267
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,359
in gdp or almost 10 percent and uh it

1268
00:52:37,359 --> 00:52:38,000
end up

1269
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,599
not even 5. uh it was also

1270
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,079
that we invested on uh the government

1271
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,040
help toward the

1272
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,839
employment this uh very famous court

1273
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:48,720
serbiate

1274
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,359
everybody knows it uh by now in slovakia

1275
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:51,760
it'll

1276
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,040
help very much to protect the the people

1277
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,079
with their jobs etc so therefore i think

1278
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,400
the countries responded depending uh as

1279
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,559
they need it in their recovery plans and

1280
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:03,680
i think it's good

1281
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,280
but as i mentioned in the beginning it's

1282
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,960
not only about with the recovery plan it

1283
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,640
was also about what we did during the

1284
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,400
pandemic how we were helping

1285
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,280
uh to maximum possible uh and still

1286
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,400
protecting the south

1287
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,160
and the czech republic it's extremely

1288
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,079
low i know well but uh

1289
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,359
definitely in all of the central

1290
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:20,960
european countries the rate of

1291
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,440
unemployment is raw differential flow

1292
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,680
uh and the losers of course the

1293
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,640
retailers

1294
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,720
small services well that's the reason

1295
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,240
that we uh

1296
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,800
supported these segments uh extremely a

1297
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,920
lot of a lot of

1298
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,359
sources 15 billions check

1299
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,720
15 billion euros we uh

1300
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,119
by 50 milli billion euros we supported

1301
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,960
uh the segments of the small

1302
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,119
and medium pattern prices especially in

1303
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:48,559
a business field like

1304
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,440
services restaurants and and small small

1305
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,240
retailers

1306
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,480
but we have to finish this support now

1307
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,079
and to start a new

1308
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,480
type of support based on investment

1309
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,880
support based on innovation support

1310
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,760
based on let's say the programs as a

1311
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:04,720
guarantees

1312
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,760
the loans and banking loans guarantees

1313
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,800
and to stop

1314
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,720
now uh the special program based on a

1315
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,559
cool sub and so on because we have to

1316
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,119
balance and manage also the labor market

1317
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,319
well

1318
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,760
