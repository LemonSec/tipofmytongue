42
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,160

46
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,279
40 minutes to get through a lot of

47
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
ground so let's get straight

48
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,279
underway i think a good place to start

49
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,560
this conversation would be

50
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,120
with you matush as you're the host of

51
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880

um when we look at the pandemic and the

53
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,480
impact on urban centers

54
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,680
what kind of capacity have cities needed

55
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,040
to build quickly

56
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,120
to counter these evolving crises can you

57
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,519

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,600
globsec in our city

66
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
uh to ask for your question i mean

67
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,839
the the the first thing is that you you

68
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:44,800
are not ready for

69
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,959
such a crisis nobody was ready for such

70
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,920
a crisis as

71
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,279
uh as we are living now and uh

72
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,279
i need to go through very quick uh i'm

73
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,640
making fun of it the lessons about the

74
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
the how about management in crisis which

75
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,600
is something completely different i was

76
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,160
trained

77
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,360
in i'm a trained architect with 15 years

78
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
of experience

79
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,640
so the first thing was uh uh

80
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,279
maybe not first in the list of

81
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,040
importance but one of very important

82
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,880
thing was to build a

83
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,000
good communication channel we are

84
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,079
always spending a lot of time to explain

85
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,040
to our citizen

86
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,800
and to inhabitants of brazil was

87
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
happening and we were ready for that we

88
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,000
have very good

89
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
communication team so there was maybe

90
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,760
the first thing

91
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,040
to to completely open every bit of

92
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,800
information we were sure of and to

93
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,880
communicate to explain to make

94
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
make them feel safer in terms of having

95
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,320
uh

96
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,279
right and exact informations that was

97
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,399
the one of the first thing

98
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,200
and of course after there you have a

99
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,320
group of citizens

100
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,920
you are taking care of which are for us

101
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,640
the most

102
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,000
uh uh group of these citizens in danger

103
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,560
where

104
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,200
elderly people that's very important you

105
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,839
know how

106
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,200
covet is working so this is our focus

107
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,040
straight away and i need to say

108
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,680
before we had any case of covet in

109
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,800
slovakia

110
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,839
during the march during the february of

111
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,079
2020

112
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,440
we already did a special training for uh

113
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,640
for employees in our older houses we did

114
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,079
a special measurement

115
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,320
in these older houses to to be ready and

116
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,800
to to start protection very soon and i'm

117
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,160
glad we did it and

118
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,279
it shows uh how good team

119
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,760
we have in bratislava in this case and

120
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,600
of course the second group of citizens

121
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,160
are

122
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,640
uh people without homes that's very

123
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,240
important they cannot go

124
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
to have current teams somewhere they

125
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,480
don't just don't have a place to be

126
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
14 000 people we built very very soon

127
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,079
a year ago in march 2020 we built

128
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,800
we are calling it also today village

129
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,079
quarantine village

130
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
so we build a temporary structure where

131
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
people without homes

132
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,480
can spend day two or three weeks of

133
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,680
kovit

134
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,920
and so they can don't need to be in the

135
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,800
streets where

136
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
and in danger of to other people but

137
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,160
also to themselves

138
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,200
of course uh so this was the

139
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
i mean all if you are talking about what

140
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,639
we

141
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,880
what we were forced to build what kind

142
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,000
of capacities

143
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,560
is it was like all of them all of

144
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
possible capacities i

145
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,480
i'm thinking now and you have this real

146
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,519
question about the

147
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,279
the role of city administrations in

148
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,720
providing just the services you talked

149
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,000
about in a time of crisis

150
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
but then what is the what is the gap

151
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
between central government and city

152
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
administrations vit

153
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,240
you obviously work on this issue very

154
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,440
closely your political party and the

155
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,639
czech republic is

156
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,639
set up to represent the interests of of

157
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,120
mayors and and independents i wonder do

158
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
you think the balance is right right now

159
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,519
between city administrations and central

160
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
government or the cities need more power

161
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
so firstly thank you for the invitation

162
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,440
i am not

163
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,680
the mayor and i used to be the mayor of

164
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,360
colleen so of the middle

165
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,240
size city of small city 30 000

166
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,279
inhabitants

167
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,760
it's my big pleasure to communicate here

168
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,399
with the

169
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,279
mayors of capitals of their countries

170
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,880
but i have to say

171
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,839
the smaller cities it was really a huge

172
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:20,639
challenge

173
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,680
for them because they are not in direct

174
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,480
contact

175
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
with the state government and every

176
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,639
good solution had to grow up from the

177
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,680
bottom

178
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,440
and the real responsibility was really

179
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
by the time of the covet crisis on the

180
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,279
local government and when you see the

181
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,120
numbers of the trust of the people in

182
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
the czech republic now

183
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,399
the trust in the local government

184
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,040
increased the trust in the state's

185
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,760
government

186
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,639
decreased and i think it's the best

187
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,199
proof

188
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,399
that we all the mayors around the world

189
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,600
we did really a great job by this time

190
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,800
and i have to say something to your

191
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,240
answer yes communication and you

192
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,160
have to see all different groups of

193
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,760
people in your city because

194
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,120
you want to communicate fast you have

195
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,000
some smart

196
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,800
applications and you can communicate

197
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,760
fast with the

198
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,040
younger people but you have to find the

199
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,320
right way

200
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
how to communicate with all people

201
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
if you're in your town you have to see

202
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,360
the needs

203
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,920
of all groups of citizens in your

204
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,959
community

205
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,680
and it was big challenge because you

206
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
have to use

207
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,079
the old towns radio

208
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,199
you have to get the information to the

209
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,880
people in the streets

210
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,600
because also the older people can hear

211
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,160
them

212
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
you have to use the towns magazine and

213
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,600
you have to communicate

214
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,440
also the decisions of your government

215
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
because by the time of crisis

216
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,519
you as the mayor you as the member of

217
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,880
the city council

218
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,760
you are responsible for everything you

219
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
are you you

220
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,480
you have become the crisis manager

221
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,880
not the mayor more and you have to

222
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,519
manage

223
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,000
everything in your time you have to be

224
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,959
all the day

225
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,240
on the phone and the people call you and

226
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
ask you really everything it was

227
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
something very new

228
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,839
and you have to do your usual agenda

229
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,720
and you don't have time for it you have

230
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,320
a lot of stress by

231
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,519
this moment and you don't have

232
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
any crisis scenarios for

233
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,399
the crisis like this one was

234
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,079
it was everything new and i have to say

235
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,199
the local level didn't

236
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,720
fail by this situation and it's

237
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,839
important message

238
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,880
for the citizens of the cities and it

239
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,759
was also

240
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,880
the best way how to show you are real

241
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
responsible for the town and uh the

242
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
states level the communication sorry for

243
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,839
it

244
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,079
was horrible well well let's get on to

245
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,759
that now and actually switch to budapest

246
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,160
because

247
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,519
there's a huge issue the conflict

248
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,199
between the people that have to manage

249
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,720
the crisis on a ground level

250
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
and then the central government which

251
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,079
largely allocates the resources to do

252
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,040
that job and

253
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,680
it's switching to budapest and the mayor

254
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,279
there you know

255
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,199
how difficult is it to do your job when

256
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,399
you're an open conflict with the

257
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,759
government and can you speak a little

258
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,199
bit about your experience dealing with

259
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,560
the pandemic over the last year and a

260
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
half

261
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,519
well heartfelt welcome to everyone i'm

262
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,759
really glad to be here

263
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,440
at this very very high level event

264
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
when there is a crisis it is very very

265
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,680
important

266
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,759
to have good cooperation between the

267
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,920
different actors between the different

268
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,319
protagonists now in our situation there

269
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,160
were three different parties

270
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,280
that should have collaborated central

271
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160
government

272
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,280
and also the pandemic institutions or

273
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,559
healthcare institutions

274
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,799
and then the municipalities budapest

275
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,640
municipality and district municipalities

276
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,720
and the third party is the citizens the

277
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,160
inhabitants so there should have been a

278
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,039
very good cooper

279
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,559
collaboration between all of them now

280
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,559
i have to say that the relationship the

281
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,559
collaboration between the city

282
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,280
management and the city inhabitants was

283
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,240
excellent

284
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,000
and we also thought what bratislava said

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,240
that every information had to be shared

286
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,080
whether it was sad information

287
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
bad information negative information and

288
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,679
if we were not sure about something we

289
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,320
would also

290
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,640
share our doubts with the people i think

291
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,039
that this really worked

292
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,760
and in budapest the statistics have

293
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,400
shown

294
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,799
that uh within the entire country

295
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,840
budapest were

296
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,360
the most the ones who most respected the

297
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,240
rules

298
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
like if you look at google statistics

299
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,240
and google location statistics

300
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
uh or network uh gsm network statistics

301
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,720
that showed that budapest people were

302
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
were very very disciplined despite the

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,200
fact that normally an

304
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
urban population according to certain

305
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
theories is much less

306
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,120
law obedient and much less tolerant to

307
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,039
these

308
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,799
limitations but statistics show that

309
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,480
budapest were very disciplined

310
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,039
however the cooperation between the

311
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,919
central government

312
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,640
and the municipality now that didn't

313
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,440
really work

314
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,679
and i was very sad i'm very sad to say

315
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,520
that in the most difficult situation

316
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,880
when we're supposed to to

317
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,679
stand together in that situation there

318
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,799
were very very

319
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,080
nasty political debates uh uh i also got

320
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,400
a

321
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,160
supporting letter from uh bayer

322
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,480
matusvallo when there was a

323
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,520
a uh hate campaign launched against

324
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
the budapest to add early homes and i'm

325
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
just telling you statistics

326
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,080
it was the the elderly homes of the

327
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
budapest of budapest

328
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,799
where the mortality rate was much less

329
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,120
than

330
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,880
in state institutions or national

331
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,960
institutions because we

332
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,120
actually gathered all international

333
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,880
experience and they said that okay

334
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,720
if our government is not talking to us

335
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,799
we would talk to other mayors

336
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,520
and we tried to make everything in a

337
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
timely manner all of the

338
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
measures now this was true for the

339
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,960
austerity measures

340
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,120
and also after the crisis was over

341
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,320
we also started to make the

342
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,200
ease down the easing of the lockdown

343
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,480
faster than the central government let

344
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,240
me give you a particular example

345
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
when prague made mask a wearing mask

346
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
compulsory on mass transportation

347
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
this was like last march march 2020

348
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,160
maybe first in europe then

349
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,840
the hungarian government's official

350
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,600
position was

351
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,039
that mask should not be worn there were

352
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,559
different billboards in hungarian

353
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,880
hospitals saying that wearing masks is

354
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,440
negative

355
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,080
only ill sick people should wear masks

356
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,440
now under these a

357
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,400
very odd circle absurd circumstances we

358
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,960
had to

359
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,720
work and i have to say that the

360
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
unpreparedness of the government and the

361
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,760
fact that they did not share

362
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,320
information they were just uh entering

363
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:18,840
into

364
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,840
a success propaganda

365
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,000
as opposed to our very um

366
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
true communication so this resulted in

367
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,520
the fact that a lot of people in the

368
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
countryside did not take

369
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,600
the pandemic seriously they were not

370
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
following the rules they were not

371
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,919
wearing the masks

372
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,080
and as a result of that there were much

373
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,679
more death cases

374
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,360
mortality was much higher in the

375
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,120
countryside despite the fact that

376
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,200
budapest is a very dense city

377
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,360
is an international metropolis there is

378
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,799
a lot of communication a lot of

379
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,679
traveling

380
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
despite that there were much more death

381
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,919
rates in the countryside

382
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,400
and this really shows that holding back

383
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,440
information

384
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,039
um spreading not spreading information

385
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,880
this is really life-threatening in such

386
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,240
a crisis

387
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,520
so you you talked a lot about

388
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
collaboration as well and lessons

389
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,880
learned and talking to your colleagues

390
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
in prague or bratislava about the

391
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,360
situation and

392
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,600
bringing policies composite to that but

393
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,280
i wonder if we could address one of the

394
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
specific problems that all of you have

395
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,559
in managing cities and that's mobility

396
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,520
and transport

397
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,200
now there is a huge fight everywhere

398
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,039
pandemic or no pandemic about

399
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
the space for cars on the street whether

400
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,240
or not cycling lanes should be

401
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
buttressed all of you are having to deal

402
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,960
with that separately in your urban areas

403
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,520
specifically how are you facing this

404
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,039
situation because on the one hand all

405
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,720
cities are investing in cycle lanes all

406
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,919
cities know they need to improve air

407
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,960
pollution levels

408
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,960
however motorists are very angry about

409
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,400
this and they want to be able to freely

410
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,760
commute into urban centers

411
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
what can you do to stop this war between

412
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,600
the two sides

413
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,840
i mean we are the city which decided to

414
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,159
never stop public transport you have

415
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,880
like the city divided in two parts

416
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,039
there were a few cities which completely

417
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,720
stopped public transport we decided not

418
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,840
to do that

419
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,120
and we are losing still losing a lot of

420
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,039
a lot of euros a month and

421
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,520
i need to say that in the worst it was

422
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,120
january

423
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,159
2021 where we had like 10 or

424
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,720
15 of people in our public transport in

425
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,840
comparison of

426
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,360
of two years ago uh but

427
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,320
i spent first a year and a half of my of

428
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,640
my

429
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,919
of my work as a mayor in brazil to

430
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,600
to invite people into the public

431
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,080
transport we are pouring money into it

432
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,400
we

433
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,600
we changing it for better and uh and

434
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,120
it's very difficult for us to say

435
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,520
don't use public transport it's not safe

436
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
but where it was necessary

437
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,000
we did it but we also keep it working

438
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,559
because

439
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,679
there are still people who need it and

440
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,080
this is also our only answer to two

441
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,039
problems with

442
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,440
with transport in general transparent

443
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,480
bratislava

444
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,720
we need to return when it's going to be

445
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,840
safe to do public transport because uh

446
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,280
we cannot we cannot travel in the city

447
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,000
by cars

448
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,320
it's never going to work we cannot make

449
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,280
streets bigger

450
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,320
it's not working in this way and

451
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,720
and it's again connected with our

452
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,400
campaign for vaccination

453
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,320
because that's the that's the way how we

454
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
can in safeway

455
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,240
return to public transport i need to say

456
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
when we are talking about cycling

457
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,640
of course is our desire to to use this

458
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,000
situation or

459
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,159
it was our desire to use this situation

460
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,039
to have

461
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,600
and to be more radical in terms of new

462
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,240
message

463
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,200
cycleways and so on but i need to say

464
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,400
maybe in comparison

465
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,919
with other cities the fact

466
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,600
that we are installing or building a new

467
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,799
uh cycleway or in the end

468
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,840
must be decided but state police

469
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,760
and and they don't have in bratislava

470
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
are not at all understanding for bus

471
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,080
lines or cyclones so this is the fight

472
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,039
we are doing

473
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,559
if uh even before kovit yeah

474
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,559
and just to switch to budapest in gergia

475
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,760
uh you know

476
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,279
you are facing big problems there i

477
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,200
understand because of course you also

478
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
are very favorable to cycling lanes you

479
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,159
want to roll out clean mobility

480
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,120
infrastructure there

481
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,039
but the motorists are battling back how

482
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,799
can you solve this situation in budapest

483
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,159
in the wake of the pandemic

484
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,320
has that has that changed the perception

485
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,240
of many of the city population about

486
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,480
public transport and about cycle lanes

487
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,360
and the need for

488
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,840
clean open air mobility

489
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,799
similar processes were there in budapest

490
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,240
similar to what we've heard about

491
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,440
bratislava

492
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,039
the decision was to reduce

493
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,200
mass transportation not to stop mass

494
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,720
transportation just like

495
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,799
in bratislava we didn't stop it and

496
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,320
again there was a huge drop

497
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,120
in our revenues and there were some

498
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
other economic and financial problems as

499
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,679
well but as

500
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,760
i said a community transportation mass

501
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
transportation revenues dropped

502
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,240
dramatically

503
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,760
we were also very very um worried

504
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,400
that uh public transportation is a

505
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
source of danger under the pandemic but

506
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,520
now we can see

507
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,279
from the statistics that only one or two

508
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,520
percent of the infections came from

509
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,120
public transportation

510
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,440
there were much more dangerous uh things

511
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,039
uh because you know there were

512
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,720
no in our case most of the people

513
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,320
respected the mask

514
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,480
obligation mask wearing obligation and

515
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,400
normally you know people do not

516
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
have a chat in the metro or in the bus

517
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,559
so it didn't really spread in the

518
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,360
uh public transportation so i fully

519
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,480
agree with matus

520
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,240
that on the long run motorization

521
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,480
has to be replaced by an alternative you

522
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,480
cannot use just cars in the city

523
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,320
and this is going to be a long-term

524
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,720
effort to bring back people to mass

525
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,600
transportation

526
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
now as far as not only from the terms of

527
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,520
revenues but

528
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,080
in terms of using so using it we had

529
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,960
some ad hoc

530
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,159
interventions in the city in the city

531
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,400
we

532
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,679
made interventions preparing mass

533
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,640
transportation and

534
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,279
cycling so in budapest we doubled the

535
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,559
number of cycle

536
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,440
of a bicycle riders in a year we doubled

537
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,400
the number

538
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,600
and also we have created a new public

539
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,000
bike sharing system so we have a bike

540
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
sharing system a new system now

541
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,840
uh quite quickly we managed to build

542
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,480
that up which is very popular now

543
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,760
and apparently uh the demand

544
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,200
even says that we should double or

545
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
triple the capacity but now that life

546
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,480
is back in the city and a lot of people

547
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,559
most of people work again do work again

548
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,679
and there is commun

549
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,240
commuting there is movement yes indeed

550
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,360
there is a conflict

551
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,480
between motorists so cars

552
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,919
and others because now

553
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,120
you know the entire um transportation

554
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
and traffic is increasing and there is a

555
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,200
conflict but on the long run i think

556
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,360
it is a mass transportation and the

557
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,240
clean forms of transportation that will

558
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,760
work in such a big city

559
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,679
and this conflict is also increased by

560
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,120
the fact that a lot of

561
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,279
investments that we had to stop during

562
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,640
the pandemic because the

563
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,320
construction industry also stopped we

564
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,159
have to relaunch these investments it is

565
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,000
just today this very day that we are

566
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,080
closing one of the bridges of budapest

567
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,919
which was the first permanent bridge on

568
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,080
the danube in in hungary

569
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,679
and for one and a half years we'll have

570
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,120
to close down this bridge and the cars

571
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,000
will not be able to uh cross it

572
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,760
right i want to come back at you because

573
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,279
you you made an interesting point about

574
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,640
returning cities to

575
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,520
to volatile great normal life on the

576
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
streets with bars and cafes open but

577
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,320
just first to go to vit

578
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
i come to you last on this point because

579
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,440
you obviously have a national view and i

580
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,919
wonder

581
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,440
from your party perspective and having

582
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,360
been a town mayor do you think it should

583
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,679
be

584
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,000
only up to city administrations how they

585
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,840
invest in their public transport systems

586
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,600
after the pandemic we're talking about

587
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,960
the building of new cycle lanes

588
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,640
investing in public

589
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
mass transit infrastructure is this a

590
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,919
question for cities or do you think

591
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,679
there should be a national push

592
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,600
everywhere to really roll out cycle

593
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
lanes and such like

594
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,559
so i'm sure you have to have the state

595
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,679
strategy

596
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,440
uh you have to have the regional

597
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,679
strategy and the city strategy

598
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,799
but i'm afraid of big power of

599
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,000
local governments i have really we are

600
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,440
close to the people

601
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
and i love the decision-making

602
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,000
close to the people it's the wonder

603
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,880
of local governing because you know the

604
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,480
real needs of people

605
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,760
you are in touch with people and you can

606
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,320
prepare

607
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,279
the town strategy for the particular

608
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,480
needs of your

609
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,480
own town and it's the right way

610
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,679
in the case of my town we tried to

611
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,039
support a public

612
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,679
transport we try to prepare the

613
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,039
infrastructure

614
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,440
for electro mobility it's a big

615
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,039
challenge for the next

616
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,080
years in every city not only

617
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,440
in the capitals of the lands and what we

618
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,880
try to do is to speak to all group of

619
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,000
citizens

620
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,360
and to be mediator uh

621
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,399
in this conflict between car drivers

622
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,520
and bikers and it's the huge discussion

623
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,120
in every town in the czech republic

624
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,080
and you have to have some vision for

625
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,640
future

626
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,080
our very simple vision is everything for

627
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,200
our children

628
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,679
and for our parents is the official

629
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,120
vision of our town

630
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
and when we want to do everything for

631
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,559
our children

632
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,760
we have to create the

633
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,240
streets which are full of green and

634
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,440
which are full

635
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,960
of bikers lines in the town

636
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,840
because it's the time of living we

637
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,799
prefer

638
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,360
in our city but you have to come with

639
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,399
the situation

640
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,279
the number of the cars is really huge

641
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,600
you have to find the right solution

642
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,120
for parking capacities but you have to

643
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,600
prepare the best infrastructure for the

644
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,480
bikers

645
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,159
we did we we built a new parking

646
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,760
house for bikers in front of the

647
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,440
river station in korean and it helped

648
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,799
it helped a lot because we have this

649
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,520
parking house full of bikes every

650
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,399
morning

651
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,159
so it goes slowly but you have to find

652
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,600
the right solution i think

653
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,679
and matosh how do we get back to normal

654
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,360
life now in cities and then looking

655
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,840
ahead

656
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,000
you think in five years time what will

657
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you look back at brad osava and say

658
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,960
okay now we do this really differently

659
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,360
to

660
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,960
to what we did before the pandemic so

661
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,720
what elements of normal life will be

662
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,760
completely different

663
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,039
to what they were two years ago

664
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,320
yeah the this one is tough one because

665
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
uh

666
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
of course uh i i need to say that

667
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,799
uh the first thing i understand that

668
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,279
uh that we did something right because

669
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,559
the team

670
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,919
of my colleagues uh it proves uh

671
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,880
itself to be a very good one you never

672
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,279
know

673
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,880
the real the the real situation you have

674
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,080
in your team

675
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,320
uh in a good situation you cannot see

676
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,440
that and

677
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,159
uh what i did in uh what we did in right

678
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:20,720
good way

679
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
is to choose right people which are

680
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,279
governing bratislav with me or with us

681
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,279
you know and that's very important

682
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,720
in crisis we thought that it it's it's

683
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,440
the team is absolutely one of the the

684
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
pivotal things

685
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,200
so in five years i will be sure like

686
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,000
today that

687
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,120
uh that the the people around me uh

688
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,360
are good choosing and that that's very

689
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,159
important

690
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,480
what is going to be different of course

691
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,279
it's

692
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,039
how we are looking in our

693
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,399
situation in general way uh you know

694
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,480
it's never we it's never going to be

695
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,760
like before

696
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,960
because we know that some this kind of

697
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,679
crisis

698
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,240
can come and uh completely stop the

699
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,880
world

700
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
it wasn't about bratislava it wasn't

701
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
about europe this this is a whole

702
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,279
planet uh which stops for a few months

703
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,159
and and

704
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,960
this crack the crisis is very serious

705
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,919
one

706
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,039
and so of course i will always keep in

707
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,679
mind that we need to have some back door

708
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,320
not in on not only in terms of money or

709
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,840
in the situation we are

710
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,440
actually in but in terms of what maybe

711
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,240
there are

712
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,840
some kind of list of values should be uh

713
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,120
we're going to to do more for of course

714
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
these two group of our citizen

715
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,279
even if we're doing a lot for for

716
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,720
elderly people and

717
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,120
homeless people because we we thought i

718
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,000
saw that

719
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,960
that it's so it's the the thing a bit

720
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,279
the

721
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,880
line between definitely alive and dead

722
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,120
is

723
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,159
so so thin and and was was so difficult

724
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:56,799
to to

725
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,360
to keep it straight this light so um

726
00:32:59,360 --> 00:32:59,919
this is

727
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,880
uh this is real and actually people

728
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,039
wants to go to back to the normal we

729
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,919
saw it in during the first uh first dead

730
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:08,320
where

731
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,880
the the restriction was uh was uh

732
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,000
was in the end and and people were crazy

733
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
in the street everybody was

734
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,960
celebrating drinking and people are

735
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,880
going back to the normal i think it's

736
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,320
our uh

737
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,840
task uh municipalities for example

738
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,000
to have always in mind that the

739
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,360
situation can change in

740
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,159
in few few months yeah very radically uh

741
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,600
we're rapidly running out of time but i

742
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,360
just want to go to you vit with the same

743
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,159
question you know

744
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,760
what's the path back to normality in

745
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,200
cities now and also

746
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,799
what in five years will you look back

747
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,480
and say this is completely different to

748
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,320
what we had before the pandemic

749
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,519
so we should divide it into what we will

750
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,120
see in reality and to what we should see

751
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,640
and i think we should see much more

752
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,320
power for the local sphere in decision

753
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,760
making also much more money

754
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,640
for the local investments from the site

755
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,039
of

756
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,239
state and much bigger

757
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,639
trust from the side of the state's

758
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,760
government

759
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,199
in the local governments it will be a

760
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,520
big

761
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,040
discussion of the next years and

762
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,359
you know the time was really challenging

763
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,560
and it had a lot of different sides

764
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,079
one of them we have in our town a huge

765
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,480
vietnamese community

766
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,159
and they were so helpful

767
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,359
in the time of pandemic so active

768
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,719
financial and they were prepared to

769
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,079
help to everybody and it helped us

770
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,918
in reality to overcome some prejudices

771
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,359
in our city so it's one of the positive

772
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,800
results of this time it was also

773
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,560
challenging in the question of

774
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,760
developing

775
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,200
some new types of communication

776
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,240
with citizens we have special we have

777
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,359
special

778
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,400
uh town cities application

779
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,640
and we can deliver the information

780
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,240
to the citizen very fast and

781
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,920
it still works it's the positive result

782
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,280
of this pandemic time so i think the

783
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,839
communication between the local

784
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:32,480
government

785
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,520
and the citizen is after the pandemic

786
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,160
time

787
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,960
much more closer and also the

788
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,280
conservative representatives of the

789
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,000
towns

790
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,280
are able and ready to come communicate

791
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,560
on networks are able to be

792
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,440
in touch with people every day and it's

793
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,200
one of the positive results of the

794
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,920
pandemic and

795
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,320
it's also the future of the governing of

796
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,359
cities yeah

797
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,800
that's an interesting point let's go

798
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,560
back to budapest to address this because

799
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
you know more than any other mayor i

800
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,320
think you you're swimming very much

801
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,280
against uh

802
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,880
central government on a number of issues

803
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,640
in the context of the lg

804
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,880
bt law that was passed this week in

805
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,400
hungary i mean

806
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,480
pride is coming up on july the 3rd how

807
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,079
do you as a mayor

808
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,760
try to bring norman life back into

809
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,040
budapest while maintaining its

810
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,960
reputation as you know a huge vibrant

811
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,839
capital of

812
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,760
europe in the context of a really

813
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,359
rancorous political debate at the

814
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,079
national level

815
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,320
too

816
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,240
again you know

817
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,359
one of the findings of the pandemic that

818
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:44,960
the old green thinking of think globally

819
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,359
act

820
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,880
locally this is prime probably even more

821
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,800
true after the pandemic than it was

822
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,280
before i fully agree

823
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,560
that governance of tomorrow has to

824
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,640
have much more weight on the local

825
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,599
governments

826
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,520
because it is more democratic on the one

827
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,280
hand and it is more effective on the

828
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,000
other hand

829
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,960
so the municipal level the hungarian

830
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,119
government quite often

831
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,560
just tries to confront

832
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,320
um you know effective governors and

833
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,640
democratic governors they say that

834
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,560
if it's not democratic governors it is

835
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,839
much more effective

836
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,920
but this is just the contrary and just

837
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
the opposite as it turned out

838
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,040
during the pandemic if you're closer to

839
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,320
the people you can

840
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,440
just govern much more effectively now

841
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,400
the other thing

842
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,560
once we are talking about global issues

843
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,400
in this panel

844
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,880
the exposure of the world the world is

845
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,760
exposed

846
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,480
this exposure is is not

847
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,440
sustainable on long-term realm actually

848
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:47,839
the

849
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,000
supply chains has to be smaller because

850
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,599
if there is a crisis in china everything

851
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,240
stops

852
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,800
if there is a ship that blocks the sewer

853
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,520
scanner

854
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,760
then everything stops so i think the

855
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,359
world will have to focus on

856
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,000
local economy more and will have to

857
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,320
create much shorter supply chains i

858
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,160
think this is one of the global lessons

859
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,960
learned and probably there's another

860
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,520
thing

861
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,520
and please allow me to

862
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,359
allow me to because i'm so bored of

863
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,280
hungarian internal politics that i

864
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,960
rather like to talk about the global

865
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
things and not hungarian internal

866
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,520
politics

867
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,359
but again as far as cities are concerned

868
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,200
it is during the pandemic

869
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,720
we learned to value the most important

870
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,599
asset of the city which is public spaces

871
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,520
it turned out during the pandemic

872
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,720
that everyone needs more public space

873
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,640
it is the catering the caterers would

874
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,640
like to open terraces

875
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,400
the mother with a small kid would like

876
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,000
to have place for the

877
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,040
uh for the straw to push the kid

878
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,720
the grandmother would like to have a

879
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,560
tree which has a shadow where you can

880
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,880
sit under and you can be on open air

881
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,520
and these demands cannot be met at the

882
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,480
same time

883
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,599
so we need to just strike a priority

884
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,839
how to use our public spaces and what to

885
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,640
do with them

886
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,320
shall we just turn our cities into

887
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,480
parking lots or shall we turn our cities

888
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,760
into parks

889
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,520
now this is two different things and

890
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,359
this is a major division

891
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,280
and here you need a lot of discussion a

892
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,640
lot of empathy

893
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,520
but i think people start to feel how

894
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,720
high the stake is

895
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
concerning the public spaces of cities

896
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,000
and i'm sure in certain that

897
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,440
the cities of the world will have to be

898
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,200
greener and that requires

899
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,880
space okay and i just want to take

900
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,320
we're fast running out of time now but

901
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,359
this is a really interesting question

902
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,599
that we've got over the globe set

903
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,640
app which is about how a city's

904
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,520
better place to to make the the changes

905
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,880
necessary to battle

906
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,040
for example the climate crisis than

907
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,320
national authorities

908
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,280
you know is there a lot more

909
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,119
collaboration that can happen between

910
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:51,920
you

911
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,359
all three of you here today may be

912
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,800
speaking on a more regular basis sharing

913
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,680
experience with

914
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,000
other mayors as well should should this

915
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,320
be a platform for combating major global

916
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,480
crises

917
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,079
and maybe matosh i can start with you on

918
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,319
that

919
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,280
i mean uh it's very important to say

920
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
that uh

921
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,560
the cities and and mayors are more

922
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
countable so so it's mean we are more

923
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,760
closer to people

924
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,640
it already was said and of course it's

925
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,160
the things are

926
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,480
we are i don't want to say we are maybe

927
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,760
under the big pressure because

928
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,480
it's true but if i promise that

929
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,920
something must be done

930
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,880
or i'm going to deliver something people

931
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,160
just want

932
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,480
just that i can meet them on the streets

933
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,160
they can ask me on the street

934
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,040
if the things are done and and and this

935
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,119
is just a small scale of the

936
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,000
of maybe for the bigger solution to the

937
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,359
big problem of climate change for

938
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,319
example

939
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:53,119
we uh and i think all other mayors

940
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,520
and also the mayors from our park the

941
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,400
free cities

942
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,839
which uh girl founded uh

943
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,680
we have we are sharing the same

944
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,359
experience uh

945
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,440
we cannot do a false or empty promises

946
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,160
that's the main thing we we if we are

947
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,839
promising something we need to deliver

948
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,000
that and that's the the small in a small

949
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,480
scale

950
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,800
solution which must of course go to the

951
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,359
bigger scale

952
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,240
great thank you and vit so it's very

953
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,480
easy so i think the cooperation and the

954
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,119
sharing

955
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,160
of good practice uh it's one it's also

956
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,640
one of the very positive results of this

957
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,680
covet crisis

958
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,720
because all mayors were communicated it

959
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,599
wasn't

960
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,800
important from which part they they are

961
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,839
the cooperation was very close

962
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:44,720
uh it's the experience from the czech

963
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,599
republic

964
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,000
and it was something what i really

965
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,680
missed at the very beginning

966
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,720
of my mayor's career it was

967
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,000
in the corporation and

968
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,359
i was 32 years old without

969
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:02,480
experience with politics and i

970
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,319
always try to find some information

971
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,599
and some possibility how to share

972
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,680
the good information and do good

973
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,800
practice with

974
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,359
my colleagues and it's in the small

975
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:17,040
things in the cities we can discuss

976
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,839
together

977
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,880
about by clients in the cities but also

978
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,119
about the big challenges for the future

979
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,599
climate change and so on so the good

980
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,720
practice sharing

981
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,839
is the future and go yeah in budapest

982
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,119
do you think there should be a lot more

983
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,960
collaboration between city mayors across

984
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,400
europe maybe even beyond

985
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,560
to figure out ways to to battle the

986
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,079
crisis all cities are facing

987
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,000
and you know and hidalgo in paris talks

988
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,599
about the 15-minute city a lot

989
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,440
is this an interesting proposal for you

990
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,839
guys as well

991
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,480
you can um you have a new day in

992
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,880
well yes during the pandemic very very

993
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,119
scarce information coming from the

994
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,880
central authorities was very scarce we

995
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,240
hardly got any information from the

996
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,440
central government

997
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,560
but we got a lot of information

998
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,400
from other mayors from europe and

999
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,599
outside europe as well

1000
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,200
there were good practices and best

1001
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,720
practices that we could adopt

1002
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,400
and we also saw that we are not left

1003
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,160
alone because all the other cities were

1004
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,839
suffering of the same problems

1005
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,839
and this was a very very important for

1006
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:21,440
all city leaders

1007
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,200
and i think that the cities really just

1008
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,000
managed to share experience and this was

1009
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,920
not about party politics uh this was

1010
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,280
beyond party politics

1011
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,319
and also climate change accommodation uh

1012
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:34,960
social

1013
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,680
exclusion these are problems that

1014
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,520
accumulate in big cities

1015
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,000
and we can only be effective in fighting

1016
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,359
these problems and

1017
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,079
and encountering these problems if we

1018
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:46,960
work together

1019
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,720
and we share our experiences so the

1020
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,520
the city governance so local governments

1021
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,359
and municipal municipalities should be

1022
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:56,560
the pillars of these

1023
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,280
fights so i think the european union the

1024
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,240
right thing to do

1025
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,280
would be to consider the cities to be an

1026
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,280
important level of decision making

1027
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,640
obviously the european union is

1028
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,880
primarily an alliance of countries of

1029
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,440
nation

1030
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,800
nations states but again crisis

1031
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,400
management is more effective on the city

1032
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,160
level on the local level the municipal

1033
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:16,560
level

1034
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,880
and not only because problems do come on

1035
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,680
these

1036
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,720
levels but also because uh

1037
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,279
in these

1038
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,480
settlements there is a much more support

1039
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,760
for

1040
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,599
the measures against these global

1041
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,960
problems because

1042
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,359
city inhabitants feel these problems on

1043
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,040
their very skin

1044
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,680
so i think local economy local politics

1045
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,280
local communities

1046
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,440
this is going to be the better and nice

1047
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,560
new future

1048
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,240
uh the building of which is one of the

1049
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,000
topic of this conference so i think

1050
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,920
locality has to play an important role

1051
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,000
in this better future

1052
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,920
okay thanks and we have got about a

1053
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,599
minute and 10 seconds left so

1054
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,040
i'm going to put each of the three of

1055
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,960
you on the spot and ask you

1056
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,640
to do a little pitch for your own city

1057
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,880
in 15 20 seconds specifically telling

1058
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,680
everybody externally what what your city

1059
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,480
has done right

1060
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,560
and how best to build back better from

1061
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
the pandemic matush i'll put you on the

1062
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,560
spot first

1063
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,079
so what we did right right that's the

1064
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,319
question uh

1065
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,760
i mean it's always difficult to talk

1066
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,680
about what we did right other people

1067
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,960
should tell it

1068
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,400
let's tell this but i'm sure we

1069
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,839
we today bratislava is a city

1070
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,280
uh which 50 percent of each citizen with

1071
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,240
vaccine

1072
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,560
we have more than 75 percent of our

1073
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,520
elderly people

1074
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,480
also vaccinated we did a campaign we did

1075
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,359
two campaign

1076
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,280
and i think we did it right uh the first

1077
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,720
one was the

1078
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,440
the the our only vaccine is discipline

1079
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,000
the second

1080
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,440
one is uh it's the time to hack again

1081
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,520
of course and now we're doing a campaign

1082
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,599
for vaccination which is important we

1083
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,000
maintain a good level of communication

1084
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,520
we were able to manage

1085
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,880
the crisis for the citizen who

1086
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,800
we are taking care of of this group

1087
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,400
people i i talk

1088
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,760
already before and uh we what we do

1089
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,040
what is what is new for us that we uh

1090
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,440
make a new relationship with private

1091
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,319
businesses

1092
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,800
with big private businesses for ikea at

1093
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,720
one of the biggest slovak banks

1094
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,119
and and we're building uh on it and we

1095
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,240
continue to co

1096
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,400
cooperate with them thank you thank you

1097
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,079
we're now stealing time so vit i'm gonna

1098
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,119
have to just uh

1099
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,720
get you to give us one sentence as

1100
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,960
opposed to 15 seconds and same for you

1101
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,240
okay the most important thing was the

1102
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,920
community encouragement

1103
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,079
it was the biggest success okay thank

1104
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,839
you and good yeah

1105
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,119
this is an open frank

1106
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,920
uh communication that considered the

1107
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,800
citizens as

1108
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,640
adults and included them so

1109
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,400
participative and inclusion population

1110
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,920
which is very important in the crisis i

1111
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,440
think we did this right

1112
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,040
although we also probably made mistakes

1113
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,680
as well thank you very much and i very

1114

1115
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,560
discipline is our only vaccine that's uh

1116
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,000
