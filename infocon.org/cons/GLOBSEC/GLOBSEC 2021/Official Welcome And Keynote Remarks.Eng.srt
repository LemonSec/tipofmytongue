objective difficulties

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,720
due to the coronavirus pandemic or in

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,159
spite of the korean virus pandemic we

30

in brussels

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
in order to discuss the important

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,560
problems but also about the future

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,439
especially

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,079
also in the context of what we have just

38
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,040
heard

39
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
from his holiness

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,920
all of us hope that the pandemic is

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,840
coming to an end

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,280
and that right now is the moment

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,759
to talk

44
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
about the challenges which are awaiting

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,159
us

46
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,399
but also to draw conclusions

47
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
draw conclusions from what has happened

48
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,480
over the last year or so

49
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,680
things that have affected us why

50
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,680
were we not able to prevent certain

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,000
things

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
we have achieved thanks to a common

53
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,560
effort thanks to solidarity

54
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
thanks to cooperation thanks to mutual

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,879
better

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,959
we understanding think about what we

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,040
will be able to prevent in the future

58
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,599
we ourselves all future generations

59
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,200
although i do hope that they will never

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,400
be confronted with

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,319
such a challenge thank you very much for

62
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,840
inviting me to this

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
important conference the topic of which

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,000
is so

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
strictly connected with the global

66
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
problems the problems of our origin

67
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,480
especially in this particular moment

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,359
which i just mentioned

69
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
physical participation in this event

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,519
would not have been possible

71
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,239
if it was not for the security given to

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:08,879
us by

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,120
huge efforts of medical personnel and

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,239
months

75
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,480
of sacrifice connected with numerous

76
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,680
restrictions

77
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,959
which i hope

78
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
and i'm saying this not only in this

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,760
particular speech i'm having now because

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,799
this is the question

81
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,640
that we are asking ourselves in our

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,720
inofficial conversations

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,599
in the so-called bilateral formula

84
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,879
there's a question that also we the

85
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,720
presidents of the states are asking

86
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,000
these were the topics of the

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,519
conversations yesterday with the

88
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,959
president of the prime ministers

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,519
and these have also been the topics of

90
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,280
the conversations we have had today

91
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,879
can we say that if the number

92
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,080
of cases in my country in poland

93
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
has now dropped

94
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,560
which we recorded exactly one year ago

95
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
that is between 200 and 400 cases every

96
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
day

97
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,560
does that really mean that we can be

98
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,560
happy

99
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
and say that this is the effect of the

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
vaccination or

101
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,880
is it the consequence of the conditions

102
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
of the atmospheric conditions that we're

103
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
seeing right now the weather conditions

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
this is the season in which we are now

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
last year we didn't have

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
the vaccination yet and we had the same

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,199
number of cases

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,759
nevertheless

109
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,000
optimistically those two elements have

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,040
come together

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
on the one hand there is the ongoing

112
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
vaccination process

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
in poland

114
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,639
we have already vaccinated almost 25

115
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,840
million doses 25 million doses have been

116
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
distributed

117
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,960
which means there is a quite big share

118
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
of the population which has received at

119
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,199
least one

120
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
shot of the vaccine however all of us

121
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,639
hope this vaccination

122
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,479
will wipe out the coronavirus pandemic

123
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
but of course unfortunately the question

124
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,080
remains

125
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,520
whether it's going to be fully efficient

126
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,720
this is the question that

127
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,479
we are still awaiting and of course the

128
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,600
answer to this question is something

129
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,240
that we have to wait

130
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
let me draw your attention to the fact

131
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,000
that there are a few phenomena

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,479
in the world which would have such a

133
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,960
common

134
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,520
this small pathogen has attacked the

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,800
whole world

136
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,199
affecting not only the public health but

137
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,000
inflicting

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
death and suffering that first and

139
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,280
foremost

140
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,120
it shook the social sense of security

141
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
it shook the foundations of the global

142
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,800
economy

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,960
no society and no economy

144
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,800
have been able to resist that crisis

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
in this context i can

146
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,840
underline with full conviction and very

147
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,120
resolutely that the only

148
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,880
successful strategy for the

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
post-pandemic

150
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,400
recovery of the world including our

151
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,960
region the region of central europe

152
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,240
is the one which foresees what i have

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
already said at the outset of my speech

154
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,120
global solidarity global understanding

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,840
and global cooperation is the

156
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
precondition

157
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
and its consequences the recovery of

158
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,840
economists is going to be much more

159
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
difficult

160
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,880
global economic organism is not fully

161
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,919
recovered

162
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,520
that is why solidarity also in sharing

163
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,840
access to vaccines

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
is a fundamental importance in the fight

165
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,319
against the coronavirus pandemic

166
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
ladies and gentlemen the leaders are

167
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,240
currently facing huge challenges

168
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
first of all they have to take care of

169
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,199
the well-being of the societies which

170
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,400
they represent

171
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,360
they have to go above particularistic

172
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
interests and find themselves the

173
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,240
readiness to demonstrate solidarity

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,759
has to be avoiding of new divisions into

175
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,400
the better

176
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,280
and worse ones into the richer and the

177
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,240
poorer ones

178
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
into those vaccinated and those not

179
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,680
vaccinated

180
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,120
this is our common fight which requires

181
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,080
revisiting fundamental values christian

182
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,160
values

183
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,599
which have just been mentioned in a

184
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,160
beautiful way by his holiness

185
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
pope francis

186
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,319
we need to think about humanistic roots

187
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,680
which are so important to all of us

188
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
the second fundamental challenge we're

189
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,639
facing is acknowledging the paradigm

190
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,360
of unavoidability to confront problems

191
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,000
which

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,319
existed also before the outbreak of the

193
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,360
pandemic

194
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,440
and which have not gone away that's

195
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,719
obvious

196
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,919
let us just look at the neighborhood

197
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,799
in the european union russia is

198
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,320
continuing its actions

199
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,360
and it has announced further steps of

200
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,080
the character of

201
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
imperial pressure it interferes into

202
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
internal affairs of other states

203
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
it violates the financial foundations of

204
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,839
international law also vis-a-vis its own

205
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
citizens

206
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,680
and increasingly unpredictable actions

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,279
of the belarusian regime

208
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,640
we have got the oppression

209
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,920
we have got the uh limitation of any

210
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,399
kind

211
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,920
of civic freedom we have got people in

212
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,880
prisons

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,920
since 2018 the destabilized libya

214
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,800
is an arena of war operations and the

215
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,440
target of

216
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,519
hybrid actions the countries in the

217
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,800
south of europe

218
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,519
for many years have been struggling with

219
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440
the ongoing migration crisis

220
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,839
constitutes a permanent threat

221
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,040
uh the global fighting of the virus

222
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
or defeating the virus but let us also

223
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
remember about other

224
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,480
illnesses such as authoritarianism

225
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,640
imperialism a violation of international

226
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,680
law and human rights

227
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
these are realistic problems which did

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
exist before the pandemic

229
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,839
distinguished guests

230
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,560
values are a fundamental thing however

231
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
let us not forget that while talking

232
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,839
about security we also need to talk

233
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,600
about the costs

234
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,320
security is an investment and in this

235
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,519
very context

236
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,959
economy is of key importance fast

237
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,920
recovery of the economies affected by

238
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,720
the crisis

239
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
is very important but what is even more

240
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,240
important is the model

241
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,720
of such recovery the post-pandemic

242
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,680
economic

243
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,040
order has to adopt as its departure

244
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,640
on the one hand coming back to the path

245
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
of dynamic growth on the other hand

246
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,279
however

247
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,040
resilience however first and foremost

248
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,200
i would like to express my conviction

249
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,560
that

250
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,200
these two factors have to be correlated

251
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,839
with one another

252
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,800
for i have no doubt whatsoever that the

253
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,120
growth

254
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,279
in other words the improvement of

255
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,720
economic situation

256
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
the improvement of the welfare of the

257
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
societies by the same token is going to

258
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,519
build

259
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,320
resilience in order to obtain this

260
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
resilience in order to equip

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,200
our economies with tools which are going

262
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
to

263
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,040
amortize the future possible effects on

264
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,240
future economic shocks

265
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,720
we have to revise our so far way of

266
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,600
thinking

267
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,160
about the network of global financial

268
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,480
interdependencies trade and investment

269
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,680
interdependencies

270
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,519
alike the discussion concerning these

271
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,160
problems is in the pipeline and it's

272
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,760
very well known

273
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,440
the conclusion is from our so far

274
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
experiences and let me just remind you

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,399
that this has been the second global

276
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,240
crisis that has affected us in the last

277
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,680
10 years or so

278
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,760
have been accounted for in the european

279
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,399
recovery instrument next generation eu

280
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,639
as well as international

281
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,639
recovery plans developed by member

282
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,560
states this is important

283
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
that in the public debates there is a

284
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,600
thinking

285
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,560
about the need to give an impulse to

286
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,839
stimulate a production within the

287
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,440
european union

288
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,760
the effects of which will also be the

289
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,639
shortening of

290
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,519
supply chains which on the other hand

291
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,760
will generate more security

292
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,120
i wrote about it in a letter which i

293
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,560
addressed to european leaders more than

294
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,360
one year ago

295
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
and i'm happy that a lot of

296
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,360
please from that letter today constitute

297
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
the content of the european union's plan

298
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,160
developed to recover after the pandemic

299
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,279
i'm also happy

300
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,480
that we express care for future

301
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
generations this is expressed among

302
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,279
others by

303
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,800
sustainable approach to climate policy

304
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,279
taking into account elements of social

305
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,959
and development policy

306
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,959
in other words something that we have

307
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,320
called just transition

308
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,040
i have no doubt whatsoever that the

309
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
recovery model adopted by poland

310
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,680
based on a broad scale program of

311
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,639
infrastructure

312
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,920
public investments investments in the

313
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,320
private sector profound

314
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
energy and digital transformation and

315
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
better effectiveness and accessibility

316
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,120
of the public

317
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
sector of the public health services

318
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,240
will

319
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
generate a new economic architecture and

320
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,000
architecture which will

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,200
allow us to develop further

322
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,920
in an unlimited way at the same time my

323
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,560
homeland

324
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,199
will be resilient to the future possible

325
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,920
global shocks

326
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,399
i would like to stress very powerfully

327
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
that this is the priority leading my

328
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,399
second term in office as president

329
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,600
which was called

330
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,680
dude in the last year's presidential

331
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
campaign and today

332
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
it makes part of the polish governmental

333
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,360
program

334
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
which is described as a new order

335
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,720
or finally as a polish order

336
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,760
a big enthusiasm is reflected among

337
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,720
others by objective analysis last week

338
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,920
the world bank has revised

339
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,199
the gdp of poland the foreign caste is

340
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,800
now 3.8 this year

341
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
and 4.5 in 2022

342
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,320
a similar opinion has been expressed

343
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,920
also by the european commission which in

344
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,560
mid

345
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,360
may increased the assessed dynamics of

346
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
growth of poland

347
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,839
up to four percent of gdp in 2021

348
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,600
and up to 5.4 percent in 2022.

349
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
this model will also make part of a

350
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,440
broader recovery plan

351
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,199
thanks to which our region is going to

352
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,760
be one of the most robustly developing

353
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,480
ones

354
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,959
the expected growth of gdp in central

355
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,680
europe

356
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
is supposed to amount to four point six

357
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,920
percent in the nearest future

358
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,240
all of us that is foreign

359
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,639
the essential question of this debate

360
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,480
namely if there is any

361
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,800
unique extraordinary way for the

362
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,320
countries of our region to

363
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,360
recover post pandemic

364
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,680
i can say with full conviction and full

365
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,639
responsibility

366
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,399
yes i do believe there is such a path

367
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,639
not just for one state of the region for

368
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,600
the states

369
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,880
of the region as a certain community

370
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,920
as an element of a

371
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,759
big community that is of the european

372
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,160
union

373
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
this plan i'm referring to this idea

374
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,440
this path

375
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,680
i believe is the three cities initiative

376
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,880
which is the format of regional

377
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,360
cooperation

378
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,120
which is complementary to the european

379
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,639
union integration and

380
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,440
which speaks about tightening strategic

381
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
cooperation

382
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,600
across the atlantic we are lucky

383
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,959
that this area we are talking about

384
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,639
central europe is inhabited by nations

385
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,880
who are extraordinarily ambitious

386
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,600
hardworking and creative by nature

387
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,279
nations which have gone through many

388
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,560
experiences nations are not afraid of

389
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,000
challenges

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,639
we want to harness this positive energy

391
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,120
which is

392
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,519
permeating the entire 36 region the

393
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,040
initiative is developing

394
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
we are equipping it with ever newer

395
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,040
instruments and mechanisms

396
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,759
which define its subsequent

397
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,000
functionalities and give it the veiler

398
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
valor of full maturity currently the

399
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
most important

400
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,440
tool which supports its aims is the free

401
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,639
sys investment fund

402
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,800
thanks to which we have started to

403
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,839
co-finance

404
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
projects on the regional scale however

405
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,560
there are also other tools

406
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,600
ce plus index

407
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,199
3cs region forum combined with

408
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,119
the economic congress as well as the

409
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,280
three seas business forum organized

410
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,799
every year in the marriages of the

411
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,359
subsequent summits

412
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,240
we can see a big interest in cooperation

413
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,919
with the three cities initiative on part

414
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,439
of their external partners

415
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,599
japan greece great britain

416
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,160
not to mention that our strategic

417
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,199
partners

418
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,360
for many years now right from the

419
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,880
inception we can say

420
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
have been european institutions the

421
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,480
united states of america

422
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,120
and germany germany

423
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,320
developed country from the

424
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,919
infrastructure point of view not only in

425
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,280
the european union but across

426
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,919
the whole europe one of the absolutely

427
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,400
best

428
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
developed countries if not the best

429
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
developed country in the world

430
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,360
i profoundly believe in the sense of

431
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,440
this cooperation i consider it the

432
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,280
thrist's initiative

433
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,679
to be the most representative formula of

434
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,280
deeper integration of the countries of

435
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,000
our region within the european union

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,480
and as the best way to strengthen the

437
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,520
transatlantic bond

438
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,120
in this context it's worth stressing

439
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
that all the three strategic

440
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,039
goals of the initiative the development

441
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,799
of infrastructure energy and

442
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,679
digital infrastructure are inextricably

443
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,200
connect connected with security

444
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,559
strong economically and well integrated

445
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,840
region is able

446
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,880
to tackle in the situation during future

447
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,760
crisis

448
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
let us hope we are not confronted with

449
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,360
any future crisis nevertheless we have

450
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,120
to be prepared always and i do believe

451
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,720
that we are going to be prepared thank

452
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,840

453
