panelists to discuss this today

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360

german council on foreign relations we

17

we talk a lot about it in brussels but i

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,280
think we are missing a lot of the

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,039
perspective from this region

21
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,640
and we have some excellent speakers

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
today to tackle this

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,080
i think everybody is aware that for the

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
european commission right now

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,240
digitization is a very high priority one

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
of the top two priorities in fact

27
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,799
uh and president usually lion declared

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,360
this the digital decade

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
the commission itself has released

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,759
something called the digital compass

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,119
which had four points as compasses do

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,400
and basically outlined you know what

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
or excuse me what europe would like to

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
see happen in the next 10 years and

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,600
and those points are digitally

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,720
increasing a digitally skilled

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,560
population and a highly skilled

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
digital professional workforce uh secure

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
and substantial digital infrastructure

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079

41
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,840
transformation of business

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,479
and the fourth is digitization of public

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,399
sector and of course you have to put

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,000
your money where your mouth is and

covid19 global downturn

148
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,240
we see that rapid recovery boosts are

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,600
needed to stabilize

crisis

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
and during the crisis we saw that

157
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,199
digital technologies are very essential

158
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,320
in responding to the worldwide crisis we

159
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
flexible homework and so on uh

161
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,120

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,039
century much stronger and in fact

168
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,120
more competitive the european union has

169
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
encouraged

in their national menus and slovakia in

175
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
slovakia

176
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,240
we prepare a strong digital package

177
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,080
component of the recovery plan

178
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,039
which will bring positive impact on our

179
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:41,919
society

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,639
lifestyle work opportunities as well as

181
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,840
environment

182
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,840
so we placed the digital components

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,960
really in the core of our our

184
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,240
recovery plan and uh

185
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
our digital computer component is

186
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,360
focusing on four

187
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,759
areas the first one is digital

188
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,720
infrastructure

189
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,000
so to improve digital infrastructure and

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,759
connectivity

191
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,880
digital public services cyber security

192
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,080
of course

193
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,720
and this is the transformation of small

194
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,199
and

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,400
medium-sized businesses uh

196
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,639
while deploying top digital solutions

197
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,639
across the country

198
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,080
uh the key elements of our reform

199
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,280
are digital economy innovation bringing

200
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,880
notable added value to digital

201
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,199
competitiveness of slovakia

202
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
and most important most important

203
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,280
investments will target two domains

204
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
we specifically will invest into

205
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,520
increasing our participation in

206
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,360
multi-country projects so we want to

207
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
cooperate with other

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,759
european and regional partners of the

209
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,280
european union

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,160
and to create subsidy schemes to support

211
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,639
a project that develops and implement

212
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,759
top digital technologies

213
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,680
i'm convinced that slovakia will be

214
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
reliable partner in terms of

215
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,759
building a stronger europe as far as

216
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,400
the pantemia is concerned kovit 19

217
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,000
pushed

218
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,199
digitization everywhere and

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,080
on the national level what we need now

220
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,199
is the

221
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,080
right government action to accelerate

222
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,520
productivity

223
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,400
digitize across all sectors of the

224
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,000
economy and encourage innovation

225
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
the central investment in this area is

226
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,719
the subsidy schemes we are creating to

227
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,360
support

228
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,479
research development application of top

229
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
digital technologies with the use of

230
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
public and business sector and

231
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,680
scientific

232
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,880
research institutions the

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
technologies that we will support

234
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
willing include mainly

235
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,640
high performance computing quantum

236
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,600
technologies

237
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,880
uh artificial intelligence internet of

238
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,320
things and many other

239
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,440
advanced technology and this scheme

240
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,839
also will be the tool to co-finance

241
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,760
projects successful in the european

242
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,720
union

243
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
uh directly manage programs such as

244
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
horizon digital europe or connecting

245
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
europe facility and to

246
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,480
to bring in a national investment so

247
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,959
these are the main plans for

248
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,480
a digital component uh in slovakia

249
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,760
and uh i hope that we can

250
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,120
we can achieve uh real progress in

251
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
digital transformation of slovakia

252
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,480
in i would say a few years thank you so

253
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,000
much uh madame prime uh

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,440
deputy prime minister uh minister

255
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,519
uh the deputy prime minister mentioned a

256
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,640
lot of different

257
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,560
uh initiatives and you know coming from

258
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,000
germany watching some of the other

259
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,200
countries in the eu

260
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,959
you hear about a lot of these kind of

261
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,720
initiatives but how

262
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
are smaller countries including yours in

263
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
estonia making sure that they are

264
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
embedded in an integrated process that

265
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,800
they are dealing with

266
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
multi-country projects and that this

267
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,920
moment of let's say

268
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,240
tech industrial policy doesn't end up

269
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,440
being nationally based

270
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,920
this is a very right angle i think if we

271
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,800
collectively

272
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,279
in europe want to succeed when you

273
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,480
really need to work

274
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
but we have a shared one single market

275
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
including in digital domain

276
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
and if anything what kovid has

277
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
demonstrated

278
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,000
we certainly are facing

279
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
the most digital year and a half

280
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,839
in in terms of uh i mean throughout the

281
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,800
society

282
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,120
and i think there are a couple of uh

283
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,160
areas where we

284
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,720
we really need to to work upon one

285
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,600
relates to

286
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
digital skill set because in estonia we

287
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,079
have already 99

288
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,320
of the public services available uh

289
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,440
online

290
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,640
and so it's it's really a matter of

291
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,360
of access to these services making all

292
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,200
people educated and

293
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
even though we have that high

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,279
penetration rate we still

295
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,800
have a digital uh skills cap we we need

296
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,680
to close

297
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,839
so we're still 10 15 percent of people

298
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,240
who who for a reason or another

299
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,200
are not the best friends with with a

300
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,399
digital world

301
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,880
so this is where we we see a lot of work

302
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,680
ahead

303
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,839
uh also if we look at the corporate side

304
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,480
when the digitalization is part of

305
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,600
our integral part of a free main

306
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,079
global trends if we talk about digital

307
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,519
digitalization

308
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,079
green transition and also the innovation

309
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,720
drive

310
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
and what we push here very strongly is

311
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,480
is really to uh to improve a

312
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,560
collaboration between

313
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,120
the universities and businesses so there

314
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
will be more research and development

315
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,720
more applied research so that we can

316
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
actually move up the value chain and and

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
again here i think

318
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,920
the size of the individual country it it

319
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,680
does matter but

320
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,480
but i come back to uh to what i said in

321
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,760
the beginning

322
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,720
we really need to make sure that that

323
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,440
europe

324
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,480
as a whole is functioning without the

325
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,519
borders

326
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,639
uh and relatedly i think uh also deputy

327
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,160
prime minister may mention cyber

328
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,279
security

329
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
if we look uh on the amount of funding

330
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
uh what we

331
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,560
get into the digital domain uh in in

332
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,200
europe

333
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,079
through different european funds which

334
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,160
is about 130 billion

335
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,120
and this and then we top it up with a

336
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,079
private investment

337
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,600
it's obvious we need heavy uh investment

338
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,320
in

339
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,200
in cyber security otherwise we develop

340
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,480
new services

341
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,959
new products becoming increasingly more

342
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,680
digital

343
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,079
but if we don't top up the investment in

344
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,839
cyber security we will also become

345
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
increasingly vulnerable and we see

346
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,600
a fairly rapid rise of of

347
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,360
different type of cyber attacks which

348
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
are becoming increasingly sophisticated

349
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,000
uh targeting both public and private

350
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
private companies

351
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
so these are i think uh important

352
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,560
domains where we we need to

353
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,839
to continue the work before i move on to

354
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,519
uh minister kurt nick

355
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,639
uh minister you mentioned the the

356
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,200
issue of cross-border markets and making

357
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,639
sure that the digital single market is

358
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,360
complete

359
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,880
what grade would you give the digital

360
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,639
signal market in its completion right

361
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
now

362
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
do you see it is coming we are still i

363
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,839
mean i think we are still fragmented

364
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,519
i mean that's that's obvious i wouldn't

365
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,920
put a specific uh percentage in it but i

366
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,800
mean if you

367
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,360
if you look on the digital services uh

368
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,240
what could be

369
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,600
uh applied across the union

370
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,079
i mean we are not we are not that far

371
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,680
yet and also i think it's

372
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,000
very uneven across the member states

373
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,360
what is the number

374
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,760
of uh digital services available either

375
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,440
in a public domain or in a private

376
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,160
domain

377
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
but i think what is really important is

378
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,440
the interoperability of a different

379
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,519
public services so if i'm a citizen of

380
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,480
estonia

381
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,760
we have the secure eid so i would have

382
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,000
an access to public services which are

383
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
digital in

384
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,000
in germany or in belgium or in uh in

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,680
in slovak republic i think there is a

386
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,680
huge uh

387
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,920
upside in in this process if we if we

388
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
can

389
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,399
if we can advance because if we only

390
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,199
develop

391
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,760
our own

392
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,160
states then globally we all will be

393
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:38,959
small

394
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,920
if we want to be in a leader's position

395
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
we need to talk about half a billion

396
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,079
people

397
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,760
or almost half a billion people living

398
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,839
in europe uh

399
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,760
being the most digital uh most

400
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,000
innovative uh

401
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,199
and also open open for talent uh open

402
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,920
for business

403
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,839
i think these are important domains

404
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,360
regardless of the size

405
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
of individual country and if we look i

406
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,040
mean we have seven unicorns

407
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,000
in estonia none of them would actually

408
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,760
be come to existence if they would have

409
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,959
targeted only

410
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,279
the market of estonia so with this

411
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,320
global uh

412
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,880
ambition and uh and again hepatitis to

413
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,399
take risk i think these are important

414
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,600
factors

415
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,839
seven unicorns in estonia is definitely

416
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,920
an enviable number for a country

417
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
uh the size of estonia i i think all

418
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,240
european even germany i think or france

419
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,760
would wish they had seven unicorns

420
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,560
frankly

421
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,320
um minister uh koritnik uh

422
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
slovenia is about to take over uh the

423
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,720
leadership of this uh half a billion

424
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,320
person block lots of consumers

425
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,480
what are the european council presidency

426
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,079
priorities for slovenia

427
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,000
in the digital and tech space

428
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,199
thank you very much for for the question

429
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,040
and the opportunity to

430
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,120
be here among renowned experts

431
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,320
and colleagues our presidency strongly

432
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
uh supports digitalization and digital

433
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,320
transformation of the society

434
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,160
and of course the development of

435
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,000
advanced technologies

436
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,639
uh the intensive process of digital

437
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,560
transformation for companies

438
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,800
to be fit for the fourth industrial

439
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,759
revolution

440
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,360
should support the implementation of

441
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,040
advanced technologies

442
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,160
artificial intelligence big data

443
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,639
internet of things and of course

444
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,000
blockchain

445
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,199
digitalization for me is uh mere

446
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,639
technology and techniques

447
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,360
but digital transformation is changing

448
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,399
the culture

449
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,079
and embeds the digitalization if we want

450
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,440
to succeed

451
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,480
we should firstly build trust and

452
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,680
digitization

453
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,399
with a safe environment for citizens and

454
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,600
businesses

455
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,519
ensure the availability of digital

456
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,600
infrastructure and services

457
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,759
also the construction of high-speed

458
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,920
broadband and 5g networks

459
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,279
needs to be accelerated thirdly

460
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,440
ensure accessibility of infrastructure

461
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,360
and services

462
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,480
enhance digital competences

463
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,039
the education system needs to be adapted

464
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,599
to include the comprehensive development

465
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,799
of digital competences digital skills

466
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,720
should also be made available to people

467
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
in the third age people with

468
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,439
disabilities

469
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,000
and those who are not digitally skilled

470
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,720
we should

471
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,480
live like said on several occasions

472
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,760
no one behind in the eu level

473
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,679
we have several financial supporting

474
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,280
mechanisms for implementing

475
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,160
new technologies recovery and resilience

476
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
plan is the most recent one

477
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,039
and it offers several options to finance

478
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,200
the technologies like 5g

479
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,480
blockchain ai for instance

480
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,000
slovenia is included in three

481
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
cross-border multi-country projects

482
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,080
uh one is euro cloud so european common

483
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,400
data infrastructure and services

484
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,080
uh european blockchain service

485
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,720
infrastructure and the third is

486
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,679
project on common european interest

487
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,960
semiconductors

488
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
and microchips thank you

489
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,360
all right thank you mr minister uh

490
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,520
ambassador froman

491

the minister mentioned some some

492
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,720
cross-border projects that uh

493
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,559
that slovenia is currently engaged in in

494
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,000
three areas that i think are of great

495
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,520
interest to europe right now for its

496
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,280
geostrategic competitiveness

497
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,039
and its positioning for the future uh

498
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,640
cloud blockchain

499
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,919
and and uh semiconductors and we just

500
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,120
had this week uh

501
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,000
president biden make his first trip to

502
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,640

503
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,600
to europe had a the first u.s eu summit

504
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,080
since 2014 since i believe you were in

505
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,120
in in office at ustr uh what is your

506
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
assessment of how the united states can

507
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,000
play a role

508
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
in the digitization of central and

509
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,919
eastern europe and also of europe

510
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,000
in its in its totality and how do you

511
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
assess the the launch of this new trade

512
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,120
and tech council

513
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,600
well i think it's a very positive move

514
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,960
to bring

515
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,880
us together across the atlantic

516
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,039
like-minded countries to look at

517
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,679
the issues around data and and

518
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,559
technology

519
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,039
and we won't agree on everything but i

520
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,160
think we're actually going to be

521
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,799
end up being much closer to our each

522
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:15,919
other's perspectives

523
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,720
than we are to alternative perspectives

524
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,320
that are out there and so

525
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,960
you saw the g7 they announced a future

526
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,080
tech forum and

527
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,640
as you've mentioned the us eu the

528
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,160
technology council

529
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
those are good mechanisms to really

530
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,080
address these issues like

531
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,440
privacy data flows sovereignty

532
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,880
and making sure that we're working

533
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,039
together i'd say as well

534
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,480
it's not just an issue for governments

535
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
it's an issue for the private sector

536
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,799
and there's a lot of work we can do

537
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,480
we're working with about 100 governments

538
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,679
around the world

539
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,120
including through digital country

540
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,720
partnerships to

541
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
introduce technology help them with

542
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
their data strategies

543
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
figure out how to benefit make sure that

544
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,240
the digital

545
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,160
transformation that's happening benefits

546
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,000
the society particularly

547
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,240
i would say small businesses who you

548
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,760
know in the context of covid we all

549
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,159
learn

550
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
just how critical it is to be part of

551
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
the digital economy whether you're an

552
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,799
individual

553
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,919
getting a disbursement from your

554
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,840
government or a small business needing

555
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,760
to stay in touch with your customers

556
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,240
and suppliers and so we've been working

557
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,960
with with

558
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,480
governments from france the czech

559
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,799
republic elsewhere

560
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,159
in europe to see how to prepare

561
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,960
smes for the digital economy and make

562
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,240
sure they've got

563
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,120
the tools the training the access

564
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,960
necessary to take advantage

565
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,880
of the opportunities that that provides

566
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
so i think it's a public issue it's a

567
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,880
private sector issue and really where

568
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,320
public-private partnerships

569
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,480
can come together to help this

570
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,440
transformation

571
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,280
succeed as the previous speakers

572
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,720
mentioned it's going to be

573
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,799
to the benefit of the european public

574
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,440
and european business sector

575
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
i mean that's definitely something that

576
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,799
we saw in this this coveted time the

577
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,320
great accelerator i mean there was a lot

578
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,360
of adoption of

579
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,760
of digital solutions by companies large

580
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,120
and small

581
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
jeff one of the goals of the digital

582
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,400
compass is to have

583
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,120
75 percent of european companies using

584
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,280
cloud and edge technology by

585
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,840
uh 2030 and of course most of those

586
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,360
companies are smes we saw a major

587
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,080
adoption uh acceleration boom in the

588
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,720
covid

589
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,159
period but there's also a lot of

590
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,080
ambivalence because there was this

591
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
idea that a lot of that adoption was to

592
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,280
the benefit of non-european companies

593
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,799
how can a company like microsoft

594
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,760
make europe governments and publics feel

595
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
comfortable with

596
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,840
the relationship the interdependence of

597
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,960
u.s and european companies on each other

598
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,039
well picking up on uh michael froman's

599
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,480
comment on your question

600
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,919
tess i would say there has been a

601
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,080
massive acceleration of technology

602
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,400
adoption uh satya nadella our ceo likes

603
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,440
to say that there was

604
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
two years of innovation effectively in

605
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,559
two months and that may well be

606
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,480
an understatement and that i think for

607
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,240
us that microsoft reinforced a couple of

608
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,799
things that

609
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,720
were important one really is the

610
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,000
importance of digital skills

611
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
as the deputy prime minister mentioned

612
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
to the other ministers and so we

613
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,919
did focus on that and how we could

614
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,840
contribute that in that area

615
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,000
about a year plus ago as the pandemic

616
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,679
really began to take hold we committed

617
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,000
to

618
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,960
train 25 million people around the world

619
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,000
within a year

620
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,440
in digital skills in a variety of

621
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,200
different ways focusing on

622
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,640
free training materials but also reduced

623
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,559
discounted certifications uh with

624
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
microsoft technologies and i'm pleased

625
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:30,559
that

626
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,880
after about a year plus we hit 42

627
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,760
million people

628
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,000
actually across the world 2.3 million or

629
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,799
so here

630
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,120
in the region so that's one area where a

631
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
lot has been done a lot more has to be

632
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,400
done if it's going to be opportunity

633
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,799
and to your point in relation to how

634
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,400
technology can be used to facilitate

635
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,520
growth to the european

636
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,720
level we very much focused on what's top

637
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
of mind as people embrace more cloud

638
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,000
services that has been

639
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,400
privacy it has been security it has been

640
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,080
data sovereignty defined to mean

641
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,760
different things by different people and

642
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,120
that does get to this question

643
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,960
of uh the position of american

644
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,400
technology companies relative to

645
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,600
european technology

646
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,159
companies we have very much focused on

647
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,080
what president ursula vonder lyon has

648
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,480
said

649
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,880
when she talks about the need for uh

650
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,880
europe fit for the digital age and for

651
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,720
us that means uh

652
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,360
technology fit for europe so how do we

653
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,480
facilitate growth

654
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
and innovation within the local european

655
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,679
technology

656
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,919
economy one of the ways we've tried to

657
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,200
do that is to respect

658
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,600
european values and expectations around

659
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,640
sovereignty and one of those

660
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,240
expectations increasingly

661
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,720
is that data remains within the european

662
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,760
union

663
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
and so just about a month ago in fact we

664
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,120
announced what we call

665
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,760
uh essentially an eu data boundary for

666
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,120
the microsoft cloud

667
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,960
which is a commitment by microsoft that

668
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,640
all data is going to be stored and

669
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
processed within the european union and

670
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,080
as a technology uh

671
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
company we are most of all platform

672
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,200
provider uh

673
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
allowing companies here in europe who

674
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,640
want to have their data also within the

675
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,400
european union to build upon

676
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
our platform and we're excited about

677
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,880
that development but equally we do live

678
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,120
in a global economy after all and the

679
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,080
internet is

680
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,760
global in nature so we need to find ways

681
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,840
to make sure that data can flow across

682
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,520
borders within europe but also outside

683
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,720
of europe too

684
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,880
and as as ambassador froman uh we're

685
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,480
very encouraged to see what has been

686
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,840
happening in the context of this most

687
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,120
recent visit between

688
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,440
the body administration and and folks

689
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,480
here within the european union

690
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,320
that was an excellent way to start to

691
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,679
open it up for questions

692
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,440
uh great opening statements from our

693
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,600
speakers if you do have any questions

694
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
please use the slido app or

695
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,279
we have an audience here in the room we

696
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,799
will also take questions in the good

697
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,480
old-fashioned way of you asking the

698
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
question in person

699
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,360
but i'm going to kick it off with a

700
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,640
little bit of discussion with the group

701
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,159
because everybody's kind of put a lot of

702
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:45,679
things on the table

703
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,480
and one of the things that was raised by

704
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,840
jeff bullwinkle was this issue of

705
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,039
digital sovereignty

706
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,080
and i'm very interested to know how

707
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,480
central europe sees this concept of

708
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,320
digital sovereignty and where they see

709
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,440
their position

710
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,919
when it's formulated in in in brussels

711
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:02,720
for example

712
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,360
so minister how does how does estonia

713
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,000
interpret

714
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,600
the term digital sovereignty is it a

715
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,279
positive is it a negative where do you

716
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,880
where is estonia placed in that

717
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,799
this is something what uh what we

718
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,640
certainly need

719
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
and so we are all part of a process in

720
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:21,039
defining

721
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,080
what we mean by digital sovereignty uh

722
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,440
that is uh obviously important and and

723
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,720
for us

724
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,080
of course uh it means that we we

725
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,880
we focus really on on the level playing

726
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,520
field

727
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,960
we we will remain and be open as a

728
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,279
trading block

729
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,559
and and i think it's also important uh

730
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
if we talk about uh the possibilities

731
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:47,840
for

732
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,400
uh for our own companies particularly

733
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
smes

734
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,360
that they have uh reasonable access to

735
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,600
different services and platforms

736
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,880
so that that they can equally compete in

737
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,840
in the global market but for me digital

738
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
sovereignty is not really building the

739
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,640
walls i mean it is about

740
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,080
agreeing globally uh what is uh

741
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
what are the rules of the game and and

742
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,760
then uh sticking to

743
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,240
to the rules and uh and of course

744
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
protecting

745
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,760
those who play by the rules and keeping

746
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,640
keeping away

747
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,520
those who actually want to play by a

748
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,880
different

749
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,000
rulebook so but it is again something

750
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,039
what we

751
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,559
we we work jointly in europe regardless

752
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,080
of which corner of the

753
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,120
union we come from so digital

754
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,840
sovereignty

755
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,880
is is playing by the rules um of course

756
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,880
europe is in the process of drafting a

757
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,679
pretty comprehensive rulebook right now

758
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,720
how jeff how does microsoft see uh

759
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,559
this idea of digital sovereignty is just

760
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,240
is is playing by the rules and and

761
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,960
keeping a level playing field

762
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,120
well first of all we are i guess a

763
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,400
technology company that

764
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
perhaps before some others uh recognize

765
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
just how important it is for there to be

766
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,600
more regulation in the area of cloud

767
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,480
services

768
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,799
that's true in relation to ai for

769
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,159
instance and we were

770
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:13,840
early in calling for regulation in that

771
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
space because after all there does need

772
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,159
to be

773
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,559
some sort of form of a fuel regulatory

774
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,520
floor to avoid

775
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,440
a race to the bottom and so we're

776
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,799
watching obviously very close to what's

777
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,320
happening in process as well around

778
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,360
the dma and dsa and dora and so on and

779
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,799
but here too we're seeing i think a

780
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,559
trend toward regulation that's going to

781
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,039
be

782
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,360
balanced and really appropriate in the

783
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,640
context of

784
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,720
um what i think are shared values across

785
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,039
the atlantic and i do think it's helpful

786
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,159
in a forum like this

787
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,679
building upon some of the statements we

788
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,679
heard earlier yesterday and even over

789
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:44,880
dinner last night

790
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,399
i think about what can be done in the

791
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,240
context of transatlantic relations in

792
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,520
terms of a digital

793
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,279
alliance because as was said by one of

794
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,960
the previous speakers there's more in

795
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,080
common

796
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,240
than than not in this respect and are

797
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,679
there things in fact we can do

798
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,840
together to reach more regulatory

799
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,799
cohesion

800
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,440
in the context of democratic values

801
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,200
western values european values and we

802
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,320
certainly focus on that

803
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,360
at microsoft as well

804
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,720
so if if microsoft sees

805
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,880
its role in in just adhering to the

806
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,919
rules in in and

807
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,320
also helped shape this process is that

808
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,360
something that

809
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,399
uh where does central europe play

810
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,840
in that because a lot of these rules are

811
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,240
taking place in in brussels

812
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,120
um minister uh kariza how are you

813
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,559
planning on integrating

814
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,840
more companies into uh setting an agenda

815
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,760
for the slovenian presidency

816
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,559
and how are you planning on making this

817
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,919
this rule book setting

818
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,080
uh part of the priority that will take

819
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,960
place in the next

820
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,840
six months

821
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,200
thank you when it comes to the european

822
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,480
single market

823
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
it is crucial to use the development

824
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,760
opportunities

825
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,559
of ict and the internet to accelerate

826
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,360
the development

827
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,480
of the digital society and to make life

828
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,520
easier for people and businesses

829
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,720
therefore digital transformation digital

830
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,120
technologies and cyber security will

831
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,080
be the priorities of the eu presidency

832
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,279
when it comes to

833
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,320
fostering a european single market this

834
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,200
includes

835
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,919
improving connectivity developing secure

836
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,600
and efficient digital infrastructure

837
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,279
including 5g

838
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,799
safe and open web and cyberspace

839
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,080
resilience to cyber and hybrid threats

840
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
improving digital skills i already

841
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,200
mentioned

842
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
accessible digital public services and

843
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,120
creating a favorable

844
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,360
environment for the development testing

845
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,679
and use of new technologies

846
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,559
we will focus on several legislative

847
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,520
acts and

848
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,000
strive to reach as much progress as

849
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,039
possible

850
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,240
in the council regarding artificial

851
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,600
intelligence act

852
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,559
data governance act digital services and

853
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,600
markets package

854
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,000
was already mentioned by my colleagues

855
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,080
roaming regulation is also important

856
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,600
because it's something that

857
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,960
it's the most tangible thing for a

858
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
european citizens and of course the

859
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,159
directive on

860
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,120
measures for a higher common level of

861
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
cybersecurity across the union

862
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,080
uh the so-called nis ii directive

863
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,279
um for example regarding

864
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,960
ai it is crucial to create a high level

865
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,320
of trust

866
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,520
in ai and in order to do this ai should

867
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,919
be developed and used in a way that is

868
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,640
responsible focused on common interests

869
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,720
and on people

870
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,159
ai is means not an end and we all know

871
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,279
that it offers

872
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,399
immense potential in health transport

873
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,279
energy agriculture tourism or cyber

874
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,640
security

875
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,760
but what it's important uh the new rules

876
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,679
should be applied directly in the same

877
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,880
way across all

878
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,840
member states and this is how we create

879
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,880
unified and

880
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,159
trustworthy uh environment uh

881
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,480
not forget we should also focus on

882
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,840
digital skills

883
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,279
to fill the competence gap um

884
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,880
regarding data which is closely

885
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,480
connected to ai

886
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,799
we should by all means better exploit

887
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,399
the potential of data

888
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,240
and data should be used as a key

889
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,320
resource for startups

890
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,360
small and medium-sized enterprises and

891
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,960
for the development of their

892
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,519
products and services we should focus on

893
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,440
the flow of data within the eu

894
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,559
and across sectors in line with

895
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,159
clear fair rules for their access

896
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,399
storage and reuse

897
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,840
of course regarding the digital services

898
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,519
and markets package

899
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,399
our aim what we should do is to prevent

900
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,320
the exposure of citizens

901
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,120
to increasing risks and harmful

902
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,600
consequences online

903
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,200
and the control over large platforms

904
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,440
should be more efficient to prevent

905
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,240
abuse

906
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,279
of their systems so we should

907
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,679
enhance cooperation among public

908
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,200
authorities to ensure effective

909
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,240
enforcement

910
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,039
across the single market what we

911
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,960
shouldn't forget

912
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,080
is related to all the uh the files the

913
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,360
cyber security

914
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,760
and we will pay special attention to

915
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,120
strengthening the

916
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,640
cyber resilience of critical

917
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,399
infrastructure and the

918
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,960
digital single market in the event of a

919
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,000
possible

920
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,200
large-scale cyber attack so

921
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,679
you bring up this issue of a lot of

922
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,919
different new threats emerging threats

923
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,880
cyber threats that the european union is

924
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,399
going to have to confront we're seeing a

925
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,039
lot of

926
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,200
new types of attacks very prominent in

927
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,880
the united states for example around

928
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,760
ransomware

929
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,640
uh the pipeline attack on colonial uh

930
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,799
meat processing etc

931
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,039
i have a question for ambassador frohman

932
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,399
in this in this area

933
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,000
um it's kind of a lateral question on

934
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,519
cryptocurrencies which is

935
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,360
do you consider cryptocurrencies a

936
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,760
threat to national controlled

937
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,720
or uh regulated economies and let's take

938
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,840
it even a step further to national

939
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,519
security

940
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,320
well cryptocurrencies uh cover a lot of

941
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,799
different

942
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,799
ideas um uh there are stable coins there

943
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,120
are central bank digital currencies

944
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,320
uh being being explored i think

945
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,159
to take a step back i think the

946
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,440
blockchain

947
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,919
offers enormous opportunity uh for

948
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:30,799
innovation

949
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,279
uh across payments and across a lot of

950
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,559
other areas

951
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,200
as well and our perspective is is that

952
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,000
there may be a

953
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,519
role for digital currencies if

954
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,279
they provide first of all if they're

955
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,120
completely consistent with

956
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,640
the regulatory framework if they provide

957
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,279
consumer value and if there's a level

958
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,360
playing field so a variety of players

959
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,240
can play

960
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,120
uh in it in the competitive uh fashion

961
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,559
we're working with central banks all

962
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,480
over the world we created a sandbox for

963
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,279
them to

964
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,279
experiment with regulations with regard

965
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,640
to digital uh

966
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,799
currencies and i think it's too early to

967
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,879
tell exactly how this is going to

968
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,960
evolve um but there's certainly going to

969
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,560
be a lot of innovation

970
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,879
uh in this area can i just say something

971
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,560
on the previous comments uh

972
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,480
though if you don't mind i i think it

973
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,639
points out a really interesting

974
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,440
set of questions to explore clearly the

975
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,918
eu has been at the lead when it comes to

976
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,520
privacy regulation and gdpr is being now

977
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,760
applied elsewhere around the world by

978
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,639
companies and

979
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,480
adopted by other governments in some

980
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,520
form in some form or another

981
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,719
and there's absolutely legitimate

982
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,119
privacy concerns but finding

983
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,960
the right balance between protecting

984
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
individual privacy

985
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,159
and private information personal

986
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,719
information and the benefits

987
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,719
of cross-border data flows and i'll just

988
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,000
give you two examples

989
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,520
i think it's pretty clear to people that

990
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,520
we would not have had as much progress

991
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,200
as we've had in developing

992
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
vaccines for covet if you couldn't share

993
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,320
data across

994
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,560
borders and similarly all the discussion

995
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,359
we've just had about cyber security

996
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,680
because we see transactions all over the

997
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,400
world

998
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,800
and we see it we're a trust network we

999
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,760
can identify

1000
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,119
cyber attacks patterns that emerge in

1001
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,480
ukraine philippines uh nigeria

1002
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,560
and we've saved tens of billions of

1003
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,240
dollars for countries by

1004
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,920
making sure that we've identified with

1005
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,160
ai these cyber security threats and fix

1006
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,880
them if you have national clouds uh

1007
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,480
balkanized internet

1008
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,960
you run the risk of not being able to

1009
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,720
make those kinds of judgments

1010
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,320
and so we just have to make sure we're

1011
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,320
finding ways of addressing

1012
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,760
privacy other legitimate uh

1013
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,320
regulatory needs but not throwing the

1014
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,480
baby out with the bath water so to speak

1015
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,079
and losing the benefits of an open

1016
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,920
digital economy including around

1017
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,880
innovation

1018
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,680
and around cyber security at deputy

1019
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,760
prime minister

1020
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,760
ambassador frohman brings up a key point

1021
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,280
in the tension between the u.s and

1022
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,920
europe

1023
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,359
which is the question around data

1024
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,119
privacy and how it should be dealt with

1025
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,640
and respected

1026
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,079
how does slovakia see

1027
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,760
this this privacy debate how does

1028
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,160
slovakia see the implementation of gdpr

1029
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,599
is this something that stifles

1030
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,200
innovation or is this something that

1031
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,079
enhances

1032
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,520
uh slovakian and european

1033
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,200
competitiveness

1034
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,400
it's true that european union is the

1035
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,119
champion

1036
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,160
of regulation that's true

1037
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,119
and i think that we should boost also

1038
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,480
innovation because the

1039
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,240
the most

1040
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,800
innovative firms and enterprises are

1041
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,599
either

1042
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,960
today in the united states or china

1043
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,440
so i think that it is really very

1044
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,640
important to find

1045
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,160
a proper balance between regulation

1046
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,240
and innovation boost as far as gdpr is

1047
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,000
concerned in slovakia

1048
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,119
we saw that i don't want to say

1049
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,920
problems with gdpr but it was

1050
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,200
with some of the digital covet solutions

1051
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,320
gdpr

1052
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,370
was real real

1053
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,920
[Music]

1054
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,280
real problem because we wanted to find

1055
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,119
for example tracking of covet

1056
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,599
positive patients without breaking gdpr

1057
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,040
europe and gdpr rules but at the same

1058
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,320
time

1059
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,400
i think yes that the balance between

1060
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,599
consumer privacy and

1061
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,640
rights of consumer is very important

1062
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,160
just let me mention uh for um

1063
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,200
you spoke about critical independence

1064
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,920
in um or independence of critical

1065
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,800
infrastructure

1066
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,680
in the european union i want just to

1067
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,079
mention

1068
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,480
one initiative you saw a wonderful

1069
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,880
presentation i think of mr danilock

1070
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,079
about the tachyon uh microchip so in

1071
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,040
slovakia

1072
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,240
uh we just our ambition is to to build

1073
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,599
a new supercomputer and that will be one

1074
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,800
of the europe's

1075
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,760
fastest computer system and we have a

1076
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,000
close partnership between

1077
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,839
business academia and we want it

1078
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,920
we want to encourage a building system

1079
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,800
with theoretical computing power up to

1080
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,839
520 petaflops that could offer this

1081
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,560
uh capacity to research institutions

1082
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,119
small and medium-sized enterprises

1083
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,240
just to boost independence of

1084
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,800
uh critical infrastructure in slovakia

1085
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,760
so this is very

1086
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,800
important uh for slovakia and

1087
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,920
to build a ecosystem uh innovative

1088
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,040
ecosystem

1089
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,200
around the around the supercomputer

1090
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,119
minister kiritnik we have a question

1091
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,720
from the audience that uh

1092
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,680
it touches on some of this let's say the

1093
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:56,079
transatlantic atmospherics that we have

1094
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,920
been talking about and it's

1095
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,000
is it possible for tech companies to

1096
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,440
grow in central and eastern europe

1097
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,520
without getting acquired by large

1098
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,079
mostly u.s companies is there room to

1099
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:06,800
grow

1100
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,560
and maybe we can add uh chinese

1101
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,320
companies because clearly there is a

1102
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,160
higher presence now with

1103
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,520
with ali cloud alipay uh tiktok

1104
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,800
all coming into the european uh market

1105
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,680
space

1106
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,800
um what is the room for european

1107
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,560
companies to grow without being acquired

1108
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:24,960
by

1109
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,079
by external actors

1110
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,079
oh thank you for the question which is

1111
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,160
sorry so

1112
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,040
please oh you mentioned i'm about to

1113
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,200
answer it okay

1114
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,520
well uh indeed it's not the field i

1115
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
cover within the ministry

1116
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,280
but regarding my previous experience i

1117
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
would always say it's a

1118
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,599
choice for the owner uh for the for the

1119
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,320
founder

1120
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,760
to decide to be acquired or not it's

1121
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,960
his free will and his uh let's say

1122
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,720
estimation of how his company his child

1123
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,760
could his startup would grow better

1124
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,680
um keeping it for for himself or

1125
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,119
selling or allowing a foreign investor

1126
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:11,839
to come in

1127
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:15,680
regardless of what flag

1128
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,839
the investor carries so that's why let's

1129
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,280
say previous experience

1130
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,359
answer but of course i would als always

1131
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,880
as a a politician in an eu member state

1132
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,319
say that uh of course they can grow

1133
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,960
but we are we will try to make the

1134
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,720
environment better so they can grow

1135
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,200
better

1136
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,319
that's a political answer that is

1137
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,200
obviously a very

1138
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,599
laissez-faire answer very open answer uh

1139
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,560
open market

1140
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,720
answer but we're in a moment right now

1141
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,079
where there's a lot more scrutiny of

1142
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,520
investment right we're in a moment where

1143
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,280
there's a lot more consideration

1144
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,960
around mergers and acquisitions and what

1145
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,640
that could mean for the strength of

1146
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,160
indigenous economies

1147
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,560
uh minister ramisova you you i know you

1148
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,480
had a response to this

1149
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,839
is this something that europe needs to

1150
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,079
take more seriously external actors

1151
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,440
looking to acquire

1152
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,680
let's say the crown jewels of european

1153
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
innovation

1154
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,920
of course the ambition of europe and of

1155
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,119
european union

1156
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:14,319
and the member states should be to keep

1157
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:16,000
the intellectual property

1158
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,440
here in slovakia that's when i s

1159
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,240
when i said that uh we want to as a

1160
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,720
state

1161
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,680
slovakia we want to build a partnership

1162
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,839
uh with the academia with the business

1163
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:28,480
uh

1164
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,680
uh for not only for super computing but

1165
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,720
also for other

1166
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,640
initiatives like blockchain initiative

1167
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,839
or digital innovation hubs

1168
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,359
which are exactly the partnership

1169
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,960
between

1170
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,400
tech firms and between state

1171
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,960
and the second thing which was already

1172
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,599
mentioned is

1173
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,880
regulation i think that we should

1174
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,160
make a regulatory framework

1175
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,680
innovation friendly and this is the role

1176
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
for the european union but only for

1177
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,760
individual member states

1178
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,240
to make a regulatory framework

1179
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,200
innovation friendly

1180
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,839
ambassador froman when you look at this

1181
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,200
regulation that is coming down the

1182
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,480
pipeline i can say

1183
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,640
we did an event at the german council

1184
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,560
for relations last week with the

1185
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,839
chair of the national security

1186
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,400
commission on artificial intelligence

1187
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,720
eric schmidt and he was asked what he

1188
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,960
thought about the ai regulation and he

1189
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,680
called it a disaster

1190
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,800
what do you think when you look at this

1191
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,359
new

1192
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,280
raft of regulation coming down the pike

1193
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,119
and what you think will be its impact on

1194
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,000
innovation

1195
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
do you think it is innovation friendly

1196
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,160
as the deputy prime minister would like

1197
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,119
it to be

1198
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,880
well it's a great question and i haven't

1199
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,319
delved into the details of all the

1200
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,000
regulations but i think the deputy prime

1201
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,400
minister really put it right which is

1202
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,599
uh the eu excels at

1203
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,640
issuing uh regulations and i think

1204
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,040
what's

1205
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
really important is that there be enough

1206
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,720
transparency

1207
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,240
and input from a wide range of

1208
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,480
stakeholders whether it's

1209
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,359
civil society private sector other

1210
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,560
governments

1211
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,599
as as they form these regulations just

1212
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,880
so they get the benefit

1213
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,680
of all the input to understand more

1214
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,720
fully

1215
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,720
what impact it could have on innovation

1216
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,920
as the deputy prime minister

1217
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,839
laid out much of the innovation in this

1218
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,280
sector is happening

1219
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,960
outside of the european union you have

1220
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,640
to ask yourself why

1221
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,880
and this is an opportunity to ensure

1222
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,480
that even as

1223
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,400
very legitimate issues get addressed

1224
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,760
through regulation

1225
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,000
it's not further delaying or further

1226
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,280
impeding

1227
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,280
an innovative ecosystem in europe

1228
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,720
because europe has a tremendous amount

1229
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,839
that it can contribute

1230
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,560
to this area it but it does need the

1231
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,000
enabling environment to do so

1232
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,079
minister one of the things that people

1233
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,839
always mention when they talk about

1234
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,319
innovation in europe is europe has a lot

1235
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,079
of amazing innovation but it's not being

1236
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,359
commercialized

1237
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,119
that the commercialization is happening

1238
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,560
outside of europe great things are

1239
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,480
happening from the mp3 player to the

1240
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,440
computer

1241
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
but the the companies that are turning

1242
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,800
this into profitable

1243
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,240
uh enterprises are elsewhere how

1244
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,960
can europe bridge that gap how can it

1245
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,400
bridge that commercialization gap

1246
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,400
yes well now i i'm in a bit of

1247
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,560
difficulty in which way i'm siding

1248
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,599
because um if i look on a stone an

1249
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,240
example

1250
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,520
and we are part of all the eu regulation

1251
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,560
and we've been able to to grow here

1252
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,200
seven unicorns uh there is a lot of

1253
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,359
innovation what is happening

1254
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,920
uh i think uh maybe we are sometimes too

1255
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:42,560
humble

1256
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,599
uh in uh in talking about uh

1257
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,240
where we have excelled and where we have

1258
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,280
been

1259
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,800
very competitive uh in and in that sense

1260
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,000
uh i think we um

1261
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,720
where we can we can and shoot tomorrow

1262
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,839
is precisely

1263
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,240
to creating one single market and i very

1264
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,079
much agree with the points on the data

1265
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,040
flows

1266
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,800
cross-border because that is really what

1267
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,760
we need for innovation

1268
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,880
but otherwise i i think

1269
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,920
i don't see it in in

1270
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,560
in red talk colors i would i would

1271
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,119
rather put it differently i mean it's uh

1272
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,359
it it's we have lots of opportunities if

1273
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:24,560
we can

1274
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,480
if we can make a single market uh in

1275
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,800
digital domain truly working

1276
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,599
and then there is i mean we we we all

1277
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,400
know that

1278
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,520
there is also significant repositioning

1279
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,160
globally

1280
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,720
in terms of uh strategic industries

1281
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,440
uh strategic value chains and supply

1282
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,640
chains

1283
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,079
and we need to be attractive for uh

1284
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,359
as an investment destination yes

1285
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,720
there are many regulations but

1286
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,560
regulations are increasing uh

1287
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,200
also i think in other places and that's

1288
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,240
not really

1289
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,920
kind of common european or only european

1290
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,720
topic and also when i mentioned there

1291
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,440
was a topic about or a question about

1292
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,079
investment screening i mean in my

1293
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,440
previous

1294
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,640
positions i had to deal a lot with

1295
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,520
with financial industry and in financial

1296
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,880
industry there has always been a

1297
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,400
screening

1298
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,640
about the management about the owners of

1299
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,760
the banks or other financial

1300
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,280
institutions so that they are beaten

1301
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,400
proper

1302
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,839
i think what has happened with the

1303
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:30,240
digitalization uh that there have been

1304
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:30,720
number

1305
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,400
other critical infrastructures and

1306
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,160
critical industries which

1307
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,640
need comparable screening it's not that

1308
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,680
we prevent

1309
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,720
innovation to uh to develop or prevent

1310
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,800
companies away but it's more to make

1311
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,960
sure that this system is

1312
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,560
reliable it is transparent and it is

1313
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,720
it is safe and i wouldn't really be

1314
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,040
concerned if somebody wants to invest in

1315
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,359
the companies who have been invented in

1316
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,960
europe i think that actually is a

1317
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,119
positive

1318
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,119
positive dimension so

1319
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:06,880
i think we should be more upbeat glass

1320
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,200
is never half empty for europe it's

1321
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,079
always half full

1322
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,119
at least glass is always half full i'm

1323
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,000
going to ask one

1324
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,319
final question to everybody on the panel

1325
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,599
one sentence

1326
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,200
we're half foot we've got a glass half

1327
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,280
full we want to get it awful

1328
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,480
completely full we're looking at the

1329
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,000
digital compass this has a lot of

1330
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,480
objectives looking towards 2030.

1331
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,440
um if you could name one thing where you

1332
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,359
would like europe to exceed

1333
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,119
its objectives where europe should be a

1334
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,119
leader where europe is

1335
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,040
creating a framework for innovation

1336
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,240
where europe is

1337
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,920
inspiring other countries the united

1338
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,280
states china et cetera

1339
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,520
in the field of technology what would

1340
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,480
you like to be

1341
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,160
kind of the headline in the digital

1342
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,079
compass in 2030

1343
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,359
looking back so in 2030

1344
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,480
in one sentence uh looking back

1345
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,280
you know europe is is the hub for

1346
00:47:59,280 --> 00:47:59,920
fintech

1347
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,400
or europe is the hub for uh i.t

1348
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,359
professionals

1349
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,760
what would that one thing be one

1350
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,640
sentence

1351
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,000
deputy prime minister you're first

1352
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,879
up for

1353
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,960
well i'm always coming up from national

1354
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,760
context so i would say super computing

1355
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,359
yes and at the same time i think

1356
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,119
we set path or standards for

1357
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,280
ethic for example for artificial

1358
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,599
intelligence which is very important

1359
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,000
uh it's not the same as a regulatory

1360
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,800
framework

1361
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,319
but setting up regulat ethical standards

1362
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,079
for for all the digital innovation

1363
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,800
in the world so i think this two parts

1364
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,000
are very important

1365
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,599
perfect uh ambassador sut minister said

1366
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,960
excuse me yes

1367
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,280
i think it is about data

1368
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,880
it's about protecting their

1369
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,319
the values when processing and

1370
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,400
using data for innovation because this

1371
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,760
is where the value is going to be

1372
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,720
created

1373
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,800
i think that would be the most single

1374
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,240
important

1375
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,200
factor determining uh how competitive we

1376
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,480
are

1377
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,960
minister karitnik what is your sentence

1378
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,680
well uh determining harnessing the many

1379
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,200
opportunities

1380
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,160
addressing challenges in a future proof

1381
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,480
sustainable manner

1382
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,680
perfect ambassador frohman looking

1383
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,200
across the ocean what do you want to see

1384
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,040
in 10 years

1385
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,760
i'd love to see europe as the hub of

1386
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,640
innovation

1387
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,760
at the nexus of digital transformation

1388
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,880
and the green economy that sounds

1389
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,839
perfect for us

1390
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,119

1391
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,280
that uh jeff bulwinkel

1392
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,920
what do you think echoing what others

1393
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,079
have said i'd also say that europe can

1394
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,000
be and should be a center of innovation

1395
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,359
built upon leveraging

1396
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,440
data effectively in the context of the

1397
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,680
world of artificial intelligence where

1398
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,240
regulation need not be antithetical to

1399
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,599
innovation

1400
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,760
perfect all right i i see a europe in

1401
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,680

1402
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,319
a moral leader a super computing leader

1403
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,000
and a green tech leader

1404
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,839
