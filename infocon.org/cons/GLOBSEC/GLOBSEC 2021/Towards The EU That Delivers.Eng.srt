38
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,560
unfortunately

42
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,240
question to you

is um as an eu citizen today

44
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,199

you

46
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,320
in your daily life don't be afraid when

47
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
you answer of being trivial if your

48
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,199
answer is

49
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,320
it's free roaming well be it but i'm

50
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,520
just asking you to give

51
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,840
short answers and preferably two three

52
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
keywords so that we can sort out your

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
answer

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
um we'll start with uh mr bone

55
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,320
your visit here is very very very timely

56
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,160
because france still will have to

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,720
deliver

58
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,960
france is taking over the rotating

59
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
presidency of the eu

60
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,199
in january but frankly most people in

61
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,919
europe

62
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,400
and uh most people in france don't know

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,320
or don't even care who holds the eu

64
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,520
presidency right

65
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,440
so how can you change that that's my

66
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
question how can you make sure that

67
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
people know who is

68
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,880
presiding over the eu and care and i'm

69
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,479
not just talking about diplomatic

70
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
circles i'm talking about your

71
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
regular european citizen mr bone

72
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
thank you very much and i'm very happy

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,720
to be back to globsec and

74
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
in bratislava today this is a big

75
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
challenge to make sure we prepare our

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
presidency well and we try to have

77
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,240
deliverables but of course usually it's

78
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,960
not enough

79
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,600
to make people just realize that there

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
is something happening about europe

81
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
in their country in france in this case

82
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,919
so we are trying i'm trying to

83
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,960
develop a kind of environment i would

84
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,600
say

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,080
of cultural projects sports projects

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,639
which

87
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,680
make people realize that there is a

88
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,919
something european happening or that

89
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,280
they are part of it

90
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,600
uh we are trying to identify for

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,319
instance all

92
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
events before the presidency even before

93
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,440
the presidency

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,160
uh like we have a culture days in

95
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,440
september in which all

96
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,199
monuments are public we want to make

97
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,840
them europeanized in a way so that

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,560
people

99
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,479
know when they go to the elysee palace

100
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,560
or to the versailles castle that there

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,400
was something about europe bad or

102
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,280
positive

103
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,199
which happened in the past here and that

104
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,800
they have a european background

105
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
i think the most difficult thing is to

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,479
make people understand that europe is

107
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,440
not about

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
directives regulations summits

109
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
of course we need that we are working on

110
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,039
it and it's necessary to deliver

111
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,240
reforms but there is a european culture

112
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,520
there is a european uh sports

113
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,479
community we are going through the euro

114
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,639
championship at the moment syria is a

115
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,440
eurovision there is uh people think it's

116
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,319
anecdotes

117
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,280
i do think it's very important to use

118
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,919
this

119
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,120
backbone of popular cultural sports

120
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,479
events to make sure that people

121
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,400
understand they're part of something

122
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,440
so we will try to make as many events

123
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,759
as we can not just for the sake of

124
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,440
organizing nice things

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
and postcode we need them more than ever

126
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,599
but also to develop this sense

127
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,319
of belonging if i just can conclude on

128
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,960
this we

129
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,520
we have defined so far three key words

130
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,960
for the presidency

131
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
uh which are uh roland's pisos

132
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,240
apartments in french so recovery

133
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,560
we will need this recovery still to be

134
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,520
implemented

135
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,840
and our recovery plan in particular

136
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,599
power because we have a big

137
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,520
sovereignty agenda we may revert to that

138
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,599
as you know but also belonging a

139
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,720
partners because

140
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
i think that developing through mobility

141
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,240
through cultures through education and

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,000
concrete initiatives

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
france in europe but europe in france

144
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
even more important

145
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,400
we need to insist on this to make

146
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,680
these six months very useful

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
and as as

148
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,360
fruitful as possible also for the french

149
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,240
public

150
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,120
to make this awareness higher so it's

151
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,039
mostly about communications then

152
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
no no i don't i mean for communication i

153
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
don't think it's a dirty word it's

154
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,039
important to explain what is happening

155
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
and to make this six months a moment of

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
yes of communication of public

157
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,199
communication events gatherings but it's

158
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,958
also explaining what have what we have

159
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,880
achieved over the four years because

160
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
as you know president macron and the

161
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,479
french government have insisted

162
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,240
probably more than any french government

163
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
before on

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,760
the importance of belonging to europe

165
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
the ability we have to push

166
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,839
what we think are important reforms in

167
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,519
europe to develop

168
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,440
bilateral relations on the network in

169
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
europe this is also why i'm

170
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,200
coming for the first time to slovakia

171
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,959
for instance and i will come back

172
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,240
dear martin um but uh it's uh

173
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,600
it's also about this european reflex

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,240
i can say this european feeling this

175
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
european sense of belonging that we need

176
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,920
so much of course we all know about

177
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,120
erasmus but it's five percent of

178
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,519
students of one generation i want this

179
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,720
type of

180
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,000
i would like that each young european

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,040
or less young european have the memory

182
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,279
of one european experience whether it's

183
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,560
just a striking movie a trip

184
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,600
a university exchange an internship

185
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
somewhere

186
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
a discussion in another language with a

187
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,560
european colleague whatever

188
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
but if you have this european experience

189
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
you are a european

190
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,959
foreign right um can we can i

191
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,880
kindly ask our backstage office to

192
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,560
display maybe the first answers of the

193
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:46,959
poll

194
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,680
so that we see what the eu has brought

195
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,000
to

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,640
uh the citizens were voting or using the

197
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,720
app right now so i see freedom of travel

198
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,760
free movement

199
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,360
a big one the euro um interesting we

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,240
were just discussing

201
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,839
the fact that some people don't find the

202
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,320
euro

203
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
being an advantage human rights safety

204
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
standards trade consumer protection

205
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,600
traveling uh peace and security

206
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
peace etc interesting so um

207
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,839
all these advantages are clear and and

208
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,640
clearly benefit eu citizens and yet

209
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,880
anti-eu parties are on the rise in

210
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,399
europe they're knocking at the door in

211
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,240
many countries slovakia

212
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
might somehow be an exception with

213
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
rising support for eu membership i think

214
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,240
a recent poll showed that 80

215
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,279
of people in slovakia are in favor of eu

216
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,279
membership which is very high

217
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,279
and yet the government uh grabbed the

218
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,200
headlines earlier this year for ordering

219
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
sputnik vaccines from from russia

220
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,000
which is a key success of russia's

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,440
vaccine diplomacy

222
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,959
um i just at the time when uh the eu was

223
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,720
having a slow start with vaccine

224
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,600
deliveries

225
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,320
so mr kluse my question is for you all

226
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,880
in all

227
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,880
how do you see uh the strategy the covet

228
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,600
crisis

229
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,320
uh an eu strategy to tackle this crisis

230
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
affecting the opinion

231
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,440
your citizens have uh on on the european

232
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
union

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
thank you and uh good morning to

234
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,399
everybody i'm very happy to have you in

235
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,839
bratislava uh

236
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,519
as far as i can see we are looking like

237
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
a twins with clemont today

238
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,200
that's fantastic and uh well

239
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
uh first of all uh strategy

240
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,440
communication i believe it's very

241
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
important for all of us

242
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,240
if it comes to the european union that's

243
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,760
why i really appreciate what clemont

244
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,440
said about his uh

245
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,720
idea of a french presidency we need to

246
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,560
speak up to our citizens that's why we

247
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,240
start also the conference of the future

248
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,279
of europe

249
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,440
and i believe it's very important too

250
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
for us

251
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,880
politicians but not only also for

252
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
business also for

253
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,880
academic environment for everybody to

254
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,680
speak about

255
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,360
what the european union concretely

256
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,279
delivered to our citizens because we are

257
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,000
forgetting that

258
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,760
very often you mentioned vaccine

259
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,279
diplomacy but

260
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,639
uh let's not forget uh march 2020 when

261
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,639
we spoke about the mess diplomacy it was

262
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,160
about the chinese in the time

263
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,600
now it's about the russians if it comes

264
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,440
to the vaccine diplomacy

265
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
unfortunately this country is heavily

266
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
affected by

267
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,399
propaganda hoaxes and

268
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,160
that's why i really appreciate also the

269
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,760
effort of the european commission and

270
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,959
european parliament

271
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,959
to discuss what should be the social

272
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,000
responsibility

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
of the social networks for instance

274
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,000
because it's heavily interconnected

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,839
especially in uh small countries like

276
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,519
slovakia uh

277
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,560
so if we want to keep the track of a

278
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,000
positive mood if it comes to the

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,399
european union we need to work hard on

280
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,360
that and

281
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,800
we need to bring very concrete

282
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,880
deliveries for our citizens

283
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
and when i saw the poll we can clearly

284
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,079
see that uh

285
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,839
people appreciating especially free

286
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,680
movement and

287
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,800
what we can't repeat never ever

288
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,440
is to have a situation like during the

289
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,040
first wave of pandemia

290
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,920
that we lock down our countries so even

291
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,200
if it comes to the movement of the

292
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,079
people

293
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,760
we slow down at least slow down

294
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,240
locked one of the main freedoms of the

295
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,760
european union which is freedom of

296
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,639
movement

297
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,200
and i get thousands of emails from our

298
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
citizens who are all around the european

299
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,680
union

300
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,519
this is the european union you promised

301
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,279
us so

302
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,440
please don't repeat it uh anymore and

303
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,360
try to find uh

304
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
all together uh the way

305
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,360
uh out from uh from pandemia a different

306
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,839
way

307
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,600
than the locking of the borders because

308
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,760
uh that will be very critical

309
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,760
also in 2022 during the french

310
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,839
presidential election

311
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,839
german presidential uh german uh

312
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,160
parliamentary election in autumn time

313
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
uh i believe people understand what's

314
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
going on in this case and uh

315
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,079
we need to find european solutions for

316
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,600
that so you think

317
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,079
after these lockdowns after a slow start

318
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,360
with the vaccines it's going a bit

319
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,040
better but a slow start nevertheless

320
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,560
especially compared to the uk do you

321
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,880
think

322
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,240
people will come out of this crisis more

323
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,680
uh involved a more pro-eu or less

324
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,360
keen to be eu members that's up to us so

325
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,000
i believe if we are using strategy

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
communication we are trying our best in

327
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,839
slovakia not only

328
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,320
i can say many positive words for

329
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,920
instance about the portuguese presidency

330
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,959
nowadays

331
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,880
uh then people understand how important

332
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,279
are these so-called european solutions

333
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,399
also if it council to strategic autonomy

334
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:26,959
for instance

335
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,279
which which we will speak about later

336
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,560
also if it comes to

337
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,600
uh join uh procurement of vaccines for

338
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
instance which was very very important

339
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,480
for this country

340
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,440
uh except of this uh short story uh with

341
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,480
uh

342
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,639
sputnik vaccine and i believe uh

343
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,440
uh what is most important now is to uh

344
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
introduce

345
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,800
european uh kovit certificates uh with

346
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,320
no delay anymore

347
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
and which will be technically prepared

348
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,000
well because that will allow our

349
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,440
citizens to travel more

350
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
and i'm sure that uh most of us need to

351
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,839
go for a vacation to some of the

352
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,519
european countries

353
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,560
indeed mrs hallmeyer

354
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,399
welcome one important uh point

355
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,800
for eu citizens i think is that the

356
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,680
european union

357
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,639
did manage to find an agreement to spend

358
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,279
billions

359
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,480
on recovery from the covet crisis now

360
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,399
the challenge is basically to make sure

361
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,160
that these funds are channeled to

362
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,040
regular citizens and any citizens what's

363
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,759
the biggest

364
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,440
obstacle in your opinion for these eu

365
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,279
funds to be disbursed and to be

366
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,839
efficient

367
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,279
um so firstly perhaps and so firstly

368
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,079
reactions

369
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,440
short reactions on my uh my two

370
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
speakers said two co-speakers

371
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,120
or received the member states of that

372
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,160
member states

373
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,639
then eu effective if manchester united

374
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,160
are not doing it if represented i'm not

375
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,759
doing so receiving the

376
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,320
recovery phone we see it very clearly we

377
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,000
see it very clearly that

378
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,480
uh we can be successful we can decide

379
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,600
well it seems that we have some

380
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,519
technical issues that's fine

381
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,320
um mr bone the question back to you then

382
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
what do you think would be the biggest

383
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
obstacle to a smooth disbursement of

384
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,079
these eu funds

385
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,160
well the idleness is a big obstacle we

386
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,199
had some

387
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,399
obstacles to get where we are which is

388
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,320
now the moment when you can disburse the

389
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,399
fence and

390
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,000
you can it uh in two ways you can say

391
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,920
in comparison with what we were able to

392
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,759
do sometimes at the national level

393
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,360
when the emergency measures had

394
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,440
everywhere in the eu to be put in place

395
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
that it was long and slow because

396
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,720
we had a political agreement in european

397
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,600
council

398
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,680
last summer in july and it's just

399
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,199
starting now

400
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:56,959
as i tend to say it was not a

401
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,720
bureaucratic time it was a democratic

402
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,440
time that we used and it's true because

403
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
we needed an agreement between the

404
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,439
council and our european parliament that

405
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,959
all europeans elect

406
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,760
and then they needed a ratification by

407
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,880
all national parliaments

408
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,559
i mean if we want to do differently we

409
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,480
have to say it but

410
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,039
can we say at the same time that europe

411
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,880
is too slow and that we want democratic

412
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,679
checks

413
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,919
at the national level if we need that

414
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,280
and i think we need that

415
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,959
it takes a bit of time that's the way it

416
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,439
is overall it was quite quick

417
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,240
and it's starting now after a few months

418
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
of this process and if we want to make

419
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,320
it a success

420
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,559
to be frank i think a country like

421
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,840
france

422
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,640
has a big responsibility because as you

423
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,120
know we

424
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,880
we pushed so very strongly for it at the

425
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,160
moment when

426
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
it was so difficult we worked together

427
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
on it

428
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,880
but it was extremely difficult to even

429
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,080
mention the idea in march 2020 april

430
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,880
2020

431
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,320
a month afterwards there was a french

432
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
german agreement two months after that

433
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,760
there was a unanimous agreement in

434
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,880
european council

435
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
now if we want to make sure that this is

436
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,200
a big opportunity

437
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,440
and not just a nice surprise

438
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,559
that came up out of a long night in

439
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,440
brussels

440
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,039
we have to make sure that it goes to the

441
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,559
right sectors

442
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,960
green transition digital transformation

443
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,559
that is spend quickly

444
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,280
that it spends wisely on key investments

445
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
and not a

446
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,440
less useful project and so on so i think

447
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,720
this

448
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,440
idea that we are discussing our national

449
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,240
plans

450
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,440
at the european level which was

451
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,080
sometimes criticized in france

452
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
because it's you know european checking

453
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,440
what is the what is being done with the

454
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,559
money of course

455
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,799
we are borrowing together it's normal

456
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
that we have

457
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,320
everyone a say on what the others are

458
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,280
doing

459
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,760
and france is the same it goes both ways

460
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,080
it's perfectly rational perfectly normal

461
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,360
and perfectly sounds

462
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,960
but now it's good that through this

463
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,520
discussion we have a coordination of the

464
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,320
big

465
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,400
issues and i think what maybe we should

466
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,679
do better

467
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,600
in the coming months is to have common

468
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,720
projects

469
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,200
when we want to invest in hydrogen we

470
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,840
want to

471
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,160
to invest in more medical research

472
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,080
innovation when we want to invest in in

473
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,120
batteries

474
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,240
all we need for the decade to come for

475
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,600
europe to be

476
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,559
at the technological frontier we need to

477
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,840
coordinate and to have common projects

478
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,520
we are starting this with germany but i

479
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,400
think maybe if we

480
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,640
want to make this plan successful we

481
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
need more of these common projects at

482
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,840
the european level between

483
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,679
eu countries you said in overall it uh

484
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,160
it we were quite quick in in sorting

485
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
this out and

486
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,120
finding an agreement mr kluse do you

487
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
agree um because these projects you know

488
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,640
the hydrogen project is

489
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,160
starting to uh starting to get in shape

490
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
but for example project on health are

491
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,679
taking a bit of time

492
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,600
at eu level especially if you compare it

493
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
to what the u.s can achieve

494
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,200
do you think it's fast enough well

495
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,440
of course could be faster but uh let's

496
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,360
take a look on

497
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,080
aki community which is not allowing us

498
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,559
to

499
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,400
to move some of the competencies from

500
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
the national states without changing of

501
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,919
the treaties and uh

502
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,080
uh that was one of the very clear

503
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,000
answers when people start to blame on

504
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,880
european union

505
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,320
uh in uh uh spring 2020 that uh

506
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,720
why they didn't act quickly enough the

507
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,039
same like russians or chinese

508
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,159
uh and uh the answer was uh very clear

509
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,919
that uh well they can't

510
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,760
because it's our responsibility it's a

511
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,919
responsibility of national state so

512
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,840
let's discuss also this option during

513
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,919
the conference of the future of europe

514
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,919
i believe we need to speak frankly to

515
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,000
our citizens that in some occasions like

516
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,080
pandemia for instance

517
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,280
maybe more europe is a good idea then we

518
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,480
need to speak about

519
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,039
some other competencies where maybe a

520
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,200
little more subsidiarity will be better

521
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,080
idea

522
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,760
so this is the conference of the future

523
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
of europe about and i believe we will

524
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,600
get very clear answers from our citizens

525
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,640
because they expect

526
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,280
as i said very concrete delivery from us

527
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,840
and

528
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,640
we are failing sometimes so i'm

529
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,400
optimistic of course so

530
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,520
and i believe uh 2021

531
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,919
uh was much more successful than the

532
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,960
2020

533
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,200
and if it comes to uh this recovery fund

534
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,840
i believe very concrete deliveries will

535
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
come in next two years

536
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,600
and this is very good news for all of us

537
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,280
because it's not only how to recover

538
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,480
from the pandemia

539
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,039
it's also how to make uh our national

540
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,000
states and european

541
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
union more digital more green better

542
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,679
educated

543
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,919
and uh i i believe this will bring uh

544
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,320
europe to the future generations in very

545
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,640
different shape that we get used to

546
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,960
indeed i just for those who are uh

547
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,039
eagerly waiting for mrs whole meyer to

548
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,600
appear

549
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,280
again we're just sorting out technical

550
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,640
issues just be back

551
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,720
probably shortly hopefully mr bony

552
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,760
wanted to react

553
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,840
i i just wanted to to to add something

554
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,520
because you said

555
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,320
are we going fast enough or going uh are

556
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,679
we going far enough

557
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,919
i just want to insist on that i think

558
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,280
when you look at the figures they will

559
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,760
not want to be too too detailed here but

560
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,600
in terms of emergency measures what we

561
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,679
did usually at the national level but if

562
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,280
we add up the numbers

563
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,720
of what was done in germany in france

564
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
and slovakia everywhere in the eu

565
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,280
we are exactly or even higher than the

566
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
level of spending

567
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,799
in terms of social protection protection

568
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,400
to our companies small businesses

569
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
jobs that the u.s has been doing

570
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,960
if you look at the recovery now i think

571
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,640
the figures are quite close

572
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,000
what i think is potentially

573
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,720
a gap is as a long-term investment plan

574
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,280
the us

575
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,960
is now developing we'll see what happens

576
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,559
in congress because president biden has

577
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,760
announced big numbers

578
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
maybe smaller in the end but on this i

579
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,520
think europe should do more but on the

580
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,120
rest i think we should not be shy or we

581
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,480
shouldn't be proud

582
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,960
of what we've been achieving it could be

583
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,840
faster

584
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
we all want it to be faster and to

585
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
improve our processes

586
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,320
but it's big it's very big and what we

587
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,600
have done at the national level

588
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,840
protecting our jobs our small

589
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
restaurants cafes all these small

590
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,400
businesses

591
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,840
and now with a recovery plan for the

592
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
next two to three years is big and

593
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,960
we should be aware and proud of it

594
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,480
yesterday there was the first

595
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,919
market emission of the eu regarding the

596
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,679
financing of this recovery plan

597
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,440
when you just look at the interest rates

598
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,799
it's interesting because it's

599
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,960
it's highly political in a way the

600
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,840
investors the markets

601
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,240
pro asked for seven times more what we

602
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,919
should and the interest rate

603
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,760
is just a bit higher than the german

604
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,760
rates a bit lower than the french

605
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,919
sovereign rate it means that there is

606
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,880
trust

607
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,480
in the eu financing it means that there

608
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
is trust in the future because you have

609
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,240
people and they are not ngos there are

610
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,679
market investors

611
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,360
who are defending their own financial

612
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,440
interests and they invest in the eu

613
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,000
for the next 40 years because we will

614
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,880
repay this plan

615
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,200
over 40 years so i think it's a sign of

616
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,720
trust in our future which is

617
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,799
extremely important after brexit after

618
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,720
the crisis we went through we should be

619
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,919
aware and proud of it

620
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,679
clearly the these investors believe the

621
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,120
eu will still be there and will still

622
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,640
stand at 40 years

623
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,400
um do you think mr bone as

624
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,640
mr macron actually mentioned it that you

625
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,080
must

626
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,720
start working on another short term

627
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,919
mightier

628
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,799
investment plan well it's the point i

629
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:19,679
was making

630
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,039
i think we should

631
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,720
we should not consider that our recovery

632
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,080
plan this uh

633
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,640
750 billion is small it is big now we

634
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,320
have to deliver to implement to make it

635
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,600
successful and so on

636
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,440
so to be direct and frank i don't

637
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
believe we could or we should have

638
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,559
another

639
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,080
four day summit in brussels in the

640
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,919
coming weeks to

641
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,919
change the numbers i think it would not

642
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,480
work to be realistic and pragmatic

643
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,080
especially since we have not spent the

644
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,520
money yet

645
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,799
what i do think is that what we could

646
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,360
lack

647
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,080
what when where the u.s could be faster

648
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,360
and more ambitious than us

649
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,799
is a 10-year investment plan

650
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,840
i'm not impressed about the numbers

651
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,679
2 000 um

652
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,840
to the 2 000 billion dollars that

653
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,360
president biden has announced for

654
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,360
immediate recovery or immediate support

655
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,080
what is impressive is this 10-year

656
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,520
investment plan in the u.s for

657
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,120
infrastructure and so on this we don't

658
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,799
have yet at the eu level

659
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,080
so it's not about our recovery our

660
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,840
recovery is for the next two years it's

661
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,679
quite short-term

662
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,440
it is what we do in 2030 in 2035

663
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,240
how do we invest now in microprocessors

664
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,200
microchips

665
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
in semiconductors in space industry

666
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,440
in uh batteries we have made progress in

667
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,120
the last two years

668
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,440
two to three years with a common project

669
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
at the level with

670
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
common eu funding but we don't have a

671
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
10-year investment plan at the

672
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,279
level and it's not only with eu money or

673
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,960
it's not necessary to command that it

674
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,840
could be i think

675
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,120
it could be but if this works

676
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,720
if this recovery plan works if it's

677
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
common networks if this investment

678
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
is producing concrete projects and

679
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,760
concrete results it will be easier

680
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,320
and necessary to open a discussion

681
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,120
probably

682
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
next year maybe starting during the

683
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,679
french presidency i would like it

684
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,400
on a 10-year investment plan at the eu

685
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,880
level this is not a second recovery plan

686
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,440
it is

687
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,600
i think a longer-term perspective with a

688
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,640
big investment plan

689
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,520
if we don't want to be lagging behind

690
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,480
the americans

691
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,840
chinese and others that is if the

692
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,720
so-called frugal countries agree to it

693
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,440
um glovesec has a perfect timing in the

694
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,240
sense that it's

695
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,159
coming right after g7 and right after

696
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,600
nato submits

697
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
both events show that eu allies are

698
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,120
still uncomfortable when it comes to

699
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,279
adopting a common position on china and

700
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,720
how to deal with china

701
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,559
and that makes sense i mean see germany

702
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,840
and its uh

703
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,200
car exports to china are you hopeful mr

704
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,000
bone that maybe

705
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,320
after the september elections in germany

706
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,400
um perhaps during the french presidency

707
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,279
of the eu even

708
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,159
you can be the uk it can be more united

709
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,240
on on china

710
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,520
well again i think we should it's not

711
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
perfect of course but we should

712
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,600
look at what has been happening the last

713
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,799
four five years

714
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,440
uh i remember when i was already working

715
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,360
in a different position for

716
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,200
minister macron at that time a french

717
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,120
economy minister we had discussions

718
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,600
about

719
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,120
recognizing the market economy status of

720
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,399
china in wto

721
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,559
that was five years ago only and there

722
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,840
was a debate

723
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,919
in the eu to recognize it that would

724
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,600
have mean that would have meant

725
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,880
dismantling our anti-dumping tools

726
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,200
and so on and so forth to open widely

727
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,919
our

728
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,559
protections in all respects to chinese

729
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,000
investment and chinese

730
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,039
dumping to be clear

731
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,279
the debate and the dna of eu and this

732
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,720
has totally changed

733
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,559
not only we have not recognized market

734
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,480
economy status we have transcend our

735
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,520
anti-dumping

736
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
instruments we have developed a

737
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
screening mechanism which i think is too

738
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,799
soft but it's the first step

739
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,799
to make sure that in strategic sectors

740
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,399
not in all sectors but in strategic

741
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,120
sectors we can

742
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,320
check nationally rdu level what is being

743
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,960
done by

744
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,200
third country investors like chinese

745
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,080
investors

746
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
we will have very important reform i

747
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,840
think proposed by the commission in the

748
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,880
coming weeks

749
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,360
a foreign subsidy mechanism which means

750
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,559
that when you are

751
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,600
a foreign a non-eu company

752
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,200
investing buying a company bidding for a

753
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,320
public procurement

754
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,480
in the eu we will make sure that you

755
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,600
don't have

756
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,000
subsidies so unfair competition from

757
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,360
your

758
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,320
home country china or others but china

759
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,360
so i think this

760
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,080
software has totally changed i think we

761
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,600
are not there yet

762
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,679
we are more united we are less naive but

763
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,520
we are probably not strong enough

764
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,320
in terms of trade policy in terms of

765
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,679
trade negotiations

766
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,360
there was a lot of talk about this

767
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,279
investment agreement

768
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,799
made with china at the principal level

769
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,399
last december it was criticized as too

770
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:01,679
weak or naive which i think is

771
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,520
interesting because now people even i

772
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,080
think business community ask for more

773
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,760
level playing field and somehow

774
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,679
protection with china

775
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,279
it is a step in the right direction but

776
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,440
probably now it's not seen as

777
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,080
enough and i think beyond the key issue

778
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,520
of human rights

779
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,120
of a international labor organization

780
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,720
convention that china will have to

781
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,279
ratify if it wants us to rectify this

782
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,919
agreement so it's not a given

783
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,440
beyond this we want more fairness

784
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,960
and so more defensive approach

785
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,799
more offensive approach as well from the

786
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,480
utah west china i think we are getting

787
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
in this direction

788
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,039
with this foreign mechanism with a new

789
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,480
screening mechanism that will have to

790
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,279
strengthen

791
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,120
so yes i hope that we can go in this

792
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
direction and work with the us in this

793
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,080
just to be clear on that i don't think

794
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,880
that we are

795
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,399
in a position of equidistance between

796
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,799
as eu between the u.s and china we want

797
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,159
to cooperate with china

798
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,080
on a lot of topics including trade but

799
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,520
also climate and so on

800
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
we have a no our own eu position which

801
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,760
is not necessarily the american position

802
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,720
but

803
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,600
our key partner of course for security

804
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
strategic approach but also for trade

805
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,200
and for multilateralism

806
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,799
is the u.s and we could work on this

807
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,559
right thank you it's a work in progress

808
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,520
indeed so we have

809
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,919
mrs hallmeyer who is back apparently i

810
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,039
think you're back can you hear us

811
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,640
we i i hear you but you can't hear me

812
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,080
then that's the problem

813
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,159
we have some problems today in brussels

814
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,520
um so so

815
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
back to my we had some problems admire

816
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,240
in other committees either

817
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,840
do you as agreed i was saying that the

818
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,200
use has agreed to spend billions on

819
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,679
recovery and i was asking you uh

820
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,679
what is the biggest obstacle to smooth

821
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,520
delivery of these funds and

822
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,120
i think you've pointed out that we have

823
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,640
to make sure that eu funds

824
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
are not channeled to people who are not

825
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,240
entitled to them

826
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
that has happened in the past is that a

827
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,600
serious risk

828
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
and how does do you work to prevent that

829
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,919
kind of things i'm thinking corruption

830
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,960
for example

831
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,279
i think the most important issue in our

832
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,039
first is

833
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,360
that we are really using the 750 billion

834
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,559
for innovation for research for recovery

835
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,720
and that it is really delivered to those

836
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,600
um

837
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,919
who need it or to those who are really

838
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,679
delivering in the area of research and

839
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,960
innovation

840
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,279
so corruption is an issue but it is not

841
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,159
the first issue

842
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,480
on rrf yes it is an issue for our

843
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,279
committee

844
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
and it's an important issue to really to

845
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,399
avoid

846
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:36,240
any kind of corruption and there we have

847
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,279
to do more we need more transparency

848
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,519
uh we need um at the end if we're

849
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,279
discussing digitalization

850
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,960
it's really very interesting that we

851
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,519
have no cross-border digitalization to

852
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,720
trace back european money because until

853
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,320
now the member states

854
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,039
don't agree with this um i think we

855
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:55,519
should

856
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,080
we should do it in a i think that it

857
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,399
would be of a cross-border

858
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,919
positive action to have a digitalized

859
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,519
system to trace back

860
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,840
as we are just discussing other issues

861
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,039
in digitalization

862
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,799
20 of the amount of

863
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,159
rrf are for um digitalization

864
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,640
so for innovation not only for control

865
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,320
but for real innovation in

866
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,640
the digital area and if we want to be

867
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,399
successful in the green deal

868
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,720
at the same time recovering then we need

869
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,159
a lot of innovation

870
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,559
and really a european initiative in in

871
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,080
the innovation area

872
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,320
therefore i really would appreciate it

873
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,120
very much

874
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,519
if member states would agree on more

875
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,480
financial means in the area of research

876
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,559
um you had talked about for example the

877
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,559
kubit-19 crisis

878
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,679
um we would not have a mrn

879
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,120
rna technology if europe wouldn't have

880
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,279
invested in this kind of technology it's

881
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,559
a up technology

882
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,960
so it's very interesting that now china

883
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,320
russia and

884
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,559
explicitly the united states are asking

885
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,240
for giving them the patents

886
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,960
i think if it would be if they would be

887
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,279
american patents and not european ones

888
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:07,840
they would

889
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,200
ask to open up i think we really have to

890
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,320
act together

891
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,799
europe can deliver if member states

892
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,240
agree on it

893
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,360
and if member states are not um for

894
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,240
example

895
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,679
in this vaccination area we saw uh for

896
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,799
example

897
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,480
um to give european union and their

898
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,159
responsibility but not the tools

899
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,399
so if member states did not order

900
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,279
vaccines

901
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,880
for example um then at the end

902
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,799
european union was responsible that the

903
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,480
vaccines were not there

904
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,039
so it was it is always mostly it is a

905
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,440
problem if the 27 and mr bone is right

906
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,320
when he's saying

907
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,600
we need to be more united in areas

908
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,799
where we have to be united and um

909
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,200
um where her mr close uh i'm i'm very

910
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,679
happy about it that he talked that not

911
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,840
there there shouldn't be this reflex

912
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,799
on um if we have a problem that the

913
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,000
first thing what we do

914
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,119
is closing the borders not talking to

915
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,399
each other not fair

916
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,918
finding uh strategic ways how to

917
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,760
to to solve problems at the borders

918
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,399
because i live nearby a border

919
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,280
so to be frank for us it was a huge

920
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,560
problem that suddenly

921
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,599
borders were close to czechia uh and for

922
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,879
all our

923
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,239
workers for the smaller companies

924
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,560
across border working every day it was

925
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,760
really a problem

926
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,719
so i think rrf should be used either for

927
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,280
this

928
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,239
for the issue that we should not know

929
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,399
any border anymore when we are working

930
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,839
together in economy in

931
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,719
in economic areas or in research areas

932
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,040
or

933
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,399
innovation areas i think you three

934
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,159
agree on that we have an interesting

935
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,760
question coming up from michelle

936
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,119
patrick concerning the need for an eu

937
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,480
investment plan

938
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,040
prime minister quote spoke yesterday at

939
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
globsec and he said that the recovery

940
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,079
plan was a

941
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,359
one-shot common eu debt project do you

942
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,280
see it as the same

943
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,079
mr close

944
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,680
well i can easily share this opinion of

945
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,160
chancellor kurtz uh i'm coming from the

946
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,680
party where where we are

947
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,440
uh quite hesitating to speak about uh

948
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,119
common debts in europe for

949
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,160
forever uh we believe that

950
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,800
pandemia needs to have special solutions

951
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,520
so okay

952
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,640
we agreed uh with the solution made

953
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,480
in the council during the july time but

954
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,000
uh

955
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,400
we need more than just a recovery and

956
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,079
resilience plan

957
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,960
for next couple of years and i guess

958
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,440
this

959
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,760
investment plan sounds okay we need to

960
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,000
we need to hear details because uh

961
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,560
devil is always hidden in the detail uh

962
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,480
and we need to discuss it uh very

963
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,400
precisely at the european level

964
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,640
what that investment plan uh should mean

965
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,599
but uh

966
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,400
as far as i know uh chancellor kurtz uh

967
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:02,880
he's

968
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,119
very like-minded uh with us in many

969
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,480
cases so

970
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,079
i believe he will come with the details

971
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,160
soon and uh it's one of the most

972
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,800
important partners i mean austria for us

973
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,920
uh hopefully they will count on us too

974
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,320
chancellor you're right i said pm um

975
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,040
okay

976
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,839
mr krustu bounce back on that um right

977
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,520
now a big flashy keyword for the

978
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,760
european in the european union

979
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,119
in most countries is strategic autonomy

980
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,720
what does that mean to you what's your

981
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,720
number one priority in that regard

982
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,320
is it tackling china the us or

983
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,520
russia for example

984
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,599
well uh i can easily tell you what the

985
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,240
strategic autonomy is not for me

986
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,359
uh first of all we need to fight against

987
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,400
protectionism

988
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
and uh uh kind of an interpreting

989
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,960
interventionism uh

990
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,079
we had a

991
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,040
possibility to to to deal with the last

992
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,320
couple of years

993
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,119
from one of our very important partners

994
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:03,520
and

995
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,640
uh i believe we need to use a single

996
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
market much more

997
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,440
to be more strategic autonomy uh to have

998
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,119
more strategic autonomy and to be more

999
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,640
strategic autonomous

1000
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,760
within the europe and uh i also believe

1001
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,160
that

1002
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
we need to have more resilience in

1003
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
europe so why not to speak about it

1004
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,000
it's a good idea especially after the

1005
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,359
experience of

1006
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,079
march 2020 musk diplomacy now vaccine

1007
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,680
diplomacy and many other

1008
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,560
diplomacies all around the world but uh

1009
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:32,960
let's

1010
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,880
speak very correctly that first of all

1011
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,040
we need to have a free market

1012
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,720
within the european union and also

1013
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,480
global free markets uh so

1014
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,440
in this case uh i'm the one who is very

1015
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,119
heavily supporting uh

1016
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,599
uh common voice of european countries

1017
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:48,880
against china

1018
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,119
and for this country it's even more

1019
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,320
important to speak

1020
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,400
with the common voice if it comes to the

1021
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,599
russia but

1022
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,079
much more in security issues than the

1023
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,079
economic one

1024
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,200
um the question for mrs olmeier now

1025
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,160
there was a recent um a recent and

1026
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,800
important

1027
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,520
agreement on a 15 percent minimum

1028
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,480
corporate tax

1029
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,119
uh that was decided at g7 level that

1030
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:13,839
would be

1031
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,920
i think a tangible achievement for eu

1032
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,760
citizens avoiding a race to the bottom

1033
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,000
in

1034
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,800
in corporate taxation and once again on

1035
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,760
this topic

1036
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,280
there seems to be it seems to be a long

1037
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,119
shot for the eu to find a common

1038
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:25,920
position

1039
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
on that with you know ireland warning

1040
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,040
that it would make

1041
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,640
its economy less attractive to

1042
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,160
businesses do you see

1043
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,440
a way forward to for the you to stand

1044
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,000
together

1045
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,680
on the issue of corporate taxation

1046
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,240
i think it's absolutely necessary

1047
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,480
because a fair taxation

1048
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,320
is a necessary tool so if um

1049
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,119
companies are only looking um where they

1050
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,640
have zero taxation

1051
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,920
and a maximum of profit um but no

1052
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,960
social security um no

1053
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,160
fair rules between the companies and i

1054
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,800
cannot explain to a smaller company

1055
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,760
not being a digital company as google or

1056
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,880
facebook or some chinese companies

1057
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,400
they pay them more taxes in percentages

1058
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,000
than um the big ones amazon mr bezos or

1059
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,960
whatever

1060
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,079
so i'm um i'm absolutely

1061
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,480
friendly-minded to big companies that's

1062
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,880
not my problem but a fair taxation is a

1063
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,079
necessary tool

1064
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,560
and explicitly for europe we need more

1065
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,079
own resources

1066
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,040
debts are not a solution and if we have

1067
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,960
companies

1068
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,400
paying 0.5 taxes 8

1069
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,359
taxes percent taxes and at the same time

1070
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,720
other companies

1071
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,960
explicitly the small and medium-sized

1072
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,760
are paying

1073
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,040
30 25 or 35

1074
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,079
or even more then this is not a fair

1075
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,280
taxation so i think a basis or a

1076
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,440
minimum tax in the corporate tax area

1077
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,280
and explicitly in digital tax area

1078
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,359
is absolutely necessary and it should be

1079
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:08,640
a european one

1080
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,279
and not nationally nationally

1081
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,560
once because these companies are acting

1082
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,200
really european and worldwide so we need

1083
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
a common basis for this not ireland

1084
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,599
against germany or france or france

1085
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,640
against the

1086
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,800
netherlands and luxembourg we need a

1087
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,000
common basis

1088
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,480
that a minimum tax is absolutely

1089
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,800
necessary

1090
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,880
mr boone you know ireland very well i

1091
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,240
think you studied there

1092
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,079
do you think there there's a way to find

1093
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,520
a common stance

1094
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,160
on this minimum corporate tax level i

1095
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,599
hope so

1096
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,319
i hope so uh yes no i'm optimistic we

1097
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,079
can find a

1098
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,319
unanimous agreement because we need it

1099
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,000
first thing is i i regret we

1100
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,280
are blocked or slowed down by unanimity

1101
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,200
in this area

1102
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,160
um there are now two areas basically in

1103
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,200
the

1104
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
eu decision making which are by

1105
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,560
unanimity votes

1106
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,200
tax issues and foreign policy i think on

1107
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,760
both

1108
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,640
sides we will need to unlock this but

1109
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,000
regarding ireland we will have tough

1110
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,920
discussions obviously what is the issue

1111
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,400
if we

1112
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,160
think we should always try to understand

1113
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,319
it's not about teaching a lesson to

1114
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,319
everyone to anyone

1115
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,800
why does islands have this position

1116
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,000
because they have

1117
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,599
had and it's true difficulties

1118
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,000
because of their geography because a

1119
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
smaller market concern

1120
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,680
to get full access to the single market

1121
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,560
two or three decades ago and they

1122
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,760
developed a model

1123
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,480
which was based on this competitiveness

1124
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,319
what we would call now tax dumping but

1125
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,119
which was

1126
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,040
a competitive advantage they probably

1127
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,240
need it

1128
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,560
i think now also through european

1129
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,240
solidarity

1130
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
through what we displayed in the brexit

1131
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,680
negotiation what we

1132
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,319
have concretely shown with european

1133
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,680
funds

1134
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
ireland has developed to a very

1135
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,720
impressive level

1136
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,280
it's a success story in europe and

1137
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,640
that's the only one with a very

1138
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,160
impressive success story

1139
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,480
and i think and i have the feeling

1140
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,920
ireland knows it

1141
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,119
they will have to move probably not

1142
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,480
overnight but to another economic

1143
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,079
model which would include

1144
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,720
to be more convergent regarding taxes to

1145
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,520
accept

1146
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,839
evolutions i know it's difficult it's

1147
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:29,599
more difficult to accept

1148
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,400
such a move than it is for france and

1149
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,680
for other countries

1150
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,839
it is but we will need that and i

1151
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,599
i don't want to threaten or to have a

1152
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,119
kind of conflict on this but we will

1153
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,960
need ireland to move

1154
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,800
and i think we have to explain why we

1155
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,000
have to convince

1156
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,119
we have to to say it

1157
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,960
vocally we cannot as eu because in the

1158
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,599
end it would be

1159
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,720
you fail now that there is

1160
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,599
an international consensus i hope or at

1161
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,280
least an american move

1162
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
we cannot fail as eu on this reform

1163
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,040
it's not i think conceivable it would

1164
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,760
not be

1165
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,560
understood i think starting with our

1166
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,200
citizens

1167
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,240
all across the eu even in ireland i

1168
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,079
think

1169
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,119
we have been as europeans leading

1170
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,839
this debate we should not forget about

1171
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:27,280
it we have been leading this debate when

1172
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,319
the u.s was

1173
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:32,480
blocking it for four years now

1174
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,119
that's good the u.s is moving it is the

1175
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,599
u.s moving to the

1176
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,920
european consensus or european overall

1177
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:40,960
position

1178
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,240
which cannot waste or spoil this moment

1179
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,480
we have a window of opportunity which is

1180
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,599
probably

1181
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,480
unique extremely positive very highly

1182
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,079
expected i think by citizens

1183
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,800
we cannot miss it we only have a couple

1184
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,920
of minutes left

1185
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,560
um so i'll take some questions from uh

1186
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,000
first from the app and then perhaps from

1187
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
the audience if anyone has questions

1188
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,480
um a question from iman mahana i hope i

1189
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,800
i'm not mispronouncing uh the name

1190
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,200
given the economic emergencies inside

1191
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,720
the eu can they also

1192
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,040
can the eu also deliver on international

1193
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,839
development

1194
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,319
development eight commitments especially

1195
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,040
towards

1196
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,440
its neighbors in the south and in the

1197
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,319
east

1198
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:23,520
um and uh i want to add a guess that

1199
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,359
at the g7 summit where i was a couple of

1200
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,720
days ago um

1201
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,319
there was a big promise on vaccine

1202
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,400
donations from european countries as

1203
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,319
well but it was not as high as expected

1204
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:32,960
initially

1205
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,800
uh perhaps the question for mr cruz do

1206
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
you think the eu uh

1207
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,040
should and can keep its goals in terms

1208
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,480
of development aid

1209
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,200
given the emergency inside the eu

1210
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,240
of course and uh

1211
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,079
everybody knows that slovakia is a huge

1212
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,280
proponent of uh

1213
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,520
enlargement of the european union

1214
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,800
especially if it comes to the western

1215
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,440
balkan

1216
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,440
and uh let's not forget our very

1217
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,680
important neighborhood ukraine

1218
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,720
and uh we understand that uh for

1219
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,480
some countries like france for instance

1220
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,760
also uh

1221
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,240
africa and mid-east is very important

1222
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,040
too

1223
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,359
uh let's discuss this topic also if we

1224
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,760
will uh broaden it to the topic of

1225
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,680
uh migration for instance which is also

1226
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,839
quite sensitive in the european union

1227
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:22,079
so uh we are ready for such a discussion

1228
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:23,839
it's very very important for us and

1229
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,240
uh i'm very grateful especially for

1230
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,000
instance to the portuguese presidency

1231
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,359
now that uh they

1232
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,480
dealt with this topic very openly

1233
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,400
and finally we are having gac format

1234
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:36,960
meeting

1235
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,160
uh next tuesday uh where we will open uh

1236
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,440
next chapters with

1237
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,560
montenegro and serbia to discuss and i

1238
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:44,960
hope

1239
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
and i really hope that we'll move

1240
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,000
forward also with

1241
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,160
north macedonia and albania this is very

1242
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,599
important for this country it's a top

1243
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,240
priority of

1244
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,040
our foreign policy and we are also

1245
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,920
somehow active

1246
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,920
also in some other countries which are

1247
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,440
very important as i already mentioned

1248
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,000
for the other

1249
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,800
european countries we are having our

1250
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,520
forces in mali for instance

1251
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,160
we used to be very active in mid-east

1252
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:08,960
before

1253
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,200
so we understand how important this is

1254
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,160
for europe

1255
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
and europe need to be a global player in

1256
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,880
this case and uh i hope uh

1257
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,280
we are having plenty of opportunities

1258
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,640
how to be a global player

1259
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,920
so let's use them uh otherwise uh we

1260
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,400
then need to just manage uh uh the

1261
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,280
damage

1262
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,520
like the migration of 2015 2016.

1263
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,160
we are slowly running out of time uh

1264
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,200
perhaps uh mr hallmeyer you want to have

1265
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,359
a few words to close the session we have

1266
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,119
about one minute left if you you have

1267
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,240
basically 30 seconds

1268
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:46,400
that's very nice thank you very much i

1269
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
think we are already successful if you

1270
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,480
see the kovacs initiative

1271
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,040
but we are not moving strategically mr

1272
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:53,760
bone was

1273
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,960
referring to it before i think we need

1274
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,640
really to be strategic

1275
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,520
in the development area either because

1276
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,040
if we are not doing it

1277
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,520
then others will do it um they are not a

1278
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,040
risk but they don't feel to be

1279
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,440
responsible for their own populations

1280
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,240
but they move very strategically

1281
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,480
strategically in the european union and

1282
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,359
try

1283
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,079
to bash the european union back or to

1284
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,000
separate european union

1285
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,760
or to diminue our our our power

1286
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,319
so i think it's very necessary to move

1287
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,079
strategically in the development sector

1288
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,920
thank you mrs hallmeyer and thank you

1289
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,359

1290
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:34,720
technical difficulties
