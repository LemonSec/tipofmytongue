i would like to think that they saved

16
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,000

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
uh the united nations climate change

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:30,880
conference

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,079
um otherwise known as cop26 will be

22
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,479
taking place in glasgow and this is the

23
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,439
moment of course

24
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,840
for countries to submit stronger climate

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,640
commitments

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,399
uh in other words um what we call ndc's

27
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
nationally determined contributions now

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,159
yes the united states

29
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,880
um has rejoined the paris climate

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,240
accords but

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,640
the title of our panel is political

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,719
leadership on climate change

33
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,079
united we stand question mark

34
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,159
question mark so there's uncertainty

35
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,920
about how unified

36
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,439
the world is on this topic

37
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,639
and what will the ramifications of

38
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,080
disunity be

39
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,400
so we will be uh bringing our audience

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
into the discussion

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,440
um the audience in the room that'll

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,720
happen later on

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,440

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,519
european climate foundation

66
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
so jennifer i will start with you um

67
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,120
what is your reaction to the

68
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
announcement that was made

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
on sunday at the g7 meeting where the

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,640
leaders

71
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,519
did say that they are boosting their uh

72
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,640
climate finance

73
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,079
pledges what do you think about that

74
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,560
well i think unfortunately the g7 as a

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
whole was

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
a big disappointment for both climate

77
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
and for equity across the board

78
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,599
the financing component of it was

79
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,720
was very very weak we didn't see very

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,360
many new

81
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,920
commitments coming in to fill the

82
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,920
pledges of the 100 billion that

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,920
developed countries had pledged years

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,959
ago

85
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,599
and on the climate part as well yes

86
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,120
there were good directional statements

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,959
and yes it's good that

88
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,319
we're in a different situation and

89
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,920
having a president of the united states

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,680
who understands the science

91
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,080
but we needed deadlines we needed plans

92
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,159
for those g7 countries of when they're

93
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,439
going to

94
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
phase out fossil fuels when they are

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
going to phase out the

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,599
internal combustion engine and we didn't

97
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,720
see that

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,400
we saw a great commitment for

99
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
international coal financing and phasing

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,280
that out

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,639
of biology seven uh by next year uh but

102
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,519
the vagueness

103
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,918
is just doesn't match the urgency at

104
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,400
this point in time

105
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,199
david how would you respond to that why

106
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,080
didn't

107
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
president biden and the other leaders

108
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,240
you know make a more detailed commitment

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
well thank you so much for having me and

110
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,120
i'm i'm

111
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,000
so pleased to be able to uh to join this

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
year's summit virtually i hope to

113
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,040
to be able to be there in person soon um

114
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,840
uh you know let me just say that i i

115
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
personally thought this was actually a

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,840
a a quite productive year for the g7

117
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,000
um uh in terms of uh international coal

118
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
finance uh

119
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,440
as as was mentioned um there was a very

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,960
strong signal that was not at all a

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,520
foregone conclusion going into the g7

122
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,240
uh and thanks to uh i think some very

123
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,919
constructive diplomacy we were able to

124
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,759
get a very strong signal

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,000
um that there will be an absolute and

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
unequivocal end

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,840
to international financing of unabated

128
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,759
uh overseas coal

129
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,240
this year um it's a very strong signal

130
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
and now it's important to take that

131
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,880
uh and depress the other large remaining

132
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,639
financiers globally

133
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,919
uh to stop exporting unabated

134
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,479
uh emissions from the the dirtiest uh

135
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,520
most polluting

136
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,000
uh power source that we have globally

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,840
which prevents other countries

138
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,520
uh the recipient countries from really

139
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,199
being able to um to step

140
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,440
up and to lay out the climate ambition

141
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,639
and climate action

142
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,479
uh that oftentimes they they would like

143
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,080
to do now when it

144
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,440
comes to uh domestic uh emissions and

145
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,880
and domestic sectors

146
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,440
you know let me just say that um i

147
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,039
thought again there was actually some

148
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
some strong coordination across multiple

149
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120
different sectoral initiatives

150
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
so in transport the united states and

151
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,440
other g several other g7 members joined

152
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,080
the

153
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,560
zero emission vehicle uh transitions

154
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,360
council

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,880
the united states is going to be we're

156
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,360
only 100 days a little bit more than 100

157
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,199
days into this new administration

158
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,039
but i know that colleagues at epa

159
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
department of transportation

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,039
are hard at work rolling out uh domestic

161
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,120
policies on the transportation front

162
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,759
and we uh we look forward to watching

163
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
that space and uh as those get rolled

164
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,960
out i think you'll see

165
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
even more uh specific policy

166
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,039
um action in the united states being

167
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,880
added to the overall vision set by the

168
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,919
g7

169
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,680
the power sector the united states

170
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,240
continued to lay out its vision

171
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,600
for a carbon pollution free power sector

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
by 2035.

173
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,160
now the perhaps not all g7 members were

174
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,080
able to agree on that but we still got a

175
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
call for an overwhelmingly decarbonized

176
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,160
power sector in the 2030s

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,160
that speaks for itself the necessary

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
technologies will need to be deployed

179
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
uh to the grid um we'll need to deploy

180
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
uh and scale up new technologies that

181
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
help us address emissions at

182
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,759
existing uh fossil plants if they are to

183
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,680
um to to have a role to play in that

184
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,479
decarbonized power sector in the 2030s

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,240
and we have to have a decarbonized power

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,520
sector in the 2030s if we're going to

187
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
meet our 2050 goals

188
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,440
and then finally let me just note that i

189
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,280
think what was perhaps most notable is

190
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,039
that this g7 didn't just tackle the

191
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,400
low-hanging fruit

192
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,960
or the easy opportunities but also went

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,440
to where

194
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,199
emissions abatement is actually quite

195
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
difficult the g7 rolled out for the

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,199
first time ever a standing group

197
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,520
a standing body on climate and clean

198
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,840
energy the g7 industrial decarbonization

199
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,720
agenda

200
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,280
which is focused on the hardest to abate

201
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,240
sectors

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,199
and both supply side technological push

203
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,039
as well as demand side pole for clean

204
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,599
energy

205
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,479
uh technologies for green products such

206
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,639
as green cement green steel etc

207
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,039
which will help lower the cost of those

208
00:07:59,039 --> 00:07:59,680
uh

209
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
green products and processes that will

210
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,080
be needed to decarbonize the industrial

211
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,560
sector

212
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,800
which is oftentimes the the most

213
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
difficult and the most expensive

214
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
in which to reduce emissions and when we

215
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
do that is the g7 we

216
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,840
lower the cost of decarbonization not

217
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,440
just for ourselves and our own countries

218
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,400
our own economies

219
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
but also for economies around the world

220
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,440
um

221
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
and so i think that's going to be a very

222
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,720
important step in showing the path

223
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,440
forward

224
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
in sectors like chemical steel cement

225
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,120
fertilizers etc

226
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
so i saw quite a bit of good in this

227
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,039
year's g7 i think that these are not

228
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,279
easy wins these are hard-fought wins

229
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,679
we have much more to do the proof will

230
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,519
be in the actions that each country

231
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,799
takes to implement this

232
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,240
uh this broad vision and some of the

233
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,839
very specific targets and commitments

234
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,679
and goals that have been set forward

235
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,320
we have to do more but we also must set

236
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
the tone and carry it forward into the

237
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,959
g20

238
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,519
through cop26 and beyond this year in

239
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,240
multilateral fora as well

240
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,080
thank you david jennifer and david can

241
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
you both hear me

242
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,000
can you hear me is my microphone working

243
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
great you've got me jennifer i wondered

244
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,360
i'd like to take on some of the things

245
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
that david mentioned he talked about

246
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,440
pressing

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,839
um on coal who do we need to press

248
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
well i think um first of all i think

249
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,360
that

250
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
there's some benchmarks that are being

251
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,000
set and i i wanted to take um

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,320
i mean in europe i think uh it's clear

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,720
that we need to press a faster

254
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,800
decarbonization the international energy

255
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
agency has noted that developed

256
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,320
countries need to phase out coal by

257
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,839
2030.

258
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
right so it's good the 2030s is that

259
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,000
that's the problem

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
every we have in this decade in the next

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
decade we have to

262
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,720
actually according to the energy

263
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
international energy agency phase out

264
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
that coal and in

265
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
in slovakia i just wanted to call out

266
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,399
the the government here and and say

267
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,760
they're setting a great pace of

268
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,000
sustaining a 2023 coal phase

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,480
out and so that means that other

270
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
countries in the region like poland like

271
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,480
like czechia like bulgaria romania need

272
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,160
to move in that direction

273
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,360
obviously also uh developing countries

274
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,200
need to move forward and

275
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,320
included in that is of course china

276
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
and looking to see how china which it's

277
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,839
so clearly in its national interest for

278
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,720
air pollution

279
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,360
reasons for climate change reasons uh

280
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
economic reasons

281
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,920
uh to also be uh both stopping the

282
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
the funding of coal internationally and

283
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,519
joining that g7

284
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,760
uh call hopefully i'll call not just

285
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
unabated

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,800
call that that's a important little word

287
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,560
for people in the audience who

288
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,920
uh follow this stuff um but also

289
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
um their domestic coal so you need to

290
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,360
look

291
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,000
uh in that space i think in india you're

292
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,640
seeing a

293
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,079
tremendous uh progress on solar and just

294
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,519
seeing how much

295
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,480
better for lives and for the for the

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,640
well-being of people and the planet that

297
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,760
moving into a renewable energy future

298
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
uh is important and that's why i think

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,079
it's key to focus on the technologies

300
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,519
that we have now

301
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,560
for those coal nations and those that

302
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,519
include renewable energy it doesn't

303
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,360
include carbon capture and storage it

304
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,959
doesn't include air capture

305
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,720
it doesn't include many of these

306
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
technologies that are

307
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
more what we would call false solutions

308
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
biofuels and really doubling down on

309
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,959
that and

310
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,640
uh the good news is that the prices have

311
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,160
dropped dramatically

312
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,760
the good news is those are great job

313
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
creation opportunities this is also

314
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,839
about job creation

315
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,680
and really being an economic driver for

316
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,040
a much more

317
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,160
prosperous and beneficial uh economy

318
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,760
those are some of the places we need to

319
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,440
be focusing on

320
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,519
thank you jennifer and i'm very excited

321
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,480
to say that

322
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,320
la ros tubiano has been able to join us

323
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,480
i'm so glad that the technology is

324
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,600
working with us

325
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,279
um i know that you've missed what uh

326
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,279
both jennifer and david have just said

327
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,959
but we were initially starting out by

328
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,399
discussing the commitments

329
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,160
made by the g7 um on sunday

330
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,079
and jennifer said it was a big

331
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,519
disappointment how how would you

332
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
characterize them the commitments on

333
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,440
climate

334
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
uh yes i i think uh

335
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,560
the good thing of course and i'm sure

336
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,399
jennifer referred to that

337
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,240
is having all g7 countries which was not

338
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,680
there before committing to net zero by

339
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,800
2050

340
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,680
but what is more worrying is even if

341
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,320
there are

342
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,200
good progress on some of the g7 members

343
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,560
particular uk

344
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,279
us of course and the other members of

345
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,880
the european union that are part of the

346
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,560
g7

347
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,399
we still of course need particularly a

348
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,639
country like japan and and just to go

349
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,480
forth and probably

350
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,279
what is missing is a uh the good thing

351
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,160
is

352
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,839
they decided uh to stop funding

353
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,279
uh the su to support export to

354
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,680
any core technology which is this is

355
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,560
good

356
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,120
but they didn't they were not clear

357
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,680
finally

358
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,920
with a precise date of phasing out coal

359
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,040
in the domestic field and it's it's

360
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,000
important because we

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
know and of course g7 referred to ipcc

362
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,399
they believe in science

363
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,480
this says that we have to go to net zero

364
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,920
by 2050

365
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,839
and you know there is no miracle and

366
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,600
unfortunately there is nothing that will

367
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
happen

368
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,120
so in a way uh spontaneously in 2049

369
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,600
so this has it's a milestone that the

370
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,680
pathway has to be consistent with what

371
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,839
can be achieved progressively

372
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,079
and this is halving emission global

373
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,120
emission by

374
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
2030 and of course it's normally much

375
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,480
more than that for

376
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,639
the developed countries of the g7 so

377
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,240
callies cannot be

378
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,959
part of the picture uh and they have to

379
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,360
set

380
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
a final date so i understand the

381
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,440
problems

382
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,720
the the the enormous elements of

383
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,760
transition for

384
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,079
a number of regions that are really the

385
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,440
economy based on coal

386
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
but that's why it's not good delay

387
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,399
that's what is good really to anticipate

388
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,399
what has to be done to accompany the

389
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,560
region to diversify

390
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
their their activities and not only of

391
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,320
course the source of energy

392
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
it's important to see how you retrain

393
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,760
workers

394
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,120
uh and and that if we delay that the

395
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,800
shock the economic shock

396
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,320
will happen much in a much tougher way

397
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,040
so this that's where i i was

398
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,399
disappointed

399
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,240
by the lack of clarity of the g7

400
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,880
and i hope they would in a way take

401
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,680
these

402
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,079
six months to towards glasgow to be much

403
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,519
more precise

404
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,399
uh on a number of sectoral elements by

405
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,000
the way because they have to say

406
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,040
things very clearly on transport uh and

407
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,639
beyond energy so

408
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,440
again good that the direction of travel

409
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
is net zero by 2050

410
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,920
uh but what is very important is a clear

411
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,680
pathway and this for the moment

412
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,360
is not there see um david i'd like you

413
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,199
to elaborate a little bit you on one

414
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,279
point that you mentioned um you talked

415
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,440
about by 2035 and

416
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,959
and i guess jennifer implied that wasn't

417
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,440
soon enough that the u.s power um

418
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,800
grid the power structure would be

419
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,959
decarbonized but and in large part by

420
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,800
relying on new technologies

421
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,279
or but or is the u.s relying too heavily

422
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,279
on technologies that don't even exist

423
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,519
yet

424
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600
i uh that's a confirmation

425
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,199
i understand um

426
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,360
this could be for david also this is a

427
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,199
question for david to elaborate just a

428
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:31,600
moment

429
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,199
thank you can you hear me david

430
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,920
thank you let me just say i i think we

431
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,800
uh

432
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
we absolutely already have technologies

433
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,959
today that we can deploy to reduce

434
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,800
emissions in the power sector we can get

435
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,199
extremely far with uh just existing

436
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,480
technologies that we have today

437
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,279
even as we need to absolutely continue

438
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
to innovate technologies that we'll need

439
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
to reach deeper and deeper levels of

440
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,839
decarbonization

441
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,839
decades into the future it's a false

442
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,440
dichotomy to think about

443
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,759
uh innovation versus deployment as some

444
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,480
sort of uh

445
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,759
choice that you need to make between the

446
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,680
two in fact one of the best things we

447
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,279
can do to drive further innovation in

448
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,800
clean energy technologies

449
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,839
is deploy at scale today this is why the

450
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,680
binding administration is doing things

451
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,800
like setting the

452
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,120
hydrogen earth shock goal the goal of

453
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,920
achieving one dollar per one kilogram

454
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,759
hydrogen in one decade

455
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,040
one four one in one for the first

456
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,639
element of the periodic table

457
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,399
clean hydrogen which we're going to need

458
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,759
in order to help

459
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,000
not only decarbonize power but more

460
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,519
importantly to decarbonize heavy

461
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,720
industry

462
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
some long distance or heavy transport

463
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
etcetera

464
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,320
but the point is we get there as well by

465
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,519
deploying

466
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,680
renewables by deploying clean energy

467
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,959
technologies

468
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,320
any zero emissions technology we welcome

469
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,639
because it can help create the the power

470
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,920
production base the clean power

471
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,000
production base that can help drive

472
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,920
green hydrogen and other clean hydrogen

473
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
technologies into the system

474
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
so this is what we mean is that it's not

475
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,759
just what we do in labs

476
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,439
it's also about innovation through

477
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,760
deployment innovation through learning

478
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,679
and uh it's why you see this

479
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,199
administration only

480
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,679
100 plus days into the biden harris

481
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,559
administration

482
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,400
moving swiftly with the american jobs

483
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
plan with multiple other vehicles from

484
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,280
making

485
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
major investments in the energy

486
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,240
transition in a way that empowers

487
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,039
workers

488
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,039
and doing so also with a mind towards

489
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,319
both uh

490
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,240
going full speed on the technologies we

491
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
have today today to decarbonize

492
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
continuing to work on promising

493
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
technologies that may give us new

494
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
solutions in the future

495
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,679
but not letting the excitement we have

496
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,320
about

497
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
tomorrow's technologies and about

498
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,960
technologies that are close to

499
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,760
commercial

500
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
scale but not quite there yet not

501
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
letting that prevent us from also moving

502
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,520
swiftly ahead with the technologies we

503
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,280
we already have today in many parts of

504
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,200
the united states it's more economic

505
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
um uh to to deploy new renewables than

506
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,679
let's say

507
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,520
even to continue running existing fossil

508
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,799
resources um

509
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,200
and so uh you know the market is already

510
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,640
sending these signals to us

511
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,400
we just need to embrace it move forward

512
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,080
with policy and do so

513
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
in a way which seizes economic

514
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,679
opportunity and prosperity

515
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,720
uh and then shares that in a uh uh you

516
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,559
know in a very inclusive fashion

517
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
across multiple different uh you know

518
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,840
communities and with with american

519
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,280
workers

520
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,200
jennifer i'd like to look ahead now to

521
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,799
to cop 26.

522
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,360
what are you feeling what is your mood

523
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,160
are you

524
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
optimistic or are you pessimistic and

525
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,320
and what have we learned

526
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,080
um what lessons lauren do you think you

527
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,280
can apply based on what we've

528
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,000
experienced

529
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600
over the recent years since paris

530
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,919
well i guess i'm optimistic because i

531
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,960
see so many people involved i see

532
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,559
if you look at movements around the

533
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,360
world whether it be

534
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,679
connected to the climate crisis whether

535
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,039
it be connected to

536
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,880
racial justice black lives matters

537
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,080
whether it be relation

538
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,720
you know to vaccine equity you see

539
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,559
people who are getting engaged who are

540
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,240
standing up and who are really fighting

541
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,679
for a better world and i think you're

542
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,200
seeing that

543
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
in a way through elections uh it's not

544
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
often that you have you know a youth

545
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,520
movement that

546
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
gives a mandate to a new european

547
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,720
government you see

548
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,679
a new u.s government with certainly uh

549
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,320
although

550
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,000
i obviously think it needs to be further

551
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
it's you know president biden ran on the

552
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,720
most

553
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,799
uh ambitious climate plan that we've

554
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,160
ever seen

555
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,880
you see people um standing up in in

556
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,679
poland

557
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,280
for example farmers fighting so that

558
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,200
there aren't new coal mines that's what

559
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
gives me really hope and optimism and i

560
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
think that will continue into glasgow

561
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,799
and certainly beyond

562
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,480
and it's an understanding that we really

563
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,919
need to change the

564
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
rules of the system that that there's

565
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,960
something not working that the

566
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,080
short-term

567
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,200
uh kind of economic benefits or

568
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,160
uh are are coming ahead of really taking

569
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
care of people and the planet

570
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
i think where i'm concerned obviously is

571
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,760
the is the pace and scale of change

572
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,039
that's required to

573
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,120
avoid complete climate chaos and that's

574
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
why i come back to dates

575
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,559
um uh i think we need to see in glasgow

576
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,760
a stepping up of of all countries to

577
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,559
the command commensurate needs that the

578
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,400
scientific community is telling us right

579
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,919
the laurels mentioned that

580
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,039
the having of emissions by 2030 with the

581
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,600
major lead by developed countries but

582
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
also

583
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,400
developing countries coming forward on

584
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,679
that and

585
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,280
we still have a ways to go there and i

586
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,760
think a key piece is really going to be

587
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
about solidarity with developing

588
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,480
countries

589
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
and that also goes across the board i

590
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,679
think if one message for

591
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
for our viewers you know vaccine equity

592
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,840
and supporting the

593
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,320
the trips uh proposal in the wto of

594
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,280
south africa

595
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,039
and uh india as the united states has

596
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,559
done is a key part

597
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,000
of developing countries feeling

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,640
solidarity and support in tackling these

599
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,919
crises climate and

600
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,200
a pandemic right now lawrence how would

601
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,320
you characterize

602
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,080
your mood um it's interesting i was

603
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,840
listening to a speech you gave

604
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,200
in the fall in i think it was

605
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,679
in poland and you talked about how the

606
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,600
united states yes had

607
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,240
backed out of the kyoto protocol um you

608
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,520
know had quit the paris

609
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,880
agreement um now the us is back in the

610
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,360
game

611
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,280
so so do you have optimism are you do

612
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,480
can you count on the u.s now

613
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,440
of course yes of course we we cannot but

614
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,480
rejoice

615
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,080
from not only well mainly because of

616
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,799
course

617
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,720
u.s very quickly that was i think the

618
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,960
first measure that president biden took

619
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,600
to come back to paris agreement they

620
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,000
where

621
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,159
u.s has been of course instrumental

622
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
together with many other countries to

623
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,280
in a way to agree to to build so that of

624
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,000
course was a very

625
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,320
good new and in a way we we have to

626
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
recognize that the

627
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
previous administration has done a lot

628
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,880
of damages

629
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
not because the paris agreement has

630
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,480
exploded it hasn't

631
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,720
but because in a way it has slowed down

632
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
many efforts in many countries

633
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,640
i'm thinking of australia i'm thinking

634
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,080
of brazil

635
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,799
i'm even thinking in mexico so this was

636
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,440
a

637
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,520
bad factor so it's a very positive

638
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,640
factor to see

639
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,960
the biden administration coming in with

640
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,480
as jennifer morgan said

641
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,520
the most encompassing ambitious climate

642
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,120
plan that we have ever seen in the

643
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,559
united states so

644
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,320
just 100 percent happy of that um

645
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,799
never nevertheless and not in that of

646
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,080
course a responsibility

647
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
of all the concern we may have for

648
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,919
glasgow

649
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,320
and again i do recognize that there is a

650
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
movement which again i would not have

651
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,080
anticipated so much

652
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,559
when we sign up the paris agreement we

653
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,000
put net zero emission by

654
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,919
2050 or soon after as a goal

655
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,039
and now it has in a way diffused that

656
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,520
benchmark for many many actors across

657
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,240
the system

658
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,360
and now the ipcc reinforcing that

659
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,200
to get really to protect the global rise

660
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,080
of temperature

661
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,000
from from beyond 1.5 degrees c

662
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,159
we have really to do that as early as

663
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,039
possible

664
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,039
and this is a positive element is that

665
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,280
this benchmark is now

666
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,880
the benchmark even if of course

667
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
countries or government or business are

668
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,760
not only

669
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,960
able to say how they would achieve that

670
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,799
the concern is in my view the problem of

671
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,080
a rising divide which has

672
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,520
how was overcome in paris

673
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,240
between north uh north developed

674
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,360
countries and the south

675
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,880
and the global south it's part of the of

676
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,080
course a coveted crisis

677
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,799
and the debt crisis it's part of the

678
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,880
difficulty of having any sensible

679
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,919
negotiation because of the context

680
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,240
it's part of course of the issue again

681
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,919
and again on climate finance

682
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,799
because again you know insisting on

683
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,720
constructing as a private fund it was

684
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,320
absolutely fine because we need this

685
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,880
private money to invest to be invested

686
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
in renewable energy in sustainable

687
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,159
transport etc

688
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,919
but for many developing countries the

689
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,200
connection with these

690
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,279
trillions are not is not happening

691
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,559
because there is

692
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,400
access to capital markets is not there

693
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,120
for them so there is an element of

694
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,159
uh distrust that has mounted of course

695
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,760
was very strong during

696
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,559
the previous u.s administration is now

697
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,360
growing

698
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,120
and we haven't find the the signs

699
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,919
action that can you know amend that

700
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:26,720
divide

701
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,520
and i think that's a more urgent thing i

702
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,200
i told that

703
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,679
to many of your colleagues that i think

704
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,279
the uk presidency

705
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,039
everybody has to talk to developing

706
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,640
countries first to show

707
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,240
what kind of solidarity we can

708
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,640
demonstrate and prepare for glasgow

709
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,720
it's like offering really a serious

710
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,880
investment package for africa for

711
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,039
example or renewable energy or

712
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,039
facilitating for india the access to

713
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,279
capital market to deliver their goals

714
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:58,480
so we need these actions that

715
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
trust is building up and then every

716
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,480
country because every country has to

717
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,840
make efforts

718
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,840
uh but every country has to feel that

719
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,039
they are not alone

720
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,640
and it's not a rich people

721
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,360
game or rich people get club and it's

722
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,080
really important

723
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,200
that we see that in a very

724
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,080
comprehensive way it's important that g7

725
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,200
make advance

726
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,760
it's important that g20 adjust again

727
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,520
commit and it can be a very

728
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,799
positive move on the g20 side if things

729
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,240
aren't going well

730
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
but we need a very inclusive process

731
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,000
because i can remember

732
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
the ambitions paris agreement was a

733
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,840
result of the pressure

734
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,440
of small island state and the less

735
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,960
developed countries

736
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,080
the leadership is there as well and many

737
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,559
times

738
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,520
we forget that the leadership comes from

739
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:47,919
small

740
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
small countries small power in a way in

741
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:50,960
the big

742
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,520
game of geopolitics and i think that's a

743
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,960
message i i really

744
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,360
we we should really make an effort to

745
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,400
make this

746
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,440
real by glasgow david i'd love to give

747
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
you a chance to respond to

748
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,760
uh laws to jennifer and and just to also

749
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,240
help

750
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,559
us understand what is the united states

751
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,480
doing to help bridge that trust gap

752
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,400
thank you very much i mean we're in many

753
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,000
ways we're where we are

754
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,559
even with a passing shot at addressing

755
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,799
this climate crisis because of the

756
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,440
uh the hard work of lawrence and and and

757
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,400
colleagues uh

758
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,120
you know years ago with uh um at the

759
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,880
instantiation of the paris agreement the

760
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,640
hard work that led up to it so

761
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,120
i know we're all very grateful for uh

762
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,559
for for everything that

763
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,240
that has been done to date to give us

764
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,760
the framework in which we can work to

765
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
raise global ambition which is exactly

766
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,240
what

767
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
this administration and secretary kerry

768
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,440
and his role as special presidential

769
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,279
envoy for climate is doing

770
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,440
now when it comes to climate finance um

771
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,840
there's clearly

772
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,559
uh you know a lot of a lot of time to

773
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,440
make up

774
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
a lot of lost opportunities to make up

775
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,120
and this administration again just

776
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,360
a little bit over 100 days in is working

777
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,279
to do that president biden's laid out a

778
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:03,840
plan

779
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,559
to double climate finance u.s climate

780
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,840
finance

781
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,799
to triple adaptation finance which is

782
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,400
very important that we scale up there's

783
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,080
not enough adaptation finance going

784
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,559
around and the us is working to

785
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,559
to dramatically increase 3x the amount

786
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,880
of adaptation finance that we have

787
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,120
you also saw the u.s leading work

788
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,159
towards the announcement

789
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,919
of the g7 of a new 2 billion

790
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,840
for the accelerating coal transitions

791
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,679
program and other clean energy

792
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,200
transition programs at the climate

793
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,799
investment funds at the sifs

794
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,320
um this is meant to uh as as we

795
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,600
the g7 uh step away from uh

796
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,240
uh you know having anything to do with

797
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,000
public support for international

798
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,880
coal it's important to help countries

799
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,720
with the financial resources and

800
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,440
as as well as the technical uh you know

801
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,799
expertise um

802
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,360
and uh uh and and the uh and the

803
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,120
solutions and technologies needed

804
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
to transition away from coal in their

805
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,799
energy sectors towards cleaner energy

806
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,159
sources that by the way are going to

807
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:04,960
deliver

808
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,120
better benefits in terms of air quality

809
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,799
and oftentimes also in terms of job

810
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,440
quality

811
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,799
in many of these economies around the

812
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,640
world and

813
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,960
including many developing countries now

814
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,080
in addition to this

815
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,960
um uh we you know we also need to be

816
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,159
very focused on

817
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,080
uh addressing where the where the

818
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
largest are

819
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,360
it's not in the countries it's not in

820
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,799
small island states it's not the most

821
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,760
vulnerable

822
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,279
these are the ones that have most at

823
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,960
stake in the future of the climate

824
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,600
crisis

825
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,520
and yet they are often the ones uh the

826
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,120
lowest emissions globally

827
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,240
instead we need to focus on uh the

828
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,279
45 percent of global gdp which is not

829
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,360
aligned the largest economies which are

830
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
not aligned with keeping 1.5 degrees c

831
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,159
within reach

832
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,240
the united states europe the rest of the

833
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,960
g7 indeed the rest of the oecd

834
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,200
can do as much as it can but we're going

835
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,039
to need to help the rest of the world to

836
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,159
come along with us

837
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:57,679
together in addressing this climate

838
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,240
crisis i would like to remind

839
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,960
the audience that all of the oecd

840
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
economies and missions

841
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,200
combined are less than the emissions of

842
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,720
just china

843
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,200
china's per capita emissions are quickly

844
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,080
catching up

845
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,440
to the oecd average per capita emissions

846
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,600
and so what we it's not to call out any

847
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,679
single country but it is to say

848
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,440
that we need to also be serious about

849
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,360
where the future of energy growth is

850
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,919
where the future of emissions growth is

851
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:26,480
it's not

852
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,360
in the united states it's not in europe

853
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
it's in non-oecd asia

854
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
it's in africa it's in latin america

855
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,559
it's in central and south asia

856
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,559
this is where we have to work to bend

857
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,000
the emissions curve

858
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,840
and we have to work hand in hand with

859
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,279
these countries we have to

860
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,000
deploy clean energy goods and services

861
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
that that we have to offer

862
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,520
uh in order to help these economies bend

863
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,039
their emissions curves as quickly as

864
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:49,679
possible

865
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
and in the meantime while doing it by

866
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,760
the way to bolster their economic and

867
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,159
energy

868
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,159
security that's the only way to get

869
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,679
countries around the world to buy into

870
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:58,640
this transition

871
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,720
they have a stake in it and so on that

872
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,399
note i just like to say since we're at

873
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,000
globe sec i'd like to highlight

874
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,240
that the cee region in europe is

875
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,840
important is an important place not just

876
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
to be deploying clean energy but to

877
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,000
become an

878
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,320
engine of clean energy manufacturing in

879
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,200
fact it's already

880
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,039
the battery of europe the battery

881
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,880
capital of europe in terms of

882
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,120
uh uh building you know gigafactories

883
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,559
that are going to supply batteries for

884
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,840
the electric vehicle

885
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,760
industry of europe into the future i'd

886
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,200
like to see central and eastern europe

887
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,080
also become

888
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,039
a trusted uh source of clean energy

889
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,960
manufacturing in a full range of clean

890
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,159
energy technologies

891
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,760
that we in the united states as well as

892
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,159
our friends in europe can depend upon um

893
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,919
to to feed the the clean energy

894
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,039
deployment we're going to need in our

895
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,039
economies but also around the world

896
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,480
thank you david i want to go to the

897
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
audience now with a poll

898
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,480
we we have a poll on slido so those of

899
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
you who are on slido if you would pull

900
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,640
it up

901
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,159
we want to talk a little bit about net

902
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,039
zero so this is the first question

903
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,600
how confident are you that your country

904
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,679
will meet the goal of net zero emissions

905
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,880
by 2050

906
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,039
needed in order to limit global warming

907
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,880
to 1.5 degrees c so let's

908
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,840
see how confident folks are that their

909
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,559
country

910
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,600
their own country is doing well and

911
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,480
we'll meet the goal

912
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,399
hmm not

913
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,720
looking very confident let's get all the

914
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,960
results in

915
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,039
okay fascinating

916
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,399
no one has said very confident

917
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,440
well let's go on let me write my notes

918
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,600
here so we've got a 50

919
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,279
let's see our 47 47 and confident five

920
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,200
and very confident zero all right the

921
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,399
next question

922
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,559
how confident are you the the world the

923
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,320
world at large in other words will meet

924
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,919
the goal of net zero emissions

925
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,720
by 2050 needed to limit global warming

926
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,919
to 1.5 degrees c

927
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,000
so will the world do a better job than

928
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,840
your own country how confident are you

929
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,120
let's see do we have the results of the

930
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,120
second poll yet i'm curious

931
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,559
okay wow

932
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,240
not a very optimistic group

933
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,799
so um and i'm not sure um if my

934
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,679
panelists can see these results

935
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,159
but what we are seeing okay you can see

936
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,519
these um

937
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,799
wow well let me take this now to you

938
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,960
jennifer uh there doesn't look like

939
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,039
there's a lot of optimism

940
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:40,399
out there um you know what what what

941
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,840
does this say to you

942
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,600
well i think partially i it depends on

943
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,120
who the audience is

944
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,799
um i think that i see

945
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,200
more skepticism i would say in corporate

946
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,039
and government circles than i do in

947
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,480
other circles

948
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,840
um because i see quite a lot of wanting

949
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,240
to hang on to the status quo

950
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,720
uh of where things are and if and and

951
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
we've seen that happen

952
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
very big fights for it for all for the

953
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,559
recovery funds that have happened to

954
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,159
hold on to

955
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,039
uh the fossil fuel economy as we have it

956
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:17,760
so

957
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,600
that's one question i would ask because

958
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
i think uh where i get my optimism from

959
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,200
is not from government or corporate

960
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,519
leaders it's actually from youth

961
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,120
it's from uh people who are on the

962
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
ground really trying to

963
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,919
move to um to create a better world

964
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,360
that's one reflection

965
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,279
the second is that i think that there is

966
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,399
still this myth

967
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:39,519
that there's a dichotomy between

968
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,240
having a prosperous economic

969
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,320
you know well-being for people and

970
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,600
taking care of the environment at the

971
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,320
same time

972
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,279
and i think that we we need to

973
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,080
understand

974
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,240
that those things come together i think

975
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,519
if anybody needs to

976
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,039
hear an answer to that you just need to

977
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,720
hear this listen to president biden say

978
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,480
climate change changes jobs

979
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,720
right and if you want to look at where

980
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,039
uh countries that are moving forward

981
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,519
and trying to bring these different

982
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,800
crises together

983
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,119
you see that climate is at that center

984
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,719
but i think oftentimes

985
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,800
you still see either misinformation

986
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
coming forward on that or fear-mongering

987
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
on that but actually they belong very

988
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,280
much together

989
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,879
and i wonder if that might be behind

990
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,040
those numbers as well

991
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,960
we got a really interesting question on

992
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,679
slido and i'd like to share it

993
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,560
and our slido viewer says are we seeing

994
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,760
political interest

995
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,760
in cooperating with china on climate

996
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,879
issues is there

997
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,040
a complementary agenda on both sides

998
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,000
do you have any thoughts on that

999
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,639
um i well as uh

1000
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,280
david said we don't have the choice no

1001
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,839
we we need to cooperate with china to

1002
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,159
because if not the climate crisis cannot

1003
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,839
be solved

1004
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,400
the older issue is about um

1005
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,480
so different options when we discuss

1006
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,680
cooperation in china

1007
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,280
while in chinese

1008
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,160
on many other sectors whether human

1009
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,920
rights or trade or

1010
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,200
and or military whatever so of course in

1011
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,560
classical geopolitics

1012
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,119
no and this is playing a role of course

1013
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,200
but on the other side

1014
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
you know there are different movement

1015
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,720
when you look at the

1016
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,839
chinese society and even the chinese

1017
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,920
leadership

1018
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,560
i see that and and probably because of

1019
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,599
the

1020
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,119
new u.s administration a discussion

1021
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,320
in china that was not existing

1022
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,160
even two years ago uh and which were

1023
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,480
zero carbon and really the

1024
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,839
transformation the

1025
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,839
even the discussion about what we do

1026
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,160
with the pipeline of coal power plants

1027
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,480
is open where i can i can tell you it

1028
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,160
was not open two years ago

1029
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,720
so there is a positive effect of the

1030
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,599
global scene

1031
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:04,960
on china internal discussion where

1032
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,359
you know whether the genuine national

1033
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,640
interest on the environment because

1034
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,400
cities are chinese citizens want a

1035
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,160
cleaner hair for example

1036
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,640
is gaining grounds that were from the

1037
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,800
policy makers perspective not

1038
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,079
not not an issue it was even a taboo

1039
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,520
subject sometimes

1040
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,880
so i think this is open now and i don't

1041
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,280
think

1042
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,760
we will see uh so so we have a window of

1043
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,119
opportunity

1044
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,280
how to deal with that i believe we have

1045
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,079
to in a way consider the climate crisis

1046
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,480
and the solution on many fronts

1047
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,079
that's why uh in a way pressure from

1048
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,000
an action from the business from the

1049
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,599
local authorities

1050
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,320
is important to say that finally and and

1051
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,680
in if i can say

1052
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
something i believe so much and i very

1053
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,359
happy to see

1054
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,760
the biden administration in believing

1055
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,960
that that

1056
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,000
if eu and u.s converge in many of their

1057
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,920
decision on their economies

1058
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,920
then the global market will respond to

1059
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,240
that and that will in a way be the best

1060
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,480
incentive for china to join

1061
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,880
forces and to decarbonize the economy

1062
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,000
just to get

1063
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,320
the trade still open and to recognize

1064
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,720
that the demand in united states and you

1065
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,680
and europe

1066
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,640
will be in that direction like and they

1067
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,240
they feel of course a signal and they

1068
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,400
look at them so i think

1069
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,480
maybe it's a practical cooperation and

1070
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,160
of course a traditional

1071
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
in a way discussion between government

1072
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,599
has to continue

1073
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,720
but we need a vivid discussion between

1074
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,359
companies between local authorities and

1075
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,760
as much as possible between citizens

1076
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,720
that it is a common cause it's not it

1077
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,880
should not be a polarized issues where

1078
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,359
geopolitical interests are dominating

1079
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,000
because that

1080
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,359
we can't we can't find if a solution

1081
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,079
the zero-sum game which is classical of

1082
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,160
course in power politics

1083
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,359
cannot be cannot be for practical reason

1084
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,520
the response to climate crisis and

1085
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,040
that's the same for the vaccine by the

1086
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,680
way huh

1087
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,720
so you cannot have nationalism if you

1088
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,640
want to solve the vaccine crisis and the

1089
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,920
covet crisis

1090
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,000
but you can't solve the climate crisis

1091
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,320
if you bet on nationalism so

1092
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,720
giving the right signal having a very

1093
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,760
united

1094
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,880
europe and united states in the sense we

1095
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,960
give to the evolution of the economy and

1096
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,079
societies

1097
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,480
i think it's a it's a quite safe way in

1098
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
my view and you see that

1099
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,520
i don't want to be too long you see that

1100
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,079
the impact on the resolve of the

1101
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,560
united states and europe on the

1102
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,040
investment in coal where you see china

1103
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,800
reconsidering and many countries

1104
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,760
reconsidering even in this region

1105
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,000
and globsec is such an important

1106
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,280
platform for that

1107
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,480
you see now countries that finally

1108
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,920
withdraw from big coal power plants

1109
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,200
when they have a discussion on

1110
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,359
investments with china and turn to other

1111
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,280
solutions you have seen greece serbia

1112
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,720
and many others

1113
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,960
and that final china can respond into

1114
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,480
offering other seats

1115
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,760
and including renewable energy uh so

1116
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,720
i i do think that there is a space there

1117
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,640
i'd love to go to um a question in the

1118
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,480
room we do have our live audience and if

1119
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,400
we have any more questions on slido

1120
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,240
so does anyone have a question if you

1121
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,480
would come to the microphone

1122
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,800
or else i have one actually david i'm

1123
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,000
going to go ahead and ask you this

1124
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,960
because

1125
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,680
there was a judge in louisiana who made

1126
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,320
a ruling

1127
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,720
earlier this week which is a setback

1128
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,040
obviously for the biden administration

1129
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,440
which had suspended new oil and gas

1130
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
leases on federal lands and waters and

1131
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,800
the judge said

1132
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,000
that the president doesn't have the

1133
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,160
power to do that that that's congress's

1134
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,720
power

1135
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,240
since it was the branch that originally

1136
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,079
made federal lands and waters eligible

1137
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,839
for leasing is so to be too much of a

1138
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,320
hardship on uh on the states that we're

1139
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,040
trying to exploit the oil and gas

1140
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,680
how do you you know push forward this

1141
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,640
global goal

1142
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,839
when you're getting so much push back at

1143
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,839
home

1144
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,079
kathleen i'm not familiar with that

1145
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
individual case i'd have to go back and

1146
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,800
look at it

1147
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,520
in any case it's not exactly in in my

1148
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,200
specific portfolio but what i will say

1149
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,680
is the

1150
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
the you know the us's climate target

1151
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,880
including the 2030

1152
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,280
uh new enhanced climate target that sets

1153
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,000
a goal of reducing emissions 50 to 50

1154
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,280
percent uh by 2030 was a result of a

1155
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,480
very extensive

1156
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,960
uh consultation across the u.s

1157
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
interagency across the us government

1158
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,920
with external stakeholders and it looked

1159
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,839
at a wide variety of different scenarios

1160
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:30,960
for implementation

1161
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,599
knowing that we have a very unique and

1162
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,280
complex system of governance in the

1163
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,359
united states a multi-layered

1164
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,520
uh federalist system that was you know

1165
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,760
has been envisioned for certain reasons

1166
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,240
and is

1167
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,040
as as strengths weaknesses but has base

1168
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,640
proved itself to be durable

1169
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,480
and to actually be able to achieve big

1170
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,680
things over

1171
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,160
you know the decades and the centuries

1172
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,359
now a big part of that is

1173
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,000
is indeed the fact that uh congress is

1174
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,480
critical

1175
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,720
for advancing uh climate clean energy

1176
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,400
goals but so are states

1177
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,920
so our cities or various other

1178
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,440
localities one of the

1179
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,599
silver linings of the past several years

1180
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,440
in which a different administration was

1181
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,040
perhaps not quite

1182
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,800
at the table on climate change and in

1183
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,000
the leadership position like this

1184
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,280
administration is

1185
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,440
is the fact that you had a network of

1186
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,720
different non-federal government actors

1187
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,319
governors mayors university presidents

1188
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:25,520
labor leaders uh corporate ceos all

1189
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,520
coming together to send the signal that

1190
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,800
they were still committed to the paris

1191
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,599
agreement

1192
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,200
and that they were going to chart out a

1193
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,520
course to try and achieve

1194
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,119
you know what is necessary to reach net

1195
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:37,520
zero by 2050 regardless of what happens

1196
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,040
in washington dc

1197
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,560
now that's a really powerful

1198
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,720
architecture that we need to build on

1199
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,880
we have sub-national champions at every

1200
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,560
different level regardless of what

1201
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,200
happens in

1202
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,680
any one individual court case we have a

1203
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,359
much stronger architecture

1204
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,160
of sub-national action as well as civil

1205
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,760
society and corporate action

1206
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,920
than we ever had even four or five years

1207
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,839
ago so we need to build on that we need

1208
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,880
to work with it

1209
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,480
we need to not just harness it but also

1210
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,800
empower it to go out and go perhaps even

1211
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,319
further than the federal government many

1212
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,440
different ways

1213
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,119
even as this administration the biden

1214
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,800
harris administration sets out the most

1215
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,599
ambitious

1216
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,599
climate platform domestically and

1217
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,200
internationally that's ever existed in

1218
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,720
the united states

1219
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
and so you know when that happens also

1220
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,760
we see it happening

1221
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,839
according to local economic logic we see

1222
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,200
those that see an opportunity in

1223
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,079
manufacturing

1224
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,240
electric buses down in south carolina

1225
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,599
going ahead and embracing that

1226
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:28,560
opportunity

1227
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,280
we see those that want to play a role in

1228
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,640
providing the steel

1229
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,599
uh and the turbines for offshore wind at

1230
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,160
let's say

1231
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,839
you know revitalize shipyards and

1232
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,480
foundries in the gulf coast to louisiana

1233
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,240
at facilities in west virginia and

1234
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,839
elsewhere across the united states

1235
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,599
leaning into that opportunity

1236
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,440
so coastal states remember aren't the

1237
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
only ones that have a lot to gain from

1238
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
the 30 gigawatts of offshore wind

1239
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,599
by 2030 goal that president biden set

1240
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,160
and so

1241
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,920
you know if we empower and unleash those

1242
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,119
different communities those different

1243
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,000
actors

1244
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,079
you know outside of government and at

1245
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,280
different levels of government in the

1246
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,160
united states

1247
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,280
i do think that we're still going to

1248
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,200
make significant progress towards the

1249
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,480
shared goals that we have

1250
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
even as we work with congress to you

1251
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,680
know um

1252
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,440
to reach those targets and to do it

1253
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,000
first and foremost by making investments

1254
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,720
uh first and foremost in the communities

1255
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,160
and in the technologies and in the

1256
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,520
opportunities we need to

1257
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,800
because that will start to create the

1258
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,960
virtuous cycle of political economy

1259
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
that we can then build on we got to get

1260
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,560
that momentum first and we have to make

1261
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,680
those investments

1262
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,160
uh at home and you know in various

1263
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,440
different communities across the united

1264
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,960
states

1265
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,200
um jennifer um i'm going to give you

1266
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,160
just a moment

1267
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,440
to sort of give us your final thoughts

1268
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,200
because we're down to two and a half

1269
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,040
minutes what is it

1270
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,319
that must the key to success do you

1271
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:46,800
think

1272
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,920
at cop26 if there's one two things

1273
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,640
that you can cite

1274
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:54,880
i think the first thing is that the uk

1275
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
presidency prioritizes

1276
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,280
uh outreach and engagement with

1277
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,880
developing countries

1278
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,880
and works to make sure that the the

1279
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,079
trust is built there

1280
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,040
works to ensure that uh there's vaccine

1281
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,160
equity that

1282
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,400
debt is is cancelled and that there's a

1283
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,160
climate finance package there i think

1284
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,240
they are on the front line

1285
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,200
uh so that is one key thing and the

1286
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,599
second

1287
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,440
i would just say is that the governments

1288
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,119
as a whole listen to people rather than

1289
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,319
the corporations

1290
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,560
we haven't talked as much about that but

1291
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,240
there are efforts right now under why i

1292
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,079
buy companies to set

1293
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,480
uh net zero goals there's good net zero

1294
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,160
goals and there's not so good net zero

1295
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,520
goals and so i think it will be

1296
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,280
fundamental to make sure

1297
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,839
that uh the companies that show up in

1298
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,599
paris are really part of the solution

1299
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,119
and they're not using

1300
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,920
false solutions like offsets uh to try

1301
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,040
and delay action

1302
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,240
and uh that that is a key piece because

1303
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,319
it will empower governments also

1304
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,960
to be uh taking that type of uh

1305
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,240
increased ambition

1306
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,560
moving forward in this kind of job

1307
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,599
creating

1308
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,440
um different system for the future for

1309
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,760
and the signal that can be sent uh that

1310
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,040
they're really serious and will get

1311
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:05,839
close

1312
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,720
keep that 1.5 degree goal in sight

1313
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,280
