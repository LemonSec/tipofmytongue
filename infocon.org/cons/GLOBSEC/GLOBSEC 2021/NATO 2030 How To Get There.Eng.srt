that has been laid out for you

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,000

of the nato summit earlier this year or

63
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,640
been a big week

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,560
in brussels been a big week in europe

65
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200
with the u.s eu summit but also the nato

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:03,920
summit

67
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,879
on june 14th so what is your view from

68
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
brussels ambassador braja and

69
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,360
how did the vision of nato 2030

70
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,640
specifically

71
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,640
factor into the summit outcomes from

72
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,360
earlier this week

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,199
thank you very much globesick for

74
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,720
inviting me and it's

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
it's great to be back even though this

76
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,560
time virtually in bratislava and next

77
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,600
time in person

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,320
promise the nato summit was indeed the

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,240
decision-making summit it was not just

80
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,080
the summit of managing differences

81
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,520
or or getting us together so the 30

82
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,120
leaders made an important package of

83
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,840
decisions

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
uh on nato 2030 initiative which is to

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:40,880
adopt

86
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
alliance for the future and when we

87
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,080
think back

88
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,440
the nato is indeed the adaptation

89
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,160
uh in in person uh when we remember 4849

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,919
when the alliance was established the

91
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,360
external

92
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,520
enemy was actually germany that was

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,800
considered at the time

94
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,280
so look at where we are now and we are

95
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
preparing for the future

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,320
indeed the the most important uh uh

97
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,759
sort of guiding principle framing

98
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,080
principle is that see allies recognize

99
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,320
that we are in the era of systemic

100
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,759
competition

101
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,520
and that requires a number of practical

102
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
practical steps so first to strengthen

103
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
international rules-based

104
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,479
order so work with partners like-minded

105
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,639
countries organizations to make sure

106
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,759
that what we agree

107
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
at internationally is actually observed

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,520
so and

109
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,639
nato has its role to play it's a

110
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,280
regional

111
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,440
political military alliance but of

112
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,919
course we have global partners

113
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,759
and we have values that we've been

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
founded upon so

115
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,960
its protection of our democracy is one

116
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
billion uh citizens

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,360
in the modern era so for that we need to

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,320
strengthen of course

119
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,120
defense and deterrence to have see the

120
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
adaptation also there

121
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,479
which means also not only the uh

122
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,600
hard power and and the hard capabilities

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,759
uh that that our militaries need but

124
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,400
also the resilience of all societies

125
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,960
including private sector including civil

126
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,199
societies including every citizen

127
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,319
but also of course adoption of the

128
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,479
emerging and disruptive technologies to

129
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,160
ensure that our

130
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
strong military and strong political

131
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,880
unity has the necessary technological

132
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,440
edge

133
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,080
to be able to work among themselves to

134
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,560
be

135
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,840
interoperable but also to be able to

136
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,560
resist

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,360
to all external threats whatever and

138
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,000
wherever they

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
come from and again for political unity

140
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,319
meaning the agility of understanding

141
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,240
what is happening externally what we

142
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
need to do internally

143
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,919
the consultations among the allies and

144
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,840
consultations with the closest partners

145
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,479
on

146
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,520
all issues of relevance and finally

147
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,560
again for the partners the enhanced

148
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
package for training

149
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,479
and not only training you know as as one

150
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,520
way but

151
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
the exchange the understanding and and

152
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
the real capability building

153
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,160
for them to address those challenges and

154
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,880
threats that

155
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,280
they require thank you so much

156
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
ambassador before we uh turn it over to

157
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,319
katrina mulligan

158
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,680
i'd like to take a look at the word

159
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,280
cloud one more time before before we

160
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,880
move on

161
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,479
so this is really interesting i don't

162
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,400
know that just a few years ago you would

163
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,039
have seen

164
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,680
china as a top answer here when we're

165
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,199
asking what the primary challenge

166
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,120
facing nato will be in the next 10 years

167
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,199
but it tees us up really nicely for our

168
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,560
next question and katrina i'm going to

169
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
go ahead and turn it to you

170
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,560
so there are three words that we hear a

171
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,440
lot of the time

172
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,039
when we are talking about today's

173
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,039
strategic landscape and those three

174
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,520
words

175
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,759
are great power competition and that

176
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,759
means nato doesn't have just one

177
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,759
strategic competitor around which all of

178
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
the allies can coalesce it means we now

179
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,080
have

180
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,560
two near-peer competitors both of which

181
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,120
for whom nato must have a strategy

182
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
so katrina turning it over to you and

183
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,120
ambassador hoisin i i'd ask you to to

184
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,680
jump on

185
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,639
jump in on this as well if you'd like

186
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,080
can nato

187
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,400
handle both russia and china and and

188
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
does it have the ability to do both at

189
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,800
the same time and should it well

190
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,759
i certainly hope so i certainly expect

191
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,639
them to

192
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,680
um you know china and russia pose very

193
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,240
different

194
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
challenges um for nato and and allied

195
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,240
countries

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
the the chinese communist party is

197
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,639
actively attempting to shape

198
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,960
the rules and norms of the international

199
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,840
system

200
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,760
and they're taking an increased

201
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,120
leadership role um

202
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,399
or they're trying to within the

203
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,719
international order the russian

204
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,679
government

205
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,039
is is more belligerent they are breaking

206
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,560
rather than shaping global norms and so

207
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,959
you really need to think about them both

208
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,640
um as authoritarian

209
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,880
uh countries that need to be tackled

210
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,560
together but but also

211
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
look at the individual um

212
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,000
goals and norms that they're trying to

213
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
shape and break

214
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
um and and tailor policy responses

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,120
accordingly

216
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,760
um on china i really think that nato

217
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,680
should recognize china as a clear threat

218
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,480
to the alliance

219
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
based on the word cloud it seems like uh

220
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,519
we're already

221
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,560
there or near there um

222
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
but that threat is both in the short

223
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,640
term but but much more so in the longer

224
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,360
term

225
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,279
um that we need to build resilience

226
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,800
short critical weaknesses

227
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
um among the allies particularly in

228
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
technology

229
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
uh and and other areas that the

230
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,080
chinese communist party can exploit on

231
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,800
russia

232
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,560
it's a bit of a different approach the

233
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,600
costs need to be clear and imposed

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,519
uh for its belligerent behavior and

235
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
gross violations of international law

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
um but one of the unique

237
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,680
attributes that we need to take into

238
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
account as we're formulating policy in

239
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
this area is that the china-russia

240
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,560
relationship

241
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
has really grown in recent years

242
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
including in diplomacy and defense

243
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
in economics and russia's strategic

244
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,160
reval

245
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
re-evaluation of its relationship with

246
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,440
china

247
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,279
resulted in part from the fallout with

248
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,279
the west as a result of its annexation

249
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,519
of crimea in 2014

250
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,680
and so what we're starting to see is

251
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
enhanced military cooperation

252
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
and shared political values that have

253
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
really driven the countries closer

254
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
beijing and moscow largely agree on the

255
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,600
role

256
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
of the sovereignty of the state of human

257
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,800
rights and the principle of

258
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,079
non-interference

259
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,320
um and those similarities are aiding in

260
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
their cooperation but there are

261
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,519
deep economic structural barriers that

262
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,760
stand in the way of further cooperation

263
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,680
and inner integration between these two

264
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,040
powers um

265
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,880
and russia is going to remain the junior

266
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,399
partner in that relationship

267
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,959
which is a position it doesn't relish

268
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,040
and so there are some real opportunities

269
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,440
i think for nato and allied countries

270
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
to unite around a strategy that would

271
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,200
at the strategic level recognize and

272
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,160
counter

273
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,240
beijing and moscow's efforts to fragment

274
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
the alliance

275
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,600
um and show and view them as

276
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,959
coordinating their efforts

277
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,839
um to challenge the global governance

278
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,279
system and curb u.s and western power

279
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,000
by considering them together but also as

280
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,279
individual challenges

281
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,279
i think the focus really ought to be on

282
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,560
china um

283
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,640
china is much more interested in russia

284
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,560
in having a stable working relationship

285
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,760
with the united states

286
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,399
albeit on china's terms and the us is

287
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,880
going to need to work better um

288
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,760
to understand the local dynamics within

289
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,519
the borders of its allies and partners

290
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,040
as they as they work through

291
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
um the china challenge um and then you

292
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,320
know

293
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
with with russia it's going to be really

294
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
curbing their

295
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,959
aggressive behavior yep

296
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,399
thank you katrina ambassador hoisin

297
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,160
would you like to jump in on the china

298
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
and russia challenge when it comes to

299
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
nato

300
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
yes happy happy to do so and then i

301
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,360
truly what katrina just said now

302
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
you you i don't know it was a mistake or

303
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,040
not you didn't invite the german nato

304
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,639
ambassador but you invited the german

305
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,240
u.n ambassador so

306
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,440
i'm not the nato specialist but i

307
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,959
see how this relationship with

308
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,079
china and russia plays out here here in

309
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:16,639
new york

310
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,079
and i can only subscribe to what

311
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,440
katrina said before we see

312
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,839
a very close cooperation between russia

313
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,040
and china

314
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,480
um and um within the security council

315
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,399
where he was a member of the last couple

316
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,160
of years um

317
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,839
you couldn't you couldn't you know when

318
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,160
it came to voting

319
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,760
they never parted from each other but

320
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
they have a different approach

321
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,800
russia is much more aggressive much more

322
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,720
belligerent that katrina said they

323
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,079
don't actually care about

324
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,680
being in a minority um and getting you

325
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,959
know

326
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,000
voted against them in large margins

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
china is much more subtle china is

328
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,839
actually trying to

329
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,120
reshape the

330
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,079
basis of the multilateral order and this

331
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:10,480
is

332
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,800
what i see as a as something very

333
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,480
dangerous and

334
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,399
this is you know when you look at the

335
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,320
basis of the un

336
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,959
this is a rules-based order this is a

337
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,000
order where

338
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,320
um individual human rights play an

339
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,480
important control versus declaration of

340
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,639
human rights is a basis of the internet

341
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,920
community and

342
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,639
china has a new narrative um not that

343
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,120
new but

344
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,399
china has a narrative that um the

345
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,399
the most important is the state the

346
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,600
society

347
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,240
and the national sovereignty and what

348
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
countries do within

349
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,560
their borders is up to them there is

350
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
nothing from the outside that

351
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,040
you you um intervene so this that you

352
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,199
intervene so we have it of course the

353
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,199
the case the most prominent is about the

354
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,279
uyghurs where we say you know this is

355
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,079
something

356
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,120
we have to engage and we have to protect

357
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,079
the individuals

358
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,560
you know one million people in detention

359
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,320
camps china says no this is none of your

360
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
business

361
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
um you know we have brought 300 million

362
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,959
chinese into

363
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,560
um into wealth and well-being and the 1

364
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
million have to pay price for this and

365
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,839
this is unacceptable we have to fight

366
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,279
for it we have to see

367
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,600
that the values that we stand for that

368
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,680
we stood for there was a basis for nato

369
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,560
for the u.n

370
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,399
that this continues to to work and

371
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,680
to come back um also do it

372
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
of course russia are much more

373
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,399
aggressive they invade ukraine they

374
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,880
undercut the chemical weapons convention

375
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,519
in

376
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,720
um in in syria they bomb hospitals china

377
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,199
is much

378
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,320
more more subtle um but

379
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,199
as as dangerous as as i said um

380
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,040
undercutting the values and this is

381
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,639
where we have to stand together

382
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,920
um nato has to stand together but um

383
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,279
with the eu have to have a a global

384
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,000
um a global community where we defend

385
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,320
our

386
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,600
our values and this is something that

387
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
has to be done at the u.n

388
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
but of course something where nato has

389
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,639
to be strong and

390
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,959
one more point for nato of course the

391
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:13,920
classical

392
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
defense we have to be ready um you know

393
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,000
for situations where

394
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,360
you have the the the aggressor um

395
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,240
trying to invade but um the much more

396
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
important i think is

397
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,800
at this stage the the hybrid warfare

398
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,639
what we saw here in the us right now

399
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,480
with this big pipeline or what we have

400
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,120
seen

401
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
starting in the early or the mid 2000s

402
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,160
with the

403
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,800
um with the cyber do you remember the

404
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
bronze soldier etc

405
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,279
um and what we see now in in in on a

406
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,240
very broad

407
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,680
range um attacks against parliaments um

408
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,440
oh the the also the the disinformation

409
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,959
campaign and all this this is

410
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,440
much broader and this is what nato has

411
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
to has to cope with

412
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,759
thank you and i failed to mention at the

413
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,959
beginning that if you have

414
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,040
questions you can type them onto the

415
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,000
slido app

416
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
and i i also mentioned that we only had

417
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,279
about 20 minutes so i can't promise that

418
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,160
we'll get to them

419
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,759
uh but if you if you have any please

420
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,680
please send them over and i'll try

421
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,639
um i'd like to pick up on something that

422
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,000
you said ambassador huyskin

423
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,839
to one element in the in yeah

424
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
you know nato is a as i said regional

425
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,440
organization it doesn't mean that nato

426
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,600
will conduct operations you know in

427
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,480
in the pacific uh even though china is

428
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,360
very clearly

429
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,120
uh reflected there is a new strong

430
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,040
language in in the communique

431
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,320
however again see today's threats are

432
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,759
completely different

433
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,959
they affect nato's nations nato citizens

434
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:45,920
our citizens

435
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,839
and of course it's our interest to be

436
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,920
united this transatlantic celebration of

437
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
unities that we had on the 14th of june

438
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,079
with president biden and with allies

439
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,040
completely united around these these

440
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,880
understanding of these new threats

441
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
in the same time of course also with

442
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,959
china china is rapidly expanding its

443
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,400
nuclear arsenal

444
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,319
its values is not in accordance with

445
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,160
washington treaty

446
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,640
it's its coercive behaviors ambassador

447
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,720
hoisgen said with its uh towards its own

448
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,400
population but also not only

449
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,160
not only towards its own also to other

450
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,520
countries

451
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,919
it all together as a package is is

452
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,880
something that was not there even in

453
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,119
2019

454
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,359
and you you would have seen in in london

455
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,359
communique that language was

456
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,360
quite different having said that of

457
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,280
course as with all countries also with

458
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,760
russia china nato is ready to talk

459
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,600
the dialogue is an important part of who

460
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,120
we are and

461
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
uh in that respect also with china china

462
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,880
has to be part of the solution on the

463
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,320
climate change

464
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,720
combat again we are serious about it and

465
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,080
also on quite a number of other

466
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,120
other issues so again we do

467
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,880
recognize it's a it's a challenge the

468
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
situation has changed it's systemic

469
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,000
competition but in the same times the

470
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,679
dialogue has to be there and we are open

471
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,039
for it

472
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,880
thank you i'd like to follow up on on

473
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
something that ambassador hoist

474
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,840
hoisin mentioned and and you have

475
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,679
mentioned as well um

476
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,960
uh resilience it's an important topic

477
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,520
at nato especially as the alliance deals

478
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,720
increasingly

479
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,400
with these sub-article five level

480
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,919
threats

481
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,240
we've seen you know in september this

482
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,320
year uh the united states will mark one

483
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,760
of the greatest black swan events in our

484
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,600
history september 11th we're just

485
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,960
also coming out of the throes of a

486
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
global pandemic so how is nato thinking

487
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,840
about

488
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,080
black swan events and and do you think

489
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,200
there's anything that nato has

490
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,559
overlooked when thinking about them

491
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,320
ambassador raja i'll come to you

492
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,000
uh and can treat katrina and ambassador

493
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,440
hoisin if you'd like to jump in as well

494
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,600
on that

495
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,760
yeah thanks very much for this for this

496
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,360
important question that's what nato is

497
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,320
basically

498
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,120
about we are that's why we are investing

499
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,360
in

500
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,039
in uh adaptation and and forecasting the

501
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,799
future and scenarios

502
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
our exercises our whole planning is very

503
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,600
much around it

504
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
and i'm pleased to say that actually the

505
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,280
investment has paid back

506
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
and and uh again there are issues i

507
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,320
can't talk about very openly here in an

508
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,280
open format

509
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
but certainly awareness agility and

510
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,600
ability to respond

511
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,240
for nato is there on cyber obviously

512
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,000
it's more with the nations themselves

513
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,919
even though nato has clearly said that

514
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,760
cyber's operational domain it's played

515
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,280
out in all exercises clearly

516
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,320
understanding that

517
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,160
there's not going to be just a military

518
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,559
type of operation only it will always

519
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,559
come together with all the hybrids

520
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,320
and and in that respect also with cyber

521
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,200
the nations have shown that they can

522
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,240
respond

523
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
uh with very concrete measures so the

524
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,760
discussion currently is actually on

525
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,960
response measures and

526
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,520
and uh how to proceed that and again

527
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,559
that's for the

528
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,320
very much around the 30 allies where we

529
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,960
are now thank you ambassador hoiskin to

530
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,320
you and katrina we have about

531
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,520
two or three minutes left

532
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,400
what is very important is that um yes

533
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,000
we have to look at all the challenges um

534
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,320
that we face with the hybrid dwarf

535
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,080
prayer with disinformation campaigns et

536
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,679
cetera we have to do that

537
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,600
on a national level nations are

538
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
asked to fight it but i think nato can

539
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
do a lot by

540
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,799
coordinating by

541
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,559
together um these are attacks um where

542
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,440
we are all confronted with and and nato

543
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,720
is best placed to

544
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
to to really cooperate and see that we

545
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,480
are we are

546
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,880
resilient these are many questions um

547
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,840
this is from

548
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,880
you know energy um transportation

549
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,080
um food and water resources

550
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,360
and um communication systems

551
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
there are a lot of things and we just

552
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
also have to raise awareness in

553
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,919
in our population and this cannot be

554
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,120
done by

555
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,919
governments alone civil society and

556
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:58,960
private sector have

557
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,240
all to work to work together thank you

558
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,600
katrina we're right out of time so

559
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
briefly thank you

560
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,480
the only thing i would add is that you

561
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
know as we look over the horizon we need

562
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
to be paying attention to the

563
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,760
investments that the chinese are making

564
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,080
in

565
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,400
european infrastructure which include

566
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,919
things like shipping terminals and

567
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,600
utilities and telecom

568
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,480
networks um you know going forward

569
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,919
looking into the future one of the

570
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,200
things that china's going to have the

571
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,720
ability to do

572
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,559
is potentially weaponize those

573
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:29,760
investments

574
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,400
in order to frustrate limit or prevent

575
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,919
the us or allied

576
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,240
use of that infrastructure which could

577
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,159
cause its own black swan event in the

578
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
future

579
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,400
perfect that's a great note to end on

580
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,320
this was an excellent scene setter we

581
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,679

so before i introduce our esteemed panel

606
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,240
i would like to put that last question

607
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,480
that the last panel dealt with to the

608
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,440

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,840
that you think nato will have to deal

614
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,559
with

615
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,320

turkey blocking nato decision making we

had that long conversation behind closed

638
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,240
doors with turkey on monday which

639
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,799
might have been a little bit of that uh

640
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,480
climate migration

641
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,919
um as uh one of the panelists has said

642
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:24,799
in the last three days

643
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,559
of discussion we could see up to 150

644
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,520
million people

645
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,320
on the move due to instability from the

646
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080
climate change

647
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,760
artificial intelligence um if if

648
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,039
anyone saw war games

649
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,400
we also have again climate change so

650
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,559
that's a good jumping off point i'd like

651
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,440
to now turn

652
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,279

uh minister nadia so what do you think

655
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,880

656
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,559
parliament just um

657
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,720

658
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
security strategy

659
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
is there anything in there that is

660
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,679
looking ahead to

661
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,360
um what what you're seeing in your

662
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,279
crystal ball

663
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,200
thank you very much uh first of all let

664
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,640
me start with the expression my

665
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,360
gratitude to my friends from klopsek for

666
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
outstanding conference again this year

667
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
and uh you know honestly saying

668
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
i used to work for them and uh i need to

669
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,720
say that i believe that it was the the

670
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,679
most uh

671
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,279
difficult and tough job that i have ever

672
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,320
had to work alongside robert and milan

673
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,559
until the moment tonight when i became

674
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,840
the defense minister and i said okay

675
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,120
this is more difficult but

676
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,720
yesterday as you can see on my face uh i

677
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,080
learned the lesson that even playing

678
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,600
soccer might be very difficult so

679
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,440
nevertheless uh congress guys for

680
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
excellent job this year again thank you

681
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,960
yes uh honestly uh it's difficult to

682
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,720
have a crystal ball but we try to

683
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,840
to find a reflection of current world

684
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,640
together with ivan korchok my my uh very

685
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,080
close friend and colleague minister of

686
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,320
foreign affairs and we try to

687
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,120
to write two documents uh security and

688
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,039
then defense strategies uh

689
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,480
we renewed these documents actually

690
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,320
after 15 years

691
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
and uh i believe that we were uh

692
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,400
successful enough in order to to reflect

693
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,159
the the current reality

694
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,600
uh yes there are some issues that are uh

695
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,520
closer to us or we we consider it to be

696
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,320
a more difficult uh challenges that are

697
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,440
in front of us

698
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,279
including obviously situation with

699
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,960
russia including uh

700
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,360
cyber security and then there are issues

701
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,360
that we believe to be very important

702
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,400
uh but uh still you know you have some

703
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
priorities but you know things like

704
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
climate change uh things like uh

705
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,679
uh situation in arctics uh see things

706
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:46,799
like uh

707
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,480
uh ecology and uh impacts of arm forces

708
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,799
on ecology uh this is something that we

709
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,279
certainly have to bear in mind and we

710
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,039
need to be focused so we must be focused

711
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:57,679
uh

712
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,720
on even though uh still

713
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
you do priorities and and you do uh what

714
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,400
uh

715
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,760
you you can you what you can pay for

716
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,200
on what your money would you have money

717
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,679
and also uh

718
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,279
what the political situation uh uh

719
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,760
wants from you and they taking this into

720
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,960
account i can say that

721
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,679
yes uh security strategies that we have

722
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,080
uh

723
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,840
together with the money that we spend on

724
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,159
defense is something that uh that might

725
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,840
be uh useful and help us

726
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,679
but if you have uh strategies and you

727
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,679
don't have money i think somebody at

728
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,200
nato summit said that you know if you

729
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,120
have strategies and you don't have money

730
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,520
then it's a hallucination it's not uh

731
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,240
something that

732
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,799
uh that you can do and uh none of us i

733
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,360
believe

734
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,760
uh none of three of us would like to

735
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,640
would like to

736
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,039
do hello senators we would like to do a

737
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,000
real work and i believe

738
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,559
that uh even after this summit in in

739
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,600
brussels uh

740
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,279
we have a we have a path we want to

741
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,279
follow and i think we can manage

742
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,919
so just to put to read between the lines

743
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,919
and kind of put words in your mouth

744
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,919
you're saying that russia is the most

745
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,399
likely origin of the next black swan

746
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,200
and i assume you mean something along

747
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,559
the lines of crimea

748
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,200
not just stopping a plane in the middle

749
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,240
of

750
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,480
european airspace obviously it's not

751
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
only about crimea and it's not not only

752
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,159
about the eastern uh or southeastern

753
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,600
part of ukraine but it's also about

754
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,679
reality that we live in every day

755
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,520
here on our soil here in slovakia you

756
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,120
know having uh

757
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,240
hybrid operations very active uh

758
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,720
including cyber uh area but including

759
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,399
also intelligence services being

760
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,360
deployed

761
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,880
uh including uh uh

762
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,159
obviously misuse of of media uh

763
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,880
propaganda fake news you know these

764
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,039
things we focus on and uh

765
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,720
honestly saying and i'm very friendly

766
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,960
and open here especially here on globsex

767
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,600
oil

768
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,200
uh people here in slovakia know very

769
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,039
well that uh we have decided to

770
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,000
send uh six russian uh intelligence

771
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,080
officers with the uh uh

772
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,720
with the cover of diplomats uh back home

773
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,200
from slovakia over the last 12 months uh

774
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
you know this is reality we live in and

775
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,240
uh

776
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
and this government for sure in slovakia

777
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,679
is very focused on

778
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,840
uh showing to everyone that this is not

779
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,720
a playground

780
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,000
thank you i'd like to go next to

781
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
the north macedonian deputy prime

782
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,679
minister um

783
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,360
minister sacranska you represent the

784
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
youngest member of nato

785
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,240
and i've heard from some of your

786
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,120
neighbors

787
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,440
um some who are not yet under the nato

788
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,399
umbrella

789
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,279
that they really envy that you now have

790
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,080
article 5

791
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,200
protection do you think other nato

792
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,320
members

793
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,840
who might be dragging their feet on

794
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,320
adding these new countries in

795
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,880
do they understand how it feels for your

796
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,320
people

797
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,360
the fear well thank you uh

798
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,799
globsec for trying to get us more into

799
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,960
what we considered the normal

800
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,200
uh it's it's difficult with masks and

801
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,039
everything but it's much better than

802
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,559
than the year the last year that we

803
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,080
remember um

804
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,840
well thank you actually very much for

805
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,440
the question uh

806
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,919
we have been striving to become a nato

807
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,679
member for 30 years this was the first

808
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,799
time actually

809
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,120
that our parliament expressed the

810
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,640
interest to join nato

811
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,279
and just as we were moving closer i was

812
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,600
amazed especially in the last few years

813
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,720
how many people within the family

814
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,000
take the family and the values

815
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,440
and article 5 for granted and

816
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,480
and they have learned to become a bit

817
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,240
complacent

818
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,279
and i i would always ask them to look

819
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,760
uh towards the alliance uh through the

820
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,520
eyes of an outsider

821
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,600
and to try and appreciate more what they

822
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,640
have so

823
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,760
uh for after almost 30 years of working

824
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,520
very hard to get into the alliance it

825
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,360
was a major victory

826
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,919
it did happen in the midst of the corona

827
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,120
crisis so there was no

828
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,399
celebratory mode in in the country

829
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,679
uh but to have article five

830
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,039
uh and to have membership in

831
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,279
the strongest military and political

832
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,039
alliance in the world

833
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,919
20 years after having nato troops within

834
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,799
the country

835
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,480
first to help us deal with our own

836
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,159
internal problems and

837
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,080
some of the regional instabilities it's

838
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,159
a major transformation

839
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,600
and this is why i think even during the

840
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,159
discussions at the summit

841
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,840
i think we were among the more

842
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,399
optimistic tones

843
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,840
because uh i do remember the times when

844
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,720
we were

845
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,000
uh just waiting for the entry uh

846
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
and waiting probably for the entry in

847
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,360
the worst possible moment for the

848
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,519
alliance because back in 2018 when we

849
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,960
got the invitation

850
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,120
many people started asking me how come

851
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
you want to get into the alliance and

852
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,880
you know we have fears whether the

853
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,880
alliance will survive

854
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,600
things have changed and i think that the

855
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,080
the

856
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,360
the summit uh showed incredible

857
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,880
uh display of uh not only unity

858
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,240
but awareness of how strategic

859
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,559
the importance of the alliance is and it

860
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,120
was a music to our ears

861
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,600
following up on that do you think the

862
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,799
black swan

863
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,720
could be an entry of russian troops into

864
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,399
ukraine instead of just building up on

865
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:21,120
the border

866
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,600
would would nato respond would you push

867
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,440
for nato to respond

868
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,039
uh if there is one lesson bad lesson

869
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:29,519
that we

870
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,799
we we learned expect the unexpected and

871
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,679
uh i when you when i heard you mention

872
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,120
again black swan

873
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,000
i i almost had the idea that some of the

874
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,039
things that happened

875
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,240
back home exactly three years ago

876
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,919
we signed the presby agreement with

877
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,159
greece for many people it was the black

878
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,120
swan

879
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,440
not in terms of of the negative

880
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,200
repercussions of course in terms of

881
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,559
surprise

882
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,200
it was we got used to the dispute with

883
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,799
greece

884
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,840
nobody expected a breakthrough uh nobody

885
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,200
expected follow-up

886
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
many people who saw us sign the

887
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,240
agreement with greece i said

888
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,320
okay there is goodwill between the two

889
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,279
governments

890
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,320
but it will never work and thirdly and i

891
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,640
think that this was the big surprise

892
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,120
it was an utterly homemade i would say

893
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,399
balkan made

894
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,440
compromise friends helped with strong

895
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,120
support with strong messages

896
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,960
but genuinely it was the political will

897
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,480
of the two governments

898
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,519
to make a meaningful u-turn and

899
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,679
and this is how we became a nato member

900
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,880
state and

901
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,200
this is why uh i think that when we talk

902
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,279
about black swan events

903
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:40,080
we should also try to challenge us

904
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,440
sometimes to do

905
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,960
braver things especially politicians

906
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
doing something brave

907
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,600
means doing something risky but it's

908
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,320
it's what we are elected to do we are

909
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,559
elected to challenge the status quo

910
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,519
every time we can encounter a problem

911
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,000
and

912
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,679
uh especially when it comes to nato uh

913
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,360
article five is not the only element of

914
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,559
the alliance

915
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,679
we have talked a lot about values but

916
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,480
it's

917
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,520
an elementary part although when i look

918
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,000
at the

919
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,320
the screen uh with the small poll that

920
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,520
we did here

921
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,359
you see the big russia sign you see

922
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:20,960
relatively big china

923
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,280
but if you combine several other things

924
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,159
that have appeared

925
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,560
on on the on the screen you will see

926
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,520
resilience

927
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,239
you will see uh lost confidence you will

928
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:30,560
see

929
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,599
vulnerabilities within our own societies

930
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,119
i think that the real black swan

931
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,960
which shouldn't be actually a surprise

932
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,239
to us all

933
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,440
is are the weaknesses of our our

934
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,399
internal democratic structures if we

935
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,119
don't fail

936
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,239
them we won't fail

937
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,679
when crisis calls upon us thank you

938
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,359
and by the way that's obviously a huge

939
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,200
portfolio and i i realize

940
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,920
defense minister and scott i aired in

941
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,880
trying to add

942
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
to your already burgeoning portfolio by

943
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,040
also making you a deputy prime minister

944
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,359
so moving on over to vancouver

945
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,440
um minister you have waited patiently

946
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,160
i i know that within your portfolio is

947
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,040
also

948
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,200
uh canada's cryptologic intelligence

949
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
agency the communication security

950
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,119
establishment or cse

951
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,400
a la gchq and nsa um

952
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,839
is your black swan possibly related to

953
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,440
that

954
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
um no thank you very much uh again for

955
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,480
the question and thank

956
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,640
globetsek for inviting me once again and

957
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,800
alongside my esteemed colleagues

958
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,960
it's great to be uh virtually connected

959
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,480
with you from vancouver

960
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,720
when it comes to a black swan event i

961
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,320
think it's

962
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
we look at what is the likelihood of

963
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
something to take place

964
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,680
and for example there's climate change

965
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,000
there's many other events that we have

966
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,040
seen in terms of when we

967
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,320
when we talk about russia their uh uh

968
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,240
illegal annexation of crimea what's

969
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,640
happening in the donbass area

970
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,760
uh of ukraine russia's already set a

971
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,560
pattern

972
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,480
so i don't really consider that a black

973
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,760
swan i see that a

974
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,480
pattern and then our actions will

975
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,680
counter that pattern

976
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,040
when i look at black swan events um i do

977
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,480
look at

978
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,960
the cybersphere and i'm very concerned

979
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,240
uh with this

980
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,320
it's not just about cyber attacks and

981
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,359
we've seen

982
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:34,320
what can happen to democracies when

983
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,599
cyber attacks

984
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,079
are incorporated within a hybrid warfare

985
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,280
context

986
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,640
now when you take things to the next

987
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,560
level which is probably my biggest

988
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,200
concerns

989
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,240
uh in terms of black swan events is when

990
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,960
you

991
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,400
incorporate artificial intelligence the

992
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,839
progress of algorithms have

993
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,680
increased significantly nation states

994
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,280
have already

995
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,800
understood the importance of the

996
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,119
collection of data because as you know

997
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,640
artificial intelligence or or out

998
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,520
good algorithms um cannot work unless

999
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,800
you have significant amount of data

1000
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,760
so when you combine those two uh it

1001
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,680
gives a significant concern because it

1002
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,160
allows

1003
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,000
states that who have underlying

1004
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,280
uh reasons to take things to the next

1005
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,720
level where they may not be

1006
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,640
able to get away uh because it would

1007
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,160
increase the threshold

1008
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,040
of response from other nations the cyber

1009
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,680
world

1010
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,280
allows you to do things that uh

1011
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,359
may not get us enough attention so as um

1012
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,359
as i guess from the the previous panel

1013
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,400
talked about

1014
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,560
uh infrastructure that is being created

1015
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,079
around the world we need to be

1016
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,320
very mindful of what type of

1017
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,599
infrastructure

1018
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,920
who is building it does it have that

1019
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,599
cyber resiliency

1020
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,440
because the last thing you want is all

1021
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,359
of a sudden in your nation

1022
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,280
that uh uh

1023
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,400
something to take place that that

1024
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,320
uh with an on and off switch is in in a

1025
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,440
different country

1026
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,480
we have already seen organized crime

1027
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,400
use uh ransomware and hold

1028
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,359
multi-million or million dollar

1029
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,880
companies to account or even a billion

1030
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,760
dollar companies

1031
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,440
to account so this is something that we

1032
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,359
need to be very mindful and get ready

1033
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:29,839
for

1034
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,560
um but something that nato and and it's

1035
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,320
uh uh

1036
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,079
all the respective nations are taking it

1037
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,000
very seriously and bringing our

1038
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,079
collective experience together

1039
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,440
to making sure that we build not only

1040
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,440
look at it from a defense perspective

1041
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,560
but look at it as

1042
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,720
a building resiliency in your own

1043
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,040
nations as well

1044
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,400
well i want to move on to the headlines

1045
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,880
and and pick up with what minister

1046
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,119
sergeant was just talking about

1047
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,400
in the nato communique in the the stated

1048
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,160
goals of nato

1049
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
do you think there was enough in there

1050
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,280
to dissuade

1051
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,040
russia or other malign cyber actors

1052
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,640
um from conducting continuing activities

1053
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,400
was there enough teeth in there

1054
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,000
um one i would say yes

1055
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,119
we when it comes to words that

1056
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,680
uh we put out as nations and especially

1057
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,960
as part of nato

1058
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,640
uh words do matter at that level

1059
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
obviously and what we don't want to do

1060
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,760
is escalate

1061
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,680
any type of tension but having said this

1062
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,240
those words have significant meaning

1063
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
because those words are backed up by the

1064
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,720
30 nations and the resources and the

1065
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,359
people

1066
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,680
within those nations and i can assure

1067
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,359
you from a canadian perspective

1068
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,800
we have significant talent to be able to

1069
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,520
contribute

1070
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,440
so as we build our own uh

1071
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,560
not build but enhance our capabilities

1072
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,560
went into the cyber world artificial

1073
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,319
intelligence and we have significant

1074
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,040
uh experience um let's go to the next

1075
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,800
level uh when it comes to quantum

1076
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,920
computing

1077
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,560
uh we have that uh investment but we

1078
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,119
also

1079
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,599
have now the collective will the

1080
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,319
collective

1081
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,119
resources the con the collective i want

1082
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,319
to talk about resource not

1083
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,119
just dollars i'm talking about people

1084
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:25,599
that's

1085
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,440
what is needed to making sure that we

1086
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,880
take things to the new level

1087
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,839
the institutions and and i think no

1088
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:32,400
nation

1089
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,000
should uh that wants to

1090
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,079
create attention should ever

1091
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,480
take that as that their the will is not

1092
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,839
there so we will

1093
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,880
we want to prevent conflict we need to

1094
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,000
get into a place

1095
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,880
where we're actually de-escalating but

1096
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,280
uh

1097
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,680
but as nato's role is to making sure

1098
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,160
that we prevent so those words do have

1099
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,960
significant teeth i can assure you so

1100
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,240
you're talking about

1101
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,560
following through with the rattling of

1102
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,640
the saber having a real concrete

1103
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,680
threat of response so to bring it back

1104
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,319
in the room here

1105
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,240
president biden told vladimir putin this

1106
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,480
week that if there was

1107
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,960
a continuing cyber campaign another

1108
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,280
solar winds campaign for instance

1109
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,480
that he would respond with cyber weapons

1110
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,440
uh should nato be issuing similar

1111
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,839
threats

1112
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,400
if you're asking me uh you know

1113
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,319
we've been we've been saying this uh for

1114
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:37,839
a decade already that it's very

1115
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:38,960
difficult to

1116
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,319
uh respond uh to adversary

1117
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,359
uh while you're limited by law you're

1118
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,960
limited by a legal system

1119
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
and you want to obey you want to obey

1120
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,440
and you you act in line with law

1121
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,400
uh yes uh harjit already mentioned that

1122
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,839
we are capable

1123
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:58,160
we are capable of doing certain things

1124
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,440
that you wouldn't even be

1125
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,599
you wouldn't be uh it wouldn't be

1126
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,280
possible for you to imagine

1127
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,440
uh but we don't do that because we are

1128
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,119
limited because we are limited by the

1129
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,200
law but if somebody is still pushing

1130
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,680
hard

1131
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,920
and more and more on you then you need

1132
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,960
to act

1133
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,640
and we need to be you know we need to

1134
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,920
face this new situation and uh

1135
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,960
and act with adequate way uh you know

1136
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,240
the recent situation with

1137
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,760
the pipelines in the united states you

1138
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,359
know this is something even i think that

1139
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,200
president biden already mentioned that

1140
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,920
this is the red line you don't do that

1141
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,280
russia wouldn't be happy if

1142
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,960
if we all focus on pipelines that they

1143
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,640
have

1144
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,880
this is critical infrastructure and uh

1145
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,920
you know

1146
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,119
if you allow various actors to state or

1147
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:41,839
non-stand

1148
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,760
state but actors from your country to to

1149
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,000
to focus and to attack uh the critical

1150
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,960
infrastructure

1151
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,480
then you need to simply wait for

1152
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,160
reaction that's reality

1153
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,079
and we are capable the united states is

1154
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,160
capable canada is capable and many of us

1155
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,319
we're capable also not only on cyber

1156
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,800
defense but also on cyber attack

1157
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,359
do we want to do that well uh you know

1158
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,800
if necessary

1159
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,240
uh we should uh really uh

1160
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,440
uh consider all options

1161
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,680
yet whenever i hear about cyber defense

1162
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,760
and especially cyber offense

1163
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,720
i hear top security officials say you

1164
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,319
know the norms aren't clear

1165
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:23,520
we haven't decided what would trigger

1166
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,560
a cyber offensive attack minister

1167
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,440
sacransko

1168
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,200
what would you think is the threshold

1169
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,800
after which um is it disinformation

1170
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,400
is it interfering in a a nato country's

1171
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,440
elections

1172
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,520
or is it critical infrastructure

1173
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,760
well if we are open we'll say that all

1174
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,280
these three lines

1175
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,640
have been crossed already and we have

1176
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,079
seen the price

1177
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,040
and we have seen how disruptive they

1178
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,960
they are

1179
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,440
and this is why in my view uh the

1180
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,319
scenarios

1181
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,079
for a cyber offensive have to be

1182
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,560
developed

1183
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,800
we all hope that the words will be

1184
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,760
enough

1185
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,400
we all hope that the message will be

1186
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:10,800
sent

1187
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,200
out loud and clear and will be

1188
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,800
understood properly

1189
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,359
but we also have to prepare for

1190
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,880
different scenarios

1191
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,960
and in my mind this is why the summit

1192
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,400
was so important

1193
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,560
the reliability of our alliance

1194
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:31,119
is key in the deterrence are we for real

1195
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,359
when we say that actions have their

1196
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:34,880
consequences

1197
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,560
are we you know dedicated to article 5

1198
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,839
even in this uh

1199
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:42,720
more general form of attacking critical

1200
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,000
infrastructure

1201
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,359
or attacking our basic tenants of life

1202
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:47,839
like

1203
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,160
election process you don't need to

1204
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,359
conquer a country

1205
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,280
you just destroy the confidence in their

1206
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,040
electoral process and you have done most

1207
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,240
of the work

1208
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,000
this is why in my view one of the

1209
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,599
elements that were mentioned in the

1210
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,520
summit and around the summit

1211
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,640
was the importance of technology and

1212
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,040
maintaining the technological edge of

1213
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,560
the alliance

1214
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,640
it's not just having the technological

1215
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,599
means

1216
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,839
it's also shaping the technological

1217
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,040
regulation

1218
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,200
and i think it was president biden who

1219
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,119
actually said it before the summit

1220
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,960
that the the use and the regulation for

1221
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,720
for new technologies have to be dictated

1222
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,200
by

1223
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,760
our values and not by the interest of

1224
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,440
autocratic regimes

1225
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,480
i think this is uh practically the new

1226
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,720
international order for 21st century

1227
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,200
how do we regulate them and how do we

1228
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,839
use

1229
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,880
our maybe backdated international

1230
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,720
rules order in this new environment

1231
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,119
uh it's it's uh technological

1232
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:49,920
development

1233
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,400
it's uh globalization it's climate

1234
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,160
change all these forces

1235
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,280
are shaping our world at an

1236
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,520
unprecedented

1237
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,119
pace and they are a potential for

1238
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,040
groups of people that can save the world

1239
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,560
but they are a potential

1240
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,319
for groups of within the world that can

1241
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:09,119
destroy it uh who will be faster

1242
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,240
will prevail well that brings me to

1243
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:15,599
um a frequent mantra of uh general ben

1244
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,760
hodges who's now retired but he used to

1245
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,200
say the only way

1246
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,359
nato is going to succeed is through

1247
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,880
speed of recognition

1248
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,079
of the problem speed of decision about

1249
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,440
what to do about it

1250
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,400
and then speed of assembly which uh we

1251
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,079
all know is rather difficult

1252
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,319
to get from point a to point b across

1253
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:35,920
several european countries because of

1254
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,880
things like

1255
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,640
roads not being able to take the weight

1256
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,000
of the tanks or

1257
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,599
different rail gauges etc

1258
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,200
but but on that speed of decision

1259
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,119
how hard do you think it would be to get

1260
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,240
30 countries just

1261
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,440
to decide to cyber hack back

1262
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,000
against russia and would you call for it

1263
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,040
here

1264
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,800
well you know whether i i used to work

1265
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,040
for our delegation to nato and uh

1266
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,319
and have been very open uh sometimes

1267
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:07,280
it was frustrating uh to to be a member

1268
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,240
of the committee and

1269
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,160
uh to negotiate and negotiate and

1270
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,280
negotiate

1271
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,520
uh still with one or or two countries

1272
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,720
that don't you know

1273
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,480
follow uh the majority of countries

1274
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,359
around the table

1275
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:20,800
in certain things just because of

1276
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,359
national interest

1277
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,440
yeah it's not easy uh the question is

1278
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,640
whether we should uh

1279
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,599
lift up you know the consensus policy uh

1280
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,880
you know in defense planning we have

1281
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,720
consensus minus one policy and it worked

1282
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,760
quite well

1283
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,400
uh yeah but it's still alliance right

1284
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,680
and you know alliance one one of the

1285
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,079
biggest

1286
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,559
uh advantages that it's uh consensus

1287
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,119
based

1288
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,359
uh so yeah it's it's a difficult issue

1289
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,160
but yes

1290
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,920
uh there were some situations in the

1291
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,280
history of nato when

1292
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,040
uh the agreement uh even did not come

1293
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,240
uh or uh it took very long time

1294
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,800
uh so but as you know i still believe

1295
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,359
that you know

1296
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,680
in situations like uh article five

1297
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,040
situations when the

1298
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,000
the situation is really uh difficult and

1299
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,920
under pressure then i believe that all

1300
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,880
countries

1301
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,800
would eventually come to a joint

1302
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
solution and i don't think that if

1303
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,240
the situation is really crucial and

1304
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,640
difficult then that that did we would

1305
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:18,400
wait for somebody else trying to

1306
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,240
push hard for their national interest

1307
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,240
and and blackmail others with

1308
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:25,599
their you know national interests uh uh

1309
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,160
instead of uh playing the same the same

1310
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,680
game with with the others so

1311
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,440
uh i don't think this will be a big

1312
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,880
problem but yes some

1313
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,319
uh some uh bigger or

1314
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,599
high quality uh decision making in nato

1315
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,000
uh

1316
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,200
is a very uh good uh topic for the next

1317
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,240
conference

1318
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:47,200
fantastic okay so we have a little over

1319
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,240
half an hour left

1320
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,559
but before i turn to audience questions

1321
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:51,839
and we've already got some great ones

1322
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:52,720
coming in um

1323
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,280
i'll also call on you in the room um i i

1324
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,800
did want to talk about

1325
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,079
um the uh as our

1326
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,680
north macedonian minister has mentioned

1327
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,839
technology um

1328
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:07,200
i got the honor of being part of

1329
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,400
globe sex outreach to industry on behalf

1330
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,200
of nato

1331
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,079
where they put members of industry on

1332
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,000
chatham house rules panels together

1333
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,319
with nato officials and i got the most

1334
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,480
unusual instruction i've ever gotten as

1335
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,440
a moderator

1336
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,400
they said we want people to be blunt we

1337
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,040
want

1338
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,200
criticism and because it was chatham

1339
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,319
house rules i can't tell you what the

1340
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,359
criticism was but

1341
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,880
but the the industry officials were

1342
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,480
blunt um

1343
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,359
and uh

1344
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,000
one of the things that we all know is a

1345
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,599
problem is

1346
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,839
speed of implementation and nato's

1347
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:44,480
acquisition program

1348
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,520
which um has been described to me as

1349
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,240
uh so outdated that often the adversary

1350
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,680
is already working on the

1351
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,160
third iteration of the nato design by

1352
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,920
the time it rolls off the nato assembly

1353
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,720
line

1354
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,240
so so um i'd like to start with our

1355
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,920
canadian uh colleague uh

1356
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,760
nato also announced on monday an

1357
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,040
accelerator

1358
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
for industry and new funding for

1359
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,240
industry to kind of

1360
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,040
try to jump start this process you have

1361
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,280
something similar in canada

1362
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,200
is it is it a model nato could follow

1363
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,160
because it sounds like what they

1364
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,240
outlined monday was very

1365
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,640
um fluffy not a lot of detail yet

1366
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,960
i i think uh one is also to your

1367
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,720
previous questions when it comes to

1368
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,359
nato and we look at nato consensus and

1369
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:32,640
the work that you do

1370
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,200
and it seems cumbersome but these are

1371
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,520
the values that are very important

1372
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,000
that uh uh that gives us that deterrence

1373
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,240
is you have 30 nations who are coming

1374
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,119
together

1375
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,960
and when they do come together to make

1376
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,040
that decision on consensus

1377
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,760
it means something but let's not forget

1378
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,880
we also

1379
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,640
not only as as as as nations but

1380
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,680
we work bilaterally uh we on security

1381
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,720
issues

1382
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,319
there's so many things that are

1383
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,760
happening with within the nato context

1384
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,319
even though it might be bilateral that

1385
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:09,680
it it

1386
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,720
those those initiatives enhance

1387
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,240
nato as well so when it comes to

1388
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,599
uh innovation this is something that we

1389
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,720
took very seriously

1390
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,559
and actually had that direct

1391
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,160
conversation with the industry when we

1392
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:24,800
created

1393
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,200
our defense policy because we knew that

1394
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:27,839
we

1395
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,920
in the uh in the military could not

1396
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,680
succeed without

1397
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,760
uh without industry so we asked them

1398
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,880
blunt questions

1399
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,960
what what where are we failing what do

1400
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,040
we need to do and they were very blunt

1401
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,800
and they said we it's easier to work

1402
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,640
outside of canada than inside canada so

1403
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,000
we wanted to change that

1404
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,520
so we started to look at changing

1405
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,680
procurement rules we they also said we

1406
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,240
don't know

1407
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,920
what you're working towards it's all

1408
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,599
something so classified

1409
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,680
we need predictability so what we did

1410
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,839
was one was give greater predictability

1411
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,280
and so we put out

1412
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,280
not only our defense policy but a

1413
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,160
defense investment plan out for 10 years

1414
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,400
and we updated every uh three to four

1415
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,480
years so they get predictability

1416
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,000
but through that from the innovation

1417
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,520
side what we wanted to do is

1418
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,839
we throw challenges so what we a program

1419
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:13,599
we call ideas innovation for defense

1420
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,680
excellence and security

1421
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,720
throw out challenges um not just to

1422
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,599
industry to academia to anybody

1423
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,119
working even in a garage if they have an

1424
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,760
idea is here's a challenge that we have

1425
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,880
and and they will propose ideas

1426
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,720
they will compete with those ideas will

1427
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,319
be competed and

1428
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,960
it what it goes through a panel and then

1429
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,839
we invest

1430
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:38,960
in that idea if that idea shows progress

1431
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,160
we will invest greater

1432
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,680
uh greater resources and money and then

1433
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,760
this helps whether it's a company an

1434
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,839
individual academia

1435
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,160
take their idea to a new level but we

1436
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,680
get to be the benefactor

1437
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,160
beneficiary of utilizing it so at the

1438
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,359
same time

1439
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,240
as canada benefits our nato allies

1440
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,960
benefit

1441
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,640
uh as well so um so

1442
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,400
so in a roundabout way we're all

1443
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,720
benefiting together having said this

1444
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,800
yes absolutely we need to be able to

1445
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,559
share our ideas and this is something

1446
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,760
that has worked very well

1447
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,119
and we're actually already modifying

1448
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,000
things because we have classified things

1449
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,119
so often

1450
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,359
that sometimes the civilian sector has

1451
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,040
already solved that problem

1452
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,800
so what i've said to our innovation

1453
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,160
folks is get out there

1454
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,720
see what what the industry is doing

1455
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,599
sometimes

1456
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,520
a little tweak here and there with a

1457
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,000
product can be of great value

1458
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,480
um to us so but we don't just look at it

1459
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,240
from a defense from a cyber

1460
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,319
or or weapons or defensive weapons we're

1461
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,400
also looking at how we manage our people

1462
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:40,960
as well

1463
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,280
how we have dealt with the pandemic um

1464
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,160
so it has been

1465
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,800
very successful um and where we've been

1466
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,359
for example invested 1.6 million dollars

1467
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,839
over the 20-year lifespan of our defense

1468
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:52,559
policy

1469
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,440
just in the ideas program minister

1470
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,880
sergeant is there anything like a

1471
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,680
specific

1472
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,079
product that you've been able to almost

1473
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,359
bring to market through this process

1474
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,920
um there's many things uh uh that we've

1475
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,040
done so for example

1476
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,960
um how we uh recreate uh recruit

1477
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,319
um uh in greater diversity recruiting a

1478
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:15,760
woman but we also

1479
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,720
um uh for example during this pandemic

1480
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,040
how

1481
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,800
um a certain pro reusable

1482
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,880
uh ppe we're also have um

1483
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,640
you know smaller challenges and how for

1484
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,119
example with people with uh with beards

1485
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:33,680
uh in the military how do you how do you

1486
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,240
put a

1487
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,000
respirator on we're also looking at

1488
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,319
everything from in the cyber domain

1489
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,079
so there's many different examples that

1490
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,359
can be uh that

1491
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:44,720
that i can utilize and we've

1492
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,960
uh have many products that are moving

1493
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,240
but probably the most

1494
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,680
the beneficial side that i have seen is

1495
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,040
that collaboration

1496
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,359
that that has taken place those networks

1497
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,640
that are creating

1498
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,040
because one uh product over here or

1499
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:01,760
discussion

1500
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,720
may lead to um other ideas and and what

1501
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:05,680
i've said is this

1502
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,079
is putting finding that right talent is

1503
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:08,960
probably the more

1504
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,720
even far more important than the one

1505
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,319
product it's itself

1506
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,240
and we're working very closely with the

1507
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,640
us obviously when it comes to the arctic

1508
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,200
on what type of uh security challenges

1509
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,480
that we see you see

1510
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,400
in the north and uh we want to be able

1511
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,760
to share a lot of that experience

1512
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,240
with with our nato allies as well thank

1513
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:26,960
you

1514
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,000
um with that i would like to turn to the

1515
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,040
audience i already

1516
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,640
gave you a heads up we'd be turning to

1517
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,000
questions and we've got some good ones

1518
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,119
coming in

1519
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,319
but i would like to do to pulse you with

1520
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,440
a word cloud

1521
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,480
through your slido app and

1522
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,839
ask you all what you see it as the

1523
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,160
top obstacle to nato modernization and

1524
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,319
interoperability

1525
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,960
picking up on what mr minister sajin was

1526
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,520
just talking about

1527
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,480
and as you all think about that i see

1528
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,520
some people picking up their apps

1529
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,799
i will go to one of the first questions

1530
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,000
oh actually i should wait until

1531
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,160
i should i should let the the screen

1532
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,640
populate a little bit more

1533
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:15,520
i'm rushing people's thought process

1534
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,280
consensus

1535
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,720
huh the defense industry

1536
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,480
ah as an obstacle um

1537
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,000
we'll have to have some conversations

1538
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,040
over the uh that end lunch about that

1539
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,880
um private sector leading that could be

1540
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,480
um well one of the complaints i

1541
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,839
frequently hear from the defense

1542
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,960
industry is

1543
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,520
uh they are brought into the process too

1544
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,720
late in the game

1545
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,559
and then are told to like basically we

1546
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:44,960
need you to produce a solution overnight

1547
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,480
and of course classification issues are

1548
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,000
part of the problem

1549
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,520
as mr sergeant also mentioned

1550
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,599
bureaucracy is the one

1551
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,480
that is coming up the most so the system

1552
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:55,839
that is supposed to help us

1553
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:58,640
is slowing us down wow a lot lot for

1554
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,160
defense industry

1555
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,440
sorry guys um north south infrastructure

1556
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,799
that's something that we have also heard

1557
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:06,079
about you know

1558
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,119
russia was able to get all of its troops

1559
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,319
um to where it intended very quickly

1560
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,720
during its recent zapad exercises

1561
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,760
whereas i understand that nato had some

1562
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,119
people that took

1563
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,119
days if not weeks to get there because

1564
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:22,720
some of their equipment wouldn't fit on

1565
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,640
the right trains or certain trains can

1566
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,520
only take

1567
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,480
military cargo overnight et cetera et

1568
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,079
cetera

1569
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,520
so let me turn to a question from

1570
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,960
uh matu slovaki from moody's data shows

1571
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,520
increased

1572
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,760
activity of chinese state-owned

1573
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,559
companies buying intellectual property

1574
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,200
how can you avoid hegemony of some vital

1575
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,000
aspects

1576
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,440
things like 5g and quantum computing

1577
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,760
so so that's that's some something i i

1578
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,319
heard debated a lot in nsa and gchq

1579
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:56,160
circles

1580
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,040
people don't understand they would say

1581
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,319
that

1582
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,920
china is buying their way into your

1583
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,400
systems

1584
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,599
minister would you like to take that one

1585
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,160
oh

1586
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,280
well on on 5g we have been rather

1587
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,480
bold lately uh based on some

1588
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,960
negative experiences uh back home in

1589
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,480
north macedonia but also

1590
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,720
in the region we have signed a

1591
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,440
memorandum of understanding with the u.s

1592
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,000
uh saying that we will be very

1593
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,280
restrictive

1594
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,920
on on technology coming from countries

1595
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,920
where there is no democratic control

1596
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,599
and there are vested and hidden

1597
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,359
interests

1598
00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,040
it's a document that can be signed but

1599
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,240
implementation

1600
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,319
lags behind because it requires a lot of

1601
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,920
procedural things

1602
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,559
and what we have been focusing lately is

1603
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,160
of course the discussion about

1604
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,400
strategic investments and screening of

1605
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,559
strategic investors

1606
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,040
we have had some experience with chinese

1607
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,839
loans on infrastructure

1608
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,440
not as bad as some of the other

1609
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,960
countries in the balkans

1610
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,839
but we are still waiting for one of the

1611
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,760
very expensive highways to be

1612
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,119
to be constructed but we saw this as an

1613
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,520
element of vulnerability

1614
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,240
uh not because infrastructure is only

1615
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,160
important for defense as you said

1616
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,119
but because it it it undermines the

1617
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:20,480
institutions

1618
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,839
so uh i do believe that what we can work

1619
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:24,160
with

1620
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,599
is a much better cooperation within nato

1621
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,440
on discussing our own internal

1622
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,799
regulations

1623
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,680
i'm sometimes shocked when you know a

1624
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,760
conversation between two ministers can

1625
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,760
touch a very sensitive thing on how do

1626
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,240
we do

1627
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,400
these procurements better how do we

1628
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,520
protect ourselves

1629
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:43,599
in these sensitive areas better and

1630
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,160
sometimes a 15-minute discussion

1631
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,240
actually can be more helpful to us as

1632
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,280
ministers

1633
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,680
than long discussions and long documents

1634
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,480
that haven't

1635
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,839
led us anywhere so in my view uh

1636
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:59,359
uh on on mobility it's a shame

1637
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,319
that we cannot do better uh we have been

1638
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,680
discussing this issue

1639
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:06,160
uh there were movements but because of

1640
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,000
national regulations and because

1641
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,079
we are used to things moving slowly on

1642
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,359
these fronts

1643
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,599
uh i think that we are lagging behind we

1644
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,160
are dealing with strategic adversary in

1645
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,760
countries where

1646
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,799
institutions uh private sector and

1647
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:22,480
academia

1648
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,720
work under the same umbrella all the

1649
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,760
time

1650
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,040
and we cannot afford a relaxed

1651
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,040
relationship and i think we should go

1652
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,559
back to the basis and discuss

1653
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,480
some of the our experiences with

1654
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,599
regulation

1655
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,839
and reconsider some of them i saw the

1656
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,119
bureaucracy

1657
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,480
looming from the screen but we are

1658
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,319
victims of our own successes

1659
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,359
i mean the whole procurement uh policy

1660
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:48,720
has been developed

1661
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,559
on the premises of transparency

1662
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,720
competition and it has brought huge

1663
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,960
dividends

1664
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,119
now you know there are some costs

1665
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,799
attached to it so we should

1666
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:00,960
look at these issues with a fresh set of

1667
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,359
eyes and i think that we can we should

1668
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,280
reconsider some of these things

1669
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,319
uh a discussion with industry is great

1670
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,599
but you know uh defense is about huge

1671
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:12,640
acquisitions

1672
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,119
huge amounts of money if you talk to the

1673
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,680
industry sometimes you are attacked

1674
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,400
for liaising with them or or having

1675
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,280
vested interest

1676
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,920
so how do you go around this maintaining

1677
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,240
the confidence of our citizens

1678
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,720
while making these procurements

1679
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,760
realistic

1680
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,559
goals and making them successful i don't

1681
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:32,960
think

1682
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,000
it's not an easy equation but i think

1683
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,359
that some of the countries were more

1684
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:38,079
successful

1685
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,640
in dealing with them and i think eve you

1686
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,240
know new countries especially but even

1687
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,920
some of the old member states

1688
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,720
should not shy away from uh you know

1689
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,359
maybe

1690
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,400
reassessing the policies thank you um if

1691
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,839
anyone in the room would like to stand

1692
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,599
up and ask a question raise your hand so

1693
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:54,640
i can um

1694
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,920
spot you um but in the meantime i have a

1695
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,559
question

1696
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,480
um oh uh mister you wanted to add

1697
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,000
yeah i just wanted to add a few things

1698
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,599
on the three points that were raised

1699
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,280
here first of all uh

1700
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,839
yeah if you would be asking me on ops on

1701
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,039
the biggest obstacle

1702
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:13,359
uh then it's definitely and i and i had

1703
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:14,079
it written

1704
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,960
before it appeared on the screen a legal

1705
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,079
uh regulation

1706
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:21,440
in public procurement i mean uh

1707
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,599
at a certain period of time you you have

1708
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:25,440
to acquire something uh

1709
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,000
uh really fast and especially with the

1710
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,920
covet situation for example

1711
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,559
this is the lesson that we learned uh a

1712
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:33,599
year ago

1713
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,799
and uh it took us a very long time in

1714
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,880
order to follow all the regulations uh

1715
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,760
and realize that actually uh this is

1716
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,640
this is a

1717
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,760
legal regulation for good times but for

1718
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,000
bad times uh you need something else and

1719
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,200
i honestly saying now

1720
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,920
we had a ballot discussion with my uh

1721
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,720
dear colleague

1722
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,640
ramila and uh we actually had very

1723
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:56,480
similar positions in terms of

1724
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,200
how we can uh fasten the whole process

1725
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,160
uh make it uh

1726
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,319
make it really fast including things

1727
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:03,520
like nato

1728
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:04,960
supplies and procurement agency that

1729
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,640
that works quite well for slovakia for

1730
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,440
example

1731
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,079
or uh american system foreign military

1732
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,720
sales or

1733
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,440
for military fund or canadian uh

1734
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:14,240
hardship good

1735
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,319
good thing is also your ccc system that

1736
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:17,599
you have uh

1737
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,680
for procurement uh on bilateral gtg

1738
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,359
basis this is something that we

1739
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,599
should use more and you know while

1740
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,039
talking about this i also

1741
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,640
also mentioned the cooperation with the

1742
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,319
private sector which is extremely

1743
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:29,599
crucially important because you know

1744
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,839
usually we are users we would like to

1745
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,760
have a certain uh capability but

1746
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,880
it's actually usually uh the private

1747
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,039
sector that comes with solutions

1748
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,559
uh and you know i i i'm the one who

1749
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:44,960
is not you know afraid of meeting uh

1750
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,839
companies

1751
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:47,520
because for us for defence ministers it

1752
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,520
is extremely important to talk to

1753
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,799
state sector ngo academia and the

1754
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,160
private sector if you want to

1755
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,599
if you want to be responsible for whole

1756
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,920
defense then the defense sector is

1757
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,440
defense industry

1758
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,839
it's uh extremely important and last

1759
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,200
point on 5g

1760
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,880
uh yes very similar to torad mila's

1761
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,640
point we have also signed the memorandum

1762
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,240
of united states on on

1763
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,680
you know being very responsible in 5g

1764
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,119
but you know being honest uh

1765
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:18,880
the pressure economic pressure that

1766
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,880
comes from countries that uh

1767
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,000
might create difficulties for us in 5g

1768
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,799
uh

1769
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,119
area this economic pressure the

1770
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,880
financial pressure is extreme

1771
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,799
and it's sometimes it's uh yes it's the

1772
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:33,920
discussion about uh

1773
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,480
values about security but it's also

1774
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,520
discussion

1775
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,720
on the cabinet level about uh labor

1776
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:41,599
about money

1777
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,640
about investments and uh this discussion

1778
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:45,599
is not black and white

1779
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,079
obviously so you know security on one

1780
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:48,960
side

1781
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,520
but new jobs for uh undeveloped areas in

1782
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,280
slovakia on other side right

1783
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,280
and you need to you need to find a

1784
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,680
proper proper balance

1785
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,839
before i go to another app question i i

1786
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:01,039
would like to ask

1787
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,039
minister sajon i you um especially with

1788
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:05,520
your

1789
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,480
um oversight over cse you must

1790
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,200
understand

1791
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,319
better than most what technical

1792
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,599
capabilities

1793
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:16,559
various cyber actors have um including

1794
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,480
china

1795
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:21,920
can you a lot of europeans uh nato

1796
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,280
members

1797
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,119
apparently pushed back behind closed

1798
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,280
doors at the nato summit

1799
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,240
and basically said to the white house uh

1800
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,920
to president biden

1801
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,319
you have this jingoistic fight going on

1802
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:34,960
against

1803
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,359
china and you want us to cut them off

1804
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:39,200
but they're one of the world's largest

1805
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:39,680
um

1806
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,960
manufacturers we can't do that

1807
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,960
can you can you come in as a as a

1808
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,559
kind of the neutral actor to explain

1809
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,720
the threat of china without people

1810
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:53,599
dismissing it

1811
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,290
as you know a fight between um

1812
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,440
[Music]

1813
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,920
two two kids in the schoolyard a

1814
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,079
dangerous fight

1815
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,920
no absolutely i think extremely

1816
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,119
important you want to take canada's

1817
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,480
example on this um

1818
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,119
i mean our history is known we canada is

1819
01:06:09,119 --> 01:06:10,559
a peace-loving nation we've

1820
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,200
but we've been uh taking part in every

1821
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,680
nato

1822
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,720
uh opera operations um uh

1823
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,039
and in when we're trying to be a

1824
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,720
responsible partner in the in

1825
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,599
in the world uh all of a sudden uh a

1826
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:24,799
nation like china

1827
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:27,680
uh uh arbitrarily detains your citizens

1828
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,640
um

1829
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,880
because uh of uh um

1830
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,240
and sorry and that hostage diplomacy

1831
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,440
that takes place

1832
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,240
all of a sudden changes your perspective

1833
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:40,720
um

1834
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,839
on things so we know

1835
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:47,520
that china has obviously a

1836
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,599
value and a responsibility in the world

1837
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,520
they're growing economic power we all

1838
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:52,240
know that

1839
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,160
there is an opportunity for everyone to

1840
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,240
benefit from this however

1841
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,280
the international rules based order

1842
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,440
offers predictability to nations that

1843
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,720
predictability

1844
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,000
is absolutely essential for nations to

1845
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,240
be able to interact with one another

1846
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,119
to be able to make sure that our trade

1847
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:12,240
moves because if

1848
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:14,480
if that international rules based order

1849
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,599
is undermined

1850
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,559
all our nations um uh have an impact and

1851
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,319
the last thing you want is to be able to

1852
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,200
put

1853
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,039
a nation put yourself in a situation

1854
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,319
like this right now we have two

1855
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:25,359
canadians that have been

1856
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,359
detained for over over two years but

1857
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,799
let's not forget other nations we're

1858
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,680
talking about 5g

1859
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,720
it's not just a decision moving forward

1860
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,880
nations have to look at what decisions

1861
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,559
were made in the past to making sure

1862
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,720
that their infrastructure is prepared

1863
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,799
for the future so i'll give you an

1864
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:43,839
example of this

1865
01:07:43,839 --> 01:07:47,280
so within cse um we and when it came to

1866
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,559
4g technology

1867
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,599
we worked very closely with

1868
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,559
the telecommunication sector to be able

1869
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,000
to take a look at what type of

1870
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,680
systems being were being placed across

1871
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,039
the country and especially in core

1872
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,559
areas and we have an extremely good idea

1873
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,000
exactly where

1874
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,079
uh uh and what is needed uh to move

1875
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:07,680
forward so our 4g

1876
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,880
infrastructure is very solid um and

1877
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,520
we've

1878
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,119
we have to make some minor changes and

1879
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,000
upgrades and working with the

1880
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,280
telecommunication companies and we're

1881
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,560
going to be strengthening that that as

1882
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,120
well

1883
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:20,560
so moving forward our 5g uh

1884
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:22,479
infrastructure will be just a stronger

1885
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:24,000
if not better cse now

1886
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,238
has is not just about adding resources

1887
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:27,040
and technology

1888
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,880
it has greater authorities so for

1889
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,399
example we have defensive cyber

1890
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:31,679
authorities who have offensive

1891
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,679
cyber authorities and that provides a

1892
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:35,520
lot of deterrence and we work together

1893
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,439
with allied nations already

1894
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:42,000
in calling out nefarious cyber

1895
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,120
attacks but one thing is

1896
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:48,158
absolutely certain here moving forward

1897
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,880
how do we prevent the problem that we're

1898
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,799
talking about right now

1899
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,679
which is we should be investing now in

1900
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,600
6e technology

1901
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,920
and so rather than being in a position

1902
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,399
where we're talking about

1903
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,719
with 5g technology and how do we get

1904
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,399
here and and and an

1905
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,198
other nation has uh type of equipment

1906
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:09,839
and coercive

1907
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,839
uh authorities and what they're doing in

1908
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,120
our nations could be

1909
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,920
uh extremely disrupted to our nation's

1910
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:16,960
moving to the future

1911
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,719
we need to start investing in the 6g

1912
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,040
technology now so that we're not put in

1913
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,319
these type of situation

1914
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,960
and that is absolutely uh uh critical

1915
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:25,600
here

1916
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,839
what that also demonstrates to us is

1917
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,279
that we will not allow

1918
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,080
nations uh to be able to take hold uh

1919
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,198
and and use leverage over smaller

1920
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,399
nations as well so moving forward we

1921
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,679
we need to be able to work together u.s

1922
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,679
ex what's happened in the u.s should be

1923
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:47,759
an example for the rest of the world

1924
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,479
on what we need to uh prevent and take

1925
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:51,520
those concerns

1926
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:56,239
very seriously oh two two questions um

1927
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,280
is canada already working on 6g and how

1928
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:01,360
fast would my phone go if that

1929
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:04,719
existed and and when you say what

1930
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:05,679
happened in the u.s

1931
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,440
doesn't happen again which aspect of

1932
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,480
what happened in the u.s

1933
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,360
i would say when it came when it comes

1934
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,360
to 5g technology

1935
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,199
they too have uh uh making a decision to

1936
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,600
say that we don't want a certain company

1937
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,360
doesn't make you safe you have to take a

1938
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,199
look at what infrastructure decision has

1939
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:26,480
already been made

1940
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,280
and and so for example certain systems

1941
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,640
need to be potentially ripped out to

1942
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,920
making sure that systems

1943
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,560
are safe but also at the same time this

1944
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,560
is not just about one nation or one

1945
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,280
company

1946
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,400
this is about making sure that any time

1947
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,159
you put any technology into core

1948
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:46,159
systems i'm talking about there's cyber

1949
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,800
here that it's it's well protected

1950
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,080
you can say that well we'll pick uh com

1951
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,120
uh company x because company y uh is

1952
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,120
part of a a different nation well

1953
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,520
company x may not have the expertise

1954
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,520
to be a cyber safe and could be easily

1955
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,560
hacked

1956
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,360
so we have to be very mindful of the

1957
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,199
decisions that we make so

1958
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,120
working together collaboratively it goes

1959
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,800
back to their previous discussion that

1960
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,760
we had on

1961
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,880
sharing on innovation

1962
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,880
with trusted partners is very important

1963
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,239
one thing i can assure you in addition

1964
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,000
to working as part of nato

1965
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,159
canada works bilaterally with many

1966
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,360
european nations

1967
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,520
on security issues and developing these

1968
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:26,960
things so when it comes to research

1969
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,800
on 6g technology i don't even know what

1970
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,400
66 technology will be

1971
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,920
but let's put it this way we didn't know

1972
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,760
what artificial intelligence

1973
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:36,800
uh or machine learning was but

1974
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,120
we invested in canada a long time ago in

1975
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,360
this that has developed the algorithms

1976
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,320
that led to

1977
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,920
a lot of the great innovation but then

1978
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,640
uh so the question that we really have

1979
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,320
to ask ourselves where is technology

1980
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,040
going

1981
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,960
where do we need to go so that it's a

1982
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,080
better meant for

1983
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,719
our all our citizens better for trade

1984
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,400
but at the same time

1985
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,679
prevent and uh as as my colleagues had

1986
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:02,560
stated earlier

1987
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,560
we need to make sure that we as nations

1988
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,840
come together and have the right

1989
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:07,679
regulations in place

1990
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,760
so that nations don't use it as

1991
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,280
disruptive technologies

1992
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,480
to use leverage over to other nations so

1993
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:15,920
um you heard it here first

1994
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:17,600
members of industry who are attending

1995
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,280
globe sec one of the things nato is

1996
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:19,760
going to want

1997
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,800
in the future is 6g get on it

1998
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,320
so um i'd like to get um go to a very

1999
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,199
provocative

2000
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:30,880
question um that has come in on the app

2001
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,440
from someone who identifies themselves

2002
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:34,840
only as

2003
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:38,400
s what steps can nato take

2004
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,159
if russia decides to annex belarus

2005
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:45,360
and and my corollary to that is what do

2006
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,880
you think

2007
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,360
of the biden putin summit outcome was

2008
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,600
this an unnecessary reward to putin or

2009
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,199
will it serve to check

2010
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:56,159
malign activity

2011
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:00,799
so minister nadya okay

2012
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,520
difficult to say if russia decides to

2013
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,880
annex belarus

2014
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,960
um i don't think nato should

2015
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,560
you know object

2016
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,159
um

2017
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,199
in a similar way that uh it objected uh

2018
01:13:21,199 --> 01:13:24,000
when uh when russia uh announced uh

2019
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,520
crimea

2020
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,440
uh because you know the situation of

2021
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,120
ukraine and belarus

2022
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,679
vis-a-vis nato is completely different

2023
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:32,159
uh

2024
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,960
on one hand uh it is uh you know it is

2025
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:35,679
if it is

2026
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:39,600
illegal annexation uh obviously united

2027
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,120
nations and other international

2028
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,800
organizations including uh

2029
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,480
including uh eu or nato should you know

2030
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,480
communicate that this is illegal

2031
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,679
annexation

2032
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,400
but uh i don't expect uh and i don't see

2033
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,600
any will of

2034
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,960
belarus to to come closer to nato or

2035
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,480
european union countries

2036
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,719
on contrary it comes very close to

2037
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:01,760
russia

2038
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,520
especially in in recent months uh

2039
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,520
and with a situation like hijacking the

2040
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,440
plane you know

2041
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,800
uh belarus is

2042
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,960
eleven even it's very non-standard

2043
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,440
position of somebody in between uh nato

2044
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,040
or european union and russia

2045
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,000
it comes closer to authoritarian uh

2046
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,360
countries uh

2047
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,719
and i don't i don't see any any uh

2048
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,960
light in the end of tunnel uh

2049
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:34,000
discussion between biden and putin was i

2050
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,560
think

2051
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,600
as expected no surprises

2052
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,440
uh maybe i was a little bit surprised

2053
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,159
this is my personal opinion that uh

2054
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:44,239
president biden was uh

2055
01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:46,719
uh after this meeting during the press

2056
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:48,719
conference a little

2057
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,080
more tough uh than i expected him to be

2058
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,199
uh which is uh good uh which was a good

2059
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,960
signal uh for me

2060
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,199
especially after for me surprising

2061
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,080
decision of

2062
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,199
biden's uh uh administration to to give

2063
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,400
a green light on uh

2064
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,480
nordstrom 2. um you know this was uh

2065
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,320
for me it was uh uh rather surprising

2066
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,560
even though uh some people said it was

2067
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,480
that we should expect that uh because

2068
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,840
you know the pressure from germany was

2069
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:19,040
very high and

2070
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,960
and president biden didn't want to uh

2071
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,840
don't want to

2072
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,520
um question their relationship with uh

2073
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,520
with germany on this issue but

2074
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,000
uh nevertheless for countries like

2075
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,239
ukraine and countries like slovakia

2076
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:36,480
uh this uh this north stream program is

2077
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:39,839
our project this something

2078
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,320
though if the green party wins in

2079
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,239
germany they say they're going to pull

2080
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,159
out of it even though they have to pay

2081
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:48,320
cancelled contract costs so before the

2082
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:50,000
election right let's see what they do

2083
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,040
afterwards

2084
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:56,000
um honestly saying

2085
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
this meeting was important for the

2086
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,159
strategic stability it was important

2087
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:01,840
for the signals towards russia it was

2088
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,840
important uh

2089
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,760
and more meetings these two gentlemen

2090
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:06,960
have better

2091
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,520
uh on the other hand uh i think the only

2092
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:10,239
thing that

2093
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,800
putin is listening to is a strong word

2094
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:13,920
and strong action

2095
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,880
uh angela merkel knows that uh she was

2096
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,840
able to

2097
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,280
to show the way how to deal with

2098
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,280
president putin uh previously and i

2099
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,800
believe that uh

2100
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,199
president biden uh with getting some

2101
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:26,640
experience in his new

2102
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,560
occupation uh he will follow this uh

2103
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,400
i would say more strict uh

2104
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,640
way of communication thank you and

2105
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,840
action

2106
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:41,199
minister sergeant if faced with um

2107
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:45,280
the issue uh with belarus

2108
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:49,840
what would you be urging

2109
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:52,239
well first of all what's happening in

2110
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,080
belarus is uh

2111
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,719
we've been very clear with our allies on

2112
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:57,760
this it's quite

2113
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:00,560
unacceptable but at the end of the day

2114
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,000
it comes down

2115
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,960
to what is the will of the people of

2116
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,400
belarus

2117
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,600
um it's what they want to decide where

2118
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,400
they want to go

2119
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,080
if they choose to be closer to russia

2120
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:18,320
it is their right to do so if they don't

2121
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:21,760
um and there is greater aggression

2122
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:25,600
it is up to us as uh nato allies to be

2123
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,719
able to express that

2124
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,800
as we uh have been

2125
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,159
thank you um and

2126
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:37,600
minister sakarinska from all the black

2127
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,760
swan scenarios i don't think that

2128
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,040
this is the the ones we should focus

2129
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,400
because uh why annex

2130
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,159
a country where you have such an

2131
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,000
overwhelming influence

2132
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,960
it's always uh much much smarter to keep

2133
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,159
that extra voice

2134
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:56,159
in the different in the different rooms

2135
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:58,000
but it could be a communication

2136
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,560
opportunity for nato if this is how you

2137
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:01,520
treat

2138
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:03,360
if this is how russia would treat their

2139
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:05,120
allies

2140
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,679
what would you expect in the future from

2141
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,320
an alliance of that kind

2142
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,840
nevertheless i think that we should look

2143
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:13,600
at the the broader picture

2144
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,199
uh when analyzing russian moves uh uh i

2145
01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:19,280
i think that you will see a lot of

2146
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,640
rationality

2147
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,880
if there is one thing one sentence that

2148
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:23,840
i have still

2149
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:26,000
remembered from my history lessons many

2150
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,760
too many years ago

2151
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:30,239
it's an old uh statement by i think

2152
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,280
ulysses grant

2153
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:33,520
but don't quote me if i have made the

2154
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,199
mistake war

2155
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:38,080
is progressive which means that just as

2156
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,440
you think that you have

2157
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,280
learned your lessons from the previous

2158
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,520
world from the previous conflict

2159
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,199
you believe that you can replicate them

2160
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,560
that's utterly wrong

2161
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,159
because any opponent that is weaker

2162
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,640
in your domain will quickly shift to the

2163
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:53,440
other domain

2164
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,760
and this is what russia is doing you

2165
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,960
know when you when you see the

2166
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,840
overwhelming

2167
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:00,239
military power of of nato in many

2168
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,280
domains

2169
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,719
uh then they start doing this

2170
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,640
information and fake news and cyber

2171
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,360
attacks and

2172
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,480
it's cheaper it's quicker and

2173
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,880
it causes more damage than actually the

2174
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,400
the typical military move

2175
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,880
and we have in the balkans i i have seen

2176
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:15,440
uh at the

2177
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,600
at the first poll we did i see the i saw

2178
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,719
a lot of balkan

2179
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:21,679
uh references they they were small but

2180
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:23,040
if you take all of them together

2181
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:24,400
actually they were meaningful

2182
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,320
i think that we have seen these kinds of

2183
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,400
moves throughout the balkans

2184
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,040
very visibly and maybe uh when

2185
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:33,040
mentioning what has happened to the us

2186
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,800
years ago some of the trailers for this

2187
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,719
were visible in the balkans and maybe

2188
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,480
these small countries can sometimes be a

2189
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:40,960
good

2190
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,480
learning ground for the old established

2191
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,520
democracy what

2192
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,080
might happen if something goes wrong uh

2193
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:50,159
what we have seen throughout the balkans

2194
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:54,400
is a a a russian scenario in which they

2195
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:54,800
don't

2196
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,800
offer anything they just play on the

2197
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:58,880
weaknesses of the west

2198
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,000
uh when we first expressed our desire to

2199
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,080
move forward with nato after being

2200
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,199
elected

2201
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:06,639
for the first time in our history there

2202
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,280
was a strong message against it coming

2203
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:11,199
from moscow we were surprised

2204
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,440
we never actually had any communication

2205
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,239
with moscow

2206
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:17,840
public or or diplomatic on this uh

2207
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,400
they have really been very firm on

2208
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,320
saying that they will oppose our nato

2209
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:23,440
membership in

2210
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:26,480
various ways and what we have seen is

2211
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:28,719
that they have tried to undermine the

2212
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:29,679
agreement our

2213
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:32,400
agreement with greece everywhere they

2214
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,360
could

2215
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,159
greece had to expel several diplomats

2216
01:20:36,159 --> 01:20:36,880
because

2217
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,600
of their uh influence within the greek

2218
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,880
society

2219
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,199
we have seen less intervention within

2220
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,120
the macedonian society but still it was

2221
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,000
visible

2222
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,719
when we finally became a nato member and

2223
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:49,600
this was

2224
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,480
a war that they have lost they didn't

2225
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,040
waste

2226
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,280
time they switched immediately to the

2227
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,880
other goal eu

2228
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,480
undermining uh eu accession and sending

2229
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:01,760
this very strong

2230
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:03,920
message throughout the balkans and this

2231
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,480
is that the west cannot be trusted

2232
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,040
you know nato eu they're very different

2233
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,199
but you know when you attack them

2234
01:21:11,199 --> 01:21:13,920
you attack them to to the roots and this

2235
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,400
is what they have been successful i see

2236
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,880
many echoes in belgrade pristina

2237
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:19,920
sarajevo

2238
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,639
uh even podgorica from time to time look

2239
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:24,159
at north macedonia

2240
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,480
they have done incredible reforms they

2241
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,159
have come to an agreement with greece

2242
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:30,400
after three decades of disputes

2243
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,360
uh they have entered nato but look at

2244
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,639
the eu they're not

2245
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:36,320
they're not delivering on what was

2246
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,560
promised so why would belgrade and

2247
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,960
pristina be so focused on getting an

2248
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,400
agreement while

2249
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,280
there is no reliability and this has

2250
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,000
been

2251
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,960
really a message that was sent not only

2252
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,960
from moscow directly but especially

2253
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:51,600
through

2254
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,320
social media and the networks that have

2255
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,480
been leaning towards towards moscow

2256
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,679
and unlike the geopolitical game

2257
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:01,520
the visible geopolitical game that they

2258
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,679
have played which was unsuccessful

2259
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:05,600
this is actually where they're winning

2260
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,719
so allowing vacuum

2261
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,159
is opening the gates to a new type of uh

2262
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:14,560
warfare which is easier than the

2263
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,320
traditional one for which we have spent

2264
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,600
a lot of money and

2265
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,920
a lot of years of preparation thank you

2266
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,199
well it sounds like

2267
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:24,320
the best way to deter moscow is for nato

2268
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:28,080
to keep its word and do it as quickly as

2269
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,199
possible

2270
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,600
well this is this was the message uh

2271
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,600
that echoed throughout the balkans uh

2272
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,679
nato has kept its word

2273
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,440
uh when it comes to accession uh i i'm

2274
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,840
really uh satisfied that nato has kept

2275
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:42,560
its word

2276
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,120
on reiterating the open door policy even

2277
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,719
at at this summit

2278
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:49,040
i think that's very important i do

2279
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,159
believe that

2280
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,960
on the eu front there will be as the

2281
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,560
president of the commission said more of

2282
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,679
a geopolitical

2283
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:57,840
uh approach and when it comes to the

2284
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,520
balkans it's enlargement

2285
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,280
and that has been a recipe that has

2286
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,360
worked it has changed

2287
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,800
uh the the outlook for the continent and

2288
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,440
uh i think that the time has come to

2289
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,400
move forward

2290
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:14,080
thank you and with that um i'm going to

2291
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,760
thank the ministers for all of your

2292
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,760
input and invite you to join the

2293
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:18,800
audience

2294
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,880
and thank everyone for listening i

2295
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,560
i just wanted to add that one of the

2296
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,360
best ways

2297
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,920
for us to fight disinformation is to

2298
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:34,639
keep having

2299
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,800
amazing forums like this where people

2300
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,800
like me can ask tough questions of the

2301
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,000
people in charge

2302
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,440
and with that i'd like to turn over to

2303
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,320
my three and terry

2304
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:48,400
thank you very much for that and it was

2305
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,920
such an insightful conversation it's

2306
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,679
been an insightful conversation for

2307
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:52,719
three days

2308
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,960
but all good things have to come to an

2309
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,600
end as does globes act 2021

2310
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,960
sadly sadly indeed but i know we've had

2311
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:02,960
an opportunity to have conversations

2312
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,719
we've been able to interact in person

2313
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,480
and as well as virtually so thank you to

2314
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,520
everyone who came

2315
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,199
in person and to those who couldn't join

2316
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:11,440
us here thank you for joining us

2317
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,520
virtually i think one of the big

2318
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,719
takeaways for us

2319
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:17,120
as it is every year is the highlighting

2320
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,440
point that central europe is

2321
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,920
very very key as we redevelop these

2322
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:23,360
cross atlantic and

2323
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,280
ties as we go forward exactly there's

2324
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,679
been a big emphasis on reinvigorating

2325
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:29,760
the transatlantic relationship that has

2326
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,760
partly to do of course with joe biden

2327
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:32,639
making his first

2328
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:35,520
visit to europe as the u.s vice

2329
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,400
president but

2330
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:38,560
there's also a recognition of the at

2331
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,080
this conference at least of the

2332
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,400
importance of central europe as a

2333
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,280
partner

2334
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,840
in that relationship and on that subject

2335
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,960
i just want to point out

2336
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:48,639
something that one speaker said which i

2337
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:49,920
thought was very relevant for our

2338
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,280
discussions that we've had here over the

2339
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:52,000
past

2340
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,719
few days he said on that subject that

2341
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,080
it's not about the us

2342
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,800
doing something in central europe but

2343
01:24:58,800 --> 01:24:59,520
rather

2344
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,480
with central europe and with europe as a

2345
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,199
whole

2346
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:04,880
and i think that's highlighted across

2347
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,639
the board when you see the range of

2348
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:08,880
voices that we've heard from we've heard

2349
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,520
today for example from the ministers of

2350
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:12,080
defense

2351
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,719
from canada slovakia north macedonia

2352
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:16,400
even the deputy defense minister of

2353
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:17,280
japan

2354
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,760
we've had uh corporate voices here as

2355

01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:26,400
lots more voices and lots more sectors

2358
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,080
international institutions very well

2359
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,440
represented here of course from the

2360
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:30,400
european union

2361
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,880
we uh we had the vice president of the

2362
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,080
european union a couple of vice

2363
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,440
presidents over the past couple of days

2364
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:36,960
who also had the deputy secretary

2365
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:37,840
general

2366
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,719
of nato uh with us today offering his

2367
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:41,920
wisdom and insights

2368
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,280
we had seminal thinkers too um i mean

2369
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,800
everyone here of course is a thinker in

2370
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,480
one way or another but we had some

2371
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,920
people who really shaped our

2372
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,560
understanding of democracy of liberal

2373
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,600
democracy

2374
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,440
uh over the past couple of years uh just

2375
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,600
want to highlight ivan krastep

2376
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,880
who uh who of course is uh the the uh

2377
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:02,800
the light that faded i think is the

2378
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,320
title of his book which was so

2379
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,800
impactful neelam dio and tori tausig

2380
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:08,239
just among others

2381
01:26:08,239 --> 01:26:09,760
and i think it was really interesting to

2382
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,920
have a conversation with leonard

2383
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:14,639
volkov right after that biden putin

2384
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,480
summit and get his take on what he's

2385
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,120
seeing

2386
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,000
in dc where he was right now so amazing

2387
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,840
voices amazing thoughts i hope you've

2388
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,920
all gained quite a lot from these three

2389
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:24,400
days

2390
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,000
so i wanted to talk about where we

2391
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,480
started off from uh on tuesday

2392
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,719
we put up a slido and asked you for the

2393
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,120
three or four key words that you were

2394
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,199
hoping to get out of the three days and

2395
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,679
the the highlight points where climate

2396
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:40,480
security democracy post pandemic

2397
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,520
challenges

2398
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,320
so again look at look at the fact that

2399
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,239
you have the slider right now i would

2400
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:47,360
love to ask you

2401
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:49,040
actually terry asked them the question

2402
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,560
okay again we've got these

2403
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,880
these words in the word cloud and we

2404
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,000
asked you that at the beginning of the

2405
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,840
conference what you were thinking about

2406
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:58,000
we're going to come full circle now and

2407
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,920
ask you as we're closing

2408
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,800
what your main takeaways are from this

2409
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,040
conference if you could use your app

2410
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,120
if you've downloaded the app also those

2411
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,639
at home you can contribute to this as

2412
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:09,520
well

2413
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,159
pick up on one two maybe three words and

2414
01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:13,520
try to formulate

2415
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:16,480
an idea your main takeaways from this

2416
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,480
conference and uh we're beginning to get

2417
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,560
some we've got challenges there at the

2418
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,400
center networking hope

2419
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,159
okay from that i think we can begin to

2420
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,440
surmise what uh

2421
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,040
what came away what you're coming away

2422
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,560
with from this conference

2423
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,520
and i think unity hope challenges oh my

2424
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:32,239
networking

2425
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:34,719
i love that i mean that is the key part

2426
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,400
of doing a hybrid conference and being

2427
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,840
able to meet in person

2428
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,840
i think that is critical and as that

2429
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,679
builds i would like to

2430
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,560
acknowledge and thank um our organizers

2431
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,520
at globesac

2432
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,760
for making this possible making us feel

2433
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,719
safe as they did

2434
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:50,719
even last year in a smaller number so

2435
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:51,840
thank you very much

2436
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:55,280
for that let's see 6g has popped up

2437
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,040
60 indeed we're moving on from five

2438
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,960
moving along quite quickly indeed

2439
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:01,120
resilience still there hope still being

2440
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,600
strong we've got tech disruption

2441
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,840
um what else we got moving there climate

2442
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,600
security something that was beginning

2443
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:09,440
um that we heard a lot at the very

2444
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,600
beginning that has remained a theme

2445
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,679
european integration ew enlargement

2446
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:15,360
sustainable democracy

2447
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,000
sustainable democracy not just democracy

2448
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:18,719
well

2449
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,520
as that work cloud builds um and i know

2450
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:22,400
we will keep

2451
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,760
it on as we wrap up this show the one

2452
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:27,040
thing i'm going to say is

2453
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:30,000
i'm glad to see corporation hope and

2454
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:30,880
resilience

2455
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,120
up there loud and clear along with the

2456
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:34,239
networking

2457
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:37,040
um i think at this point we should wrap

2458
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:39,040
up because everyone has places to go

2459
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,440
people to see it's been a great pleasure

2460
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,080
for me to

2461
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,239
be with you as mc for both my three and

2462
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:45,920
myself uh it's been

2463
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,760
really really good i've learned a lot as

2464
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,360

2465
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,880

deliberations and

2468
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,400
without further ado i think we should

2469
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,679
give the floor to

2470
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,239
someone whom you all know at this point

2471
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:01,040
who's um

2472
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:03,360
with who without whom globe sec simply

2473
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,280
wouldn't exist we're talking about globe

2474
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,000

2482
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,360
all of you who came here to bratislava

2483
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:33,440
with all the travel restrictions some of

2484
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,000
you when

2486
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,480
to go to quarantine and you still came

2487
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:41,840
and it's so refreshing to see faces and

2488
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,920
humans and not only virtually through

2489
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:44,480
zoom

2490
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,320
everybody was just sick and tired of

2491
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,480
this one year of zoom calls

2492
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,480
from the morning to the evening and it's

2493
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,239
also refreshing to change

2494
01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:54,400
you know the home of his pyjamas to to

2495
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,080
suits actually

2496
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,400
uh we arranged a very good weather for

2497
01:29:58,400 --> 01:29:59,360
you as well

2498
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,480
uh here in bratislava so i really hope

2499
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:04,960
you all enjoyed uh the discussion and

2500
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,159
it's not a coincidence

2501
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,400
that the main word that came up was

2502
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,440
networking

2503
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,600
because that's what is it about you

2504
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,639
cannot build

2505
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:14,480
networks and friendships through zoom

2506
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,159
you can keep them it's a good as a

2507
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:17,280
crisis

2508
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,560
situation but the most important thing

2509
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:22,560
is that you're meeting in the corridors

2510
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,920
you're exchanging views

2511
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:25,760
and uh you're building friendships

2512
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:27,120
you're building business

2513
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:29,199
this is uh one of the most important

2514
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:31,360
things of the conference and when

2515
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,159
yaro said that it was one of his

2516
01:30:34,159 --> 01:30:35,600
toughest jobs to work

2517
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:38,080
for globe's sake i have to say that he's

2518
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,040
a fighter

2519
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,120

record in the last several years

2548
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,840

health uh

2561
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:26,719
actually based on our data 70 of

2562
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,280
you who came are already vaccinated

2563
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,040
which is tremendous

2564
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,440
absolutely absolutely great uh we made

2565
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:37,679

of science uh and other partners uh

2569
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,920
without whom this would be absolutely

2570
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:46,800
and absolutely

2571
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,239
impossible but we've in globsec went

2572
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:51,679
through very difficult uh

2573
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,040
time in the last year we had to scale

2574
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,480
down

2575
01:32:56,480 --> 01:33:00,639
our core team uh we lost some finances

2576
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:01,679
so it was a

2577
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:05,840
real struggling but we also use this

2578
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,800
opportunity to go out stronger from the

2579
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,440
crisis

2580
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:12,000
we had we have made a lot of measures

2581
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:12,800
internally

2582
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,159
we created a new board of directors

2583
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:18,560
who are here with us a new chairman of

2584
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,000

2588
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,760
to steer

2589
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,239
uh the globsec in the right way and also

2590
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:31,840
i would like to thank to our

2591
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:34,719
my uh old friend uh ambassador katria

2592
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:36,239
who always sometimes

2593
01:33:36,239 --> 01:33:38,320
comes to globsec and then he leaves for

2594
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,400
for some government position or

2595
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:42,320
ambassador but i'm sure that he will

2596
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:43,840
come back

2597
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,040
again most of all

2598
01:33:47,040 --> 01:33:49,679
i would like to thank to the great great

2599
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:50,800
team of globsec

2600
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,679
because without their belief it would be

2601
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:55,199
absolutely impossible

2602
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,840
i have to say that creating and

2603
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:00,320
organizing globsec in an environment

2604
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,159
where you don't know how the pandemic

2605
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,320
will look like when you cannot plan

2606
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:06,719
what will be a months ahead it's a

2607
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:07,679
tremendous

2608
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:10,800
uh challenge physically but also

2609
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,840
psychologically because you don't know

2610
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:15,600
you have so many moving things and

2611
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:17,040
moving targets

2612
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,520
and i have to say that we all took a

2613
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:20,719
risk

2614
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,040
that we will organize it we fixed the

2615
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,320
conference for june

2616
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,199
and i think we we we did the right thing

2617
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:28,239
but without

2618
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:31,280
their belief in what we are doing

2619
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,040
it would be impossible so i would like

2620
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,120
to thank to the core team

2621

2630

partnerships team i mean it's a

2631

month of work so thank you very much and

2632
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,480
i think you deserve

2633
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:15,839
a great applause

2634
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,440
so bratislava 2021 forum is coming to

2635
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,480
the end but

2636
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:23,280
it does not really stop us here because

2637
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:24,560
we are already kicking off the

2638
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,639
preparations for next year

2639
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:29,040
and we hope that we will not need to

2640
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:30,320
wear these masks

2641
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,239
it's so difficult to breathe in that and

2642
01:35:32,239 --> 01:35:34,239
i hope that we will be able to

2643
01:35:34,239 --> 01:35:37,679
fight kovid together uh and that we will

2644
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:39,280
not face more mutations

2645
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,199
and that the vaccination globally will

2646
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,119
will speed it up

2647
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:44,960
and for that we need international

2648
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,199
cooperation for that we need

2649
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:50,159
international solutions and places like

2650
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:51,040
this globsec

2651
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,800
are fostering it and putting also

2652
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,960
