you've been already told that

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,520

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
have to

36

uh cannot

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,119
cannot last beyond 60 minutes because

38
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,479
because we have another another session

39
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,479
coming up here five minutes later

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,560
with the prime minister of slovakia

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,319
chancellor of austria

42
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,360
and the deputy prime minister of czechia

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,560
so we will have to finish right on time

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
so um european defense corporation

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
uh you've seen the outline of the panel

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,640
let me just say that

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,920
i think the really pre three predominant

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
questions that we will

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,280
uh be you know going around i believe

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
number one it is the issue of the

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,160
relationship between the european union

52
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,959
uh and the um you know the instruments

53
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,080
of european

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160
union's defense corporation and nato

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
through these instruments i mean pascal

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,400
european defense fund

57
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,319
so uh in the past that relationship was

58
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,400
on occasion difficult is it still going

59
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,599
to be

60
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,400
is it still difficult how we can resolve

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
these

62
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
issues number two

63
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,720
uh there is a question about the

64
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,599
procurement uh you know

65
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,599
all of us you know i think

66
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
you know heard a lot of the frustration

67
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,560
here about the slowness of the

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
procurement process

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,599
uh you know do we have a way around that

70
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,799
will the procurement process uh remain

71
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,680
uh dynamic in the future and will the

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,200
instruments of european defense

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,959
corporations such as the european

74
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,080
defense fund

75
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,480
and european defense agency will they

76
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
help out with this process

77
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,080
and finally we have the question about

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,560
the

79
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
although we have issue really about the

80
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
future of european defense industry

81
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,879
are we capable of creating truly

82
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,480
pan-european

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,239
defense industry capable of competing

84
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
with the american and our defense

85
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
industries on the global stage

86
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,799
uh and if we are what is the role of the

87
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,319
smaller member states in it

88
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,920
will be you know the industries in the

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,599
smaller member states will they

90
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,879
just fold and they become disappear or

91
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,640
will they uh

92
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,798
become a part of a you know larger

93
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,120
defense project

94
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,000
now uh so i think these are the key

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
issues here

96
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,199
uh but i will have some targeted

97
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,040
questions for

98
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
uh for our speakers uh and as i

99
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,040
uh as i asked him my questions myself my

100
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,479
questions myself and you know please

101
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,520
think about yours

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,000
and you can you can raise your hand uh

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
and we can we can just do that here in

104
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,840
the room or you can just

105
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
use the app whichever way you prefer

106
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
so uh standing up with jan havranek

107
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
i think that i would like to start from

108
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,199
yourself and i will talk to you

109
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,560
i will move to marian

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,440
jan you've been working in close

111
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,199
cooperation with nato

112
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,320
for many many years you also have the

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,400
national experience and you have the eu

114
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,600
experience

115
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,639
so you've been witnessing firsthand you

116
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,199
know

117
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,680
the issues and problems which may appear

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,199
in the relationship between european

119
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,720
union and nato

120
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,880
uh in the last few years we have created

121
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
the you know permanent structure

122
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,039
cooperation european defense fund has it

123
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,000
helped out

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
or is it making cooperation with nato

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,919
more difficult

126
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,039
thank you marcin and uh good afternoon

127
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,880
to the audience here uh i'm a bit

128
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
perplexed because this is the first

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
event since 16 months actually that i'm

130
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,000
attending

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,400
life with such an audience so it's a

132
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,080
true privilege to be here

133
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,720
uh now to your question european defense

134
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
cooperation for me

135
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,000
is the key building block of

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
transatlantic security and defense

137
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
cooperation

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
for many years the united states have

139
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,800
asked the europeans to do more

140
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
in terms of developing capabilities

141
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
contributing more to operations

142
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
and so it is only natural that we

143
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
europeans as a part of the european

144
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,680
union but also in other formats we have

145
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
organized ourselves

146
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,520
and created tools and instruments to

147
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,919
contribute with specific capabilities

148
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,160
uh to the wider transatlantic security

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,199
architecture

150
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,639
so from my perspective pesco or other

151
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,400
instruments should not be making the

152
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,280
transatlantic cooperation more difficult

153
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,479
but i also have to say that we europeans

154
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,400
or members of the european union who are

155
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
also members of nato

156
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,160
have a special task to explain to those

157
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,520
who are not members of these

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
organizations

159
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
what it takes to be involved in these in

160
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
these structures and

161
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,600
in these initiatives and it really is an

162
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,440
internal stratcom effort

163
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
that we need to ensure the transparency

164
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,120
just by saying that these processes are

165
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,319
mutually

166
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,960
complementary and transparent we don't

167
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
make that transparency happen so we have

168
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,479
a special task in that respect

169
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
and i should also say that on the staff

170
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
to staff level already today the

171
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,120
cooperation

172
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
is is excellent i mean it has reached

173
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,520
its uh maximum potential so there's

174
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,960
always a need for more

175
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
political push if we want to see more

176
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,560
complementarity and more

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,400
uh output it's really up to the

178
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,479
politicians

179
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,919
thank you jan uh and if you think about

180
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,280
some follow-up questions

181
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
you know do let me know uh either

182
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
through the app or

183
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,280
you know just think about it right now

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,160
uh and

185
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
then we will come to the round of

186
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
questions uh now marian

187
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,680
uh i wanted to ask you specifically

188
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,919
specifically about slovakia

189
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,479
um well slovakia is this very

190
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,400
interesting case of a country which used

191
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,199
to be

192
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,199
a laggard with respect to defense

193
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,400
spending

194
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,120
but it is no longer the case uh in the

195
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,479
last few years you know

196
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
slovakia has ramped up uh its defense

197
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,800
spending so it's now at the level of

198
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
close to two percent of gdp

199
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,840
uh which is almost meeting the nato

200
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,199
recommendation

201
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,080
uh but there is this nagging question

202
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,919
whether this you know hike in defense

203
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,479
spending

204
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,039
is not related to this single purchase

205
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:05,599
of

206
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,720
um you know f-16

207
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
and will this continue in the years to

208
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,520
come

209
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,800
and kind of a loosely related question

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,639
to that when you look into the

211
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,560
european defense fund and you think

212
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,280
about the future of slovak defense

213
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,319
industry

214
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,000
do you think the slovak defense industry

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,759
will benefit from the european defense

216
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,800
fund or

217
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
is european defense fund more likely to

218
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,559
serve

219
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,479
bigger industries and bigger member

220
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,839
states

221
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,519
uh yes you're right we wish

222
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,159
f-16s could be cheaper uh but

223
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,120
this is not this is not the reality but

224
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,320
uh seriously

225
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,680
uh we are paying a lot uh for

226
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,000
for this project as it is the biggest

227
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,040
project uh

228
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
in the history of slovak uh monetization

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,399
uh

230
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,720
but at the same time it's not the only

231
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
uh it's not the only project

232
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
so but what what's uh

233
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,440
worrisome is uh it's not uh uh

234
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,480
to find the the the projects which are

235
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,440
needed uh

236
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
because there's a big gap of uh

237
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,959
modernization

238
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
from the past uh in in

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,959
the slower case uh what uh is much

240
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,480
harder is uh first

241
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,440
to make uh stability of the uh of the

242
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,560
defense budget

243
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,880
because uh yes it's it's nice to see two

244
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,680
percent

245
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
of gdp but still there's uh discussion

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
going on

247
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,240
and and and good ideas uh from

248
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920
from different uh different uh people uh

249
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,160
whether we don't need to or whether we

250
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,080
need to pay uh so much uh for the

251
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,360
defense and it uh and

252
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,720
and uh this uh securing uh defense

253
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,440
budget is still ongoing process that's

254
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,080
first

255
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
and second how to spend uh how to spend

256
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,959
uh the money once you have it

257
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,800
how to spend it in a proper and

258
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,000
effective manner uh

259
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,760
this is uh this is problem of

260
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,440
procurement law this problem of

261
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,160
very complicated processes uh especially

262
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
inside of the european union and this is

263
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,120
uh something we should we should work uh

264
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,079
work on uh because otherwise we will not

265
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,800
be

266
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
competitive to the countries like china

267
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
or like russia but also

268
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,959
uh compared to for example the united

269
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,160
states uh it's

270
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,399
it's much harder to acquire anything uh

271
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,160
in in european union

272
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,160
uh not only on national level and not

273
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,279
even speaking on

274
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,240
on some kind of uh international

275
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,279
multilateral

276
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,560
cooperation when it comes to edf

277
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,200
this could be very helpful uh and we see

278
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
it as a

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,279
as a good good tool

280
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,000
and uh and uh something which is uh very

281
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
promising uh for the future but at the

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,959
same time

283
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,920
uh it needs to be uh it's it needs to be

284
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,399
taken

285
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,000
uh off from all uh european countries as

286
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,040
european tool so we need to be sure and

287
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,920
uh

288
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,839
you are coming from poland and and you

289
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,200
know that very well

290
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,920
uh but it's not only about uh uh poland

291
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,560
it's also

292
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,360
uh it's also visible here that we need

293
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,839
to be

294
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,000
uh we need to be sure that it's not

295
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
helping only the

296
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
the big ones uh it's helping to the

297
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
smaller ones

298
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
including smaller uh defense entities uh

299
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,480
all over uh central europe for example

300
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,360
uh

301
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
so uh so this is what uh what

302
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
uh still needs to be uh still needs to

303
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,920
be discussed

304
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,920
how to how to manage but at the same

305
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,959
time

306
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
we need uh competitive uh projects

307
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,120
uh from these countries from companies

308
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,959
so the companies need to be active and

309
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,399
governments needs to

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,320
needs to help them thank you marion

311
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,079
now let me turn to our remotes

312
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,000
the tv speakers with whom we are

313
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
connected remotely

314
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,160
i would like to turn to jan olive lindt

315
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,200
he is the

316
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,639
state secretary from the swedish

317
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,480
ministry of defense

318
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,639
welcome sir and let me just

319
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,079
say that we are delighted to have you

320
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,079
here with us sweden

321
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,839
is a country which

322
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,720
which has a very large industrial

323
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,440
history

324
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,360
and which has very developed defense

325
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,200
industry

326
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,720
would you agree with the statement that

327
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,200
uh you know europeans are capable of

328
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,480
creating

329
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,959
a major pan-european defense industries

330
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,639
which can you know

331
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,240
freely uh successfully compete on the

332
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,519
global stage

333
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,079
well thank you very much and thank you

334
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,320
for inviting me to this conference

335
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,800
i'm sorry i couldn't be on site with my

336
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,240
colleagues

337
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,959
on this panel but i'm impressed how we

338
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:51,360
could

339
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,760
organize this well this is a very

340
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,839
important question and as you mentioned

341
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,720
we we have

342
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,920
a fairly large industrial base still

343
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,360
in sweden and i think

344
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
what we did a number of years ago was to

345
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,839
make it very competitive because because

346
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,000
we couldn't be the only one

347
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,760
uh offering them uh orders

348
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,639
uh so they had to be very competitive on

349
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,079
the international

350
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,920
arena this work started like some 25

351
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
years ago

352
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,200
the other thing that i would like to

353
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
mention is that

354
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,160
last december we we passed the bill

355
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,680
defence bill in our parliament which uh

356
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
meant that we increased our military

357
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,360
spending

358
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,600
uh by the largest amount since the

359
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,040
1960s so very much of the budget goes

360
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,639
to the orders for defense materials

361
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,519
science and technology but also to to

362
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,839
to build up our national uh defense

363
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,399
capabilities both on the military side

364
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,000
and on the civilian side i think when

365
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,360
it comes to a european perspective i

366
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,720
think there are some

367
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,839
uh key issues uh and i think uh

368
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,760
that my colleagues already mentioned

369
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,839
them that the one does not exclude the

370
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,560
other

371
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,279
we at the same same time as we build up

372
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,399
our european

373
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,079
uh capabilities defense industrial base

374
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,720
uh we do not we we can't exclude the

375
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,320
transatlantic link

376
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
uh from that we have to the one does not

377
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,880
exclude the other as i said

378
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,199
and i think that's for for many

379
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,800
different reasons

380
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,079
uh because we need the capabilities

381
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,959
not only produced in europe but also

382
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:41,360
from

383
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,920
from the other side of the atlantic

384
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,880
ocean

385
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,519
um i think there are many initiatives

386
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,480
right now that

387
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
that we could benefit from uh edf

388
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,040
is one of them it's a fairly new

389
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,839
initiative i think we have to learn from

390
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:58,399
it

391
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,560
we have some good experience from the

392
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,600
past

393
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,079
uh given my background within science

394
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,880
and technology that we were used to

395
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,120
a very competitive environment when it

396
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,800
come came to

397
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,160
funding from the european commission

398
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,959
but i think at the same time it's so

399
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,639
important to keep

400
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,920
uh the member states and their

401
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,600
uh will to to acquire perhaps different

402
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,639
systems

403
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,920
it's not to look into a system

404
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,839
with a single source industry that could

405
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,560
provide everybody with the same product

406
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,519
or system i think competition is so

407
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,560
vital

408
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,160
uh in these days because that will drive

409
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,519
us into new systems

410
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,959
new innovation that is so much

411
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,079
needed so i think for us

412
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,600
it's it's to deal with uh our uh

413
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,560
industrial base to promote it and i know

414
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,519
we have uh

415
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,720
such good cooperation uh both uh

416
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,639
with the the slovak republic and the

417
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,000
czech republic but also

418
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,040
with poland and other nations and i

419
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,399
think that's the key

420
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,600
for us to be able to develop together

421
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,639
uh the systems we need for the future uh

422
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,920
i think i stopped there for the moment

423
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,360
thank you

424
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,360
that's a really interesting perspective

425
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,800
also from sweden

426
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
which i understand is involve industrial

427
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,320
cooperation especially with czechia

428
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
so let me just turn to the

429
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,079
representative of industry because we've

430
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,480
been speaking so far with the

431
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,920
representatives of national

432
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,839
administrations but let's

433
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,560
look into the other side of the coin

434
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,240
here

435
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,519
mr frank howe i would like to ask about

436
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,199
your perception

437
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
of these new european instruments

438
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,040
european defense

439
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,120
fund and the older one european defense

440
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,480
agencies

441
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,000
do you find the operation by existence

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
helpful to the industry and actually

443
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,760
meeting the needs

444
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,640
of the industry

445
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
thank you and thank you for the

446
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,079
invitation to this panel while i'm the

447
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,679
industrial exotic

448
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,240
on this panel i think all these european

449
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,319
initiatives

450
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,280
are heading into the right direction

451
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,559
while

452
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,000
i think we are much too slow

453
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,440
and we don't use the uh

454
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
the real firepower of the industry not

455
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,440
in the right

456
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,760
right manner we have a lack of

457
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,880
innovation

458
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,280
and if i look into the landscape and see

459
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
so many different

460
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,280
systems throughout europe that doesn't

461
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,200
make sense for me and if you go to

462
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
theater we all go

463
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,679
jointly out of the eu or nato into these

464
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,000
missions and everybody is wearing their

465
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,120
own boots their

466
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,000
own pistols their own weapon systems

467
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,640
their own

468
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
ammunition and i think it is

469
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,039
hard to be competitive against the rest

470
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,120
of the world if we stick to

471
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,320
so many different systems we have in use

472
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
and if you compare europe with the us so

473
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,120
with russia or china

474
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,720
i think we are pretty much far behind

475
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
and if i go to the to the land system

476
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,400
seeing

477
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
average age of main battle tanks

478
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
throughout europe 40 years

479
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,160
less than 50 percent have been developed

480
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
manufactured in europe

481
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,640
and if i go to the heavy artillery it's

482
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,760
only 12

483
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,440
of the systems have been developed and

484
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,360
manufactured in europe i think

485
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,880
there is a lot a lot of room to improve

486
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,559
for all of us

487
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,240
um to be at least competitive

488
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,280
and i think as long as we don't get the

489
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,080
right push

490
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,280
from from the member states

491
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,679
we will not change the game and if it

492
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,720
takes for instance 30 years

493
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,679
to develop new systems if i go for the

494
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:06,160
new

495
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,840
fighter for the fcas which will be there

496
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,720
2040 that's in

497
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,440
20 years from now i am gcs 2035

498
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,240
and going to the history of uh of

499
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,200
fighters

500
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,799
of transport aircrafts it doesn't make

501
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,160
sense that uh

502
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,360
we spend two three two degree

503
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,000
decay it gets to to to generate

504
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,360
something new i think

505
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,160
we don't have the right setup these days

506
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,480
we

507
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,679
are too egoistic

508
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,440
in every nation and we have to look for

509
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,840
more

510
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,760
joint then more

511
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,320
by whatever is available wherever it

512
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,600
comes from

513
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,039
thank you thank you sir so we

514
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,600
we heard three national perspectives

515
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,880
from slovakia

516
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,080
from czechia from sweden we have also

517
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,960
heard the perspective from industry so

518
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,760
the floor

519
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,520
is now available for yourself for your

520
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,840
questions this is something you

521
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,200
would like to hear further from

522
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,919
our two representatives here on the

523
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,120
stage and

524
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,919
the people who with whom we also connect

525
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,840
remotely

526
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,280
feel free to ask a question

527
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,919
and i i don't see takers at this point

528
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,280
in time so let me

529
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,640
ask uh you know everybody the question

530
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,760
uh and that gives you time to prepare

531
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,080
your

532
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,000
questions uh well uh

533
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,919
we've seen the latest pentagon proposal

534
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,960
for the defense budget which kind of

535
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,440
de-prioritizes traditional procurement

536
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,000
and emphasizes research and development

537
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,039
do you see a reflection of that

538
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,440
in your national budgets do you see a

539
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
reflection of that

540
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,679
in you know industries plans are you

541
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,120
considering you know

542
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,919
the application of the development of

543
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,120
you know

544
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,480
research and development in new

545
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
technologies uh

546
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,640
further investment in the issues of

547
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,799
artificial intelligence

548
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,240
uh sonic weapons microelectronics

549
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,799
perhaps you know the first person i

550
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,799
would like to ask about it is

551
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,080
is our representatives from industry

552
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,600
mr han

553
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
um i think i said it already i missed

554
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,919
the fire power i missed the speed

555
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,600
we are so slow and i don't see that

556
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,080
these

557
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,120
initiatives really plays a role as a

558
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,960
game changer i don't see this game

559
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,840
changing

560
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,559
well i see more or less two big programs

561
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,320
but they are not based on

562
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,240
nato or an eu this is a german french

563
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,520
initiative on on prepping for new

564
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,640
technologies

565
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,000
and i think again it we are too slow

566
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,559
technologies are changing i would say

567
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,280
sometimes

568
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,440
in some areas every year and we are

569
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,360
shooting for new weapon systems in 20

570
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,640
years

571
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,679
that doesn't match

572
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,120
thank you sir uh now let me uh ask mr

573
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,600
lind uh how about sweden is sweden uh

574
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,400
redefining

575
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
its uh defense procurement priorities

576
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,320
it relying similar to that of the

577
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,520
pentagon

578
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
or this is not happening yet

579
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,840
well i think it's when you look upon

580
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,919
research and technology and science and

581
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:38,960
technology

582
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
i think there are different reasons

583
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,480
because there is a strong push for that

584
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,080
in sweden

585
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,360
one being that you have to invest in in

586
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,320
r t in order to be a competent buyer and

587
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,360
that's what the industry is asking for

588
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,760
we are the ones that will set up the

589
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,880
requirements for

590
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,679
what the systems we need in the future

591
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,520
and that has to be based

592
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,480
uh among other things on on heavy

593
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,120
investment

594
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,880
in r t i think the help we could have

595
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,159
is to have uh come together

596
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,240
for example within the framework of the

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,360
edf

598
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,679
in order to push for more investment

599
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,280
in in r t because that will help us

600
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,240
uh in the future to speed up if you will

601
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,520
as frank if i may

602
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,480
call you that uh mention in his

603
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,840
intervention

604
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,799
uh the whole process but then again i

605
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,480
think we have to realize

606
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,360
that defense markets is not a perfect

607
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,159
market

608
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,960
but we do i think the eu has done a

609
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,159
great deal

610
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,440
of making it more competitive and i

611
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,240
think

612
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,559
i don't know whether we ever will reach

613
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,799
the stage where the defense market

614
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,919
will become a perfect market uh

615
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,480
like other markets but i think there are

616
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,520
many things that

617
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,960
are done in that context and for us

618
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,279
it has been so important to have a

619
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,520
competitive industry

620
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,120
in a for example european perspective

621
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,080
and i think when the government spends

622
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,200
money on

623
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,480
r t it's a different thing when industry

624
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,240
spends money on r t

625
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,559
and we have to go and look into the and

626
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,279
i i'm not aiming for that right now into

627
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:25,600
the

628
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,720
different trl levels uh because there is

629
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,000
a difference where

630
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,039
government is spending its money on r t

631
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,840
and where the industry is spending what

632
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,799
is important

633
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,840
is to come together to see that we have

634
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,360
a complete system for that

635
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,840
so yes in a sense we are going in that

636
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,880
direction as well

637
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,679
okay thank you uh i don't know whether

638
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,360
you gentlemen would like to volunteer

639
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,120
some response of this question or

640
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,720
or not necessarily i can i can touch

641
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,679
upon this

642
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,120
this question of r d

643
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,000
one of the commitments of of pesco is uh

644
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,640
is

645
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,279
to spend more uh to spend two percent of

646
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,159
of uh

647
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,400
not gdp but two percent of the defense

648
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,080
budgets for

649
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,720
uh for research and development and uh

650
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,640
and uh for example in case of slovakia

651
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,159
it's about i don't know ten

652
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
ten times less uh so so to get there is

653
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,440
uh

654
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,919
is a really big challenge uh for us but

655
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:24,720
uh

656
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,840
it's also uh another uh another problem

657
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,720
that uh

658
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,840
we are increasing uh the the

659
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,120
uh the budget uh devoted to for research

660
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,840
but

661
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,400
but uh we need to have uh partners on

662
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
the other side uh we need to have uh the

663
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,039
projects

664
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,799
which we can support this sometimes uh

665
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,720
sometimes problem at the same time i i

666
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,600
very much agree with uh mr hong who is

667
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,240
saying that

668
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
the whole processes are very small very

669
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,279
slow uh

670
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,320
because uh once you you can invest to

671
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,720
the

672
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,640
to the research or to development of

673
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,919
some product but uh

674
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,279
once you uh see that uh putting

675
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,440
or placing the product on the market uh

676
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,360
takes i don't know 10 years

677
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,320
uh then uh the appetite for investing uh

678
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,720
to

679
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,600
uh to this uh to this project uh or to

680
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,799
this product uh

681
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,279
is is uh decreasing so so it's

682
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,279
interconnection of uh

683
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,320
of the of the wheel and and the

684
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
money which is uh which is uh ready

685
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,600
but at the same time it's about the

686
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,279
whole cycle of uh of

687
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,720
uh defense production and uh sometimes i

688
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,799
i i feel that uh in case of european

689
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,320
union we are uh

690
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,559
we are uh creating all those type of

691
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,240
obstacles for ourselves

692
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
we are not helping and not boosting uh

693
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,840
to the

694
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,159
to the defense uh to the defense

695
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:50,960
industry but

696
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,039
we are sometimes creating or not

697
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,400
sometimes but very often

698
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,159
we are creating obstacles how to make it

699
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,760
more complicated for our

700
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,039
uh for ourselves so so this is where we

701
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,640
need to work uh

702
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,840
very much uh and as i as i said at the

703
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,640
very beginning

704
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,120
uh otherwise we will not be competitive

705
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,400
and and this is what

706
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,080
can make it troubles for us thank you

707
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,279
yeah i mean i i agree with

708
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,320
marianne uh but we have to realize

709
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
there's a paradigm shift happening and

710
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,240
that we need to broaden the definition

711
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,880
of the defense market or the defense

712
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,799
industry does not only equal defense

713
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:29,679
market

714
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,360
i mean traditionally the governments

715
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,200
would throw money into research and that

716
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,000
would be spin-offs for the civilian use

717
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,159
today we're seeing startups that produce

718
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,520
technologies that actually

719
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,640
impact the way we organize ourselves and

720
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,120
the way what the capabilities that get

721
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,760
employed

722
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,360
so i'd say we need to broaden that

723
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,279
definition and we need to have a genuine

724
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,440
dialogue public-private partnership

725
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,600
uh when it comes to innovation but i

726
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
agree we need to increase the spending

727
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,520
on on r t or r d

728
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,039
in our case it's 0.5 of the

729
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,760
uh two percent guideline a different

730
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,279
percent guideline

731
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,559
and certainly this is an area where

732
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,080
standards help

733
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,559
the european defense agency serves as a

734
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,480
good platform to organize

735
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,080
both the companies and and the member

736
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,159
states of the eu but there are also new

737
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,039
and good tools

738
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,000
uh emerging uh at the nato level where

739
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,760
uh research and innovation has been

740
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
parked and invisible to the member

741
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,080
states

742
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,159
for many years so that is that is now

743
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,840
changing and

744
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,399
agree we we need to cooperate more but

745
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,919
with that broadened perspective and a

746
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,720
new definition

747
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,559
thank you jan uh and thank you marion

748
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:41,919
now i've seen that we

749
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,559
have a question from the audience uh

750
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,159
matthew rhodes

751
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,720
the marshall center

752
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,399
not german marshall fund but marshall

753
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,640
center i'm always getting confused with

754
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,120
all right

755
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
yeah thank you margin and hello jan

756
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,600
hronic and marion meyer

757
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,679
since at least the 1990s there's always

758
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,440
been discussions about whether there can

759
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,360
be joint procurement or other defense

760
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,559
cooperation

761
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,399
bilaterally between the czech republic

762
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,399
and slovakia or at a regional level

763
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,039
through the v4 or other frameworks

764
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,960
how do you see the prospects for this

765
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,799
type of defense cooperation going

766
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,200
forward

767
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,960
maybe i'll start with this

768
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,080
it's a very targeted question i'm a big

769
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,559
fan

770
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,360
or i i used to be a big fan of of uh

771
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,919
join

772
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,200
joint procurement uh but uh until

773
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,360
uh i took the position of uh deputy

774
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,720
minister

775
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,080
uh i'm i'm seeing the things

776
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,279
more realistic i would say uh

777
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:44,960
i think it's very difficult to to

778
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,279
synchronize uh there is a political will

779
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:47,600
but

780
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,919
but it's very difficult to synchronize

781
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,120
the needs

782
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,840
the budget the money uh

783
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,840
some requests uh coming from uh from the

784
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,640
armed forces

785
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,840
because uh although we've got

786
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,880
uh very much in common uh

787
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,360
sometimes it's not so much in common uh

788
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,200
so it means that uh

789
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,320
the the uh czech soldier is asking

790
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,080
something else than uh than the slovak

791
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,120
soldier

792
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,679
and sometimes making uh the the process

793
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:20,559
more complicated

794
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,279
so so uh but it doesn't mean that we

795
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,640
need to resign on

796
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,559
on these i'm i'm just saying that we

797
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,080
need to be more realistic

798
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,200
there were big projects or big ideas of

799
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,320
the project in the past and we

800
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,360
uh we didn't succeed with them like

801
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,399
a procurement of 3d rudders maybe 10

802
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,600
years ago or 12 years ago

803
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,600
and and after uh next decade we

804
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,919
we decided to go on our own way although

805
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,000
very similar one

806
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,880
but there are some projects like for

807
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,200
example in the v4

808
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,039
procurement of ammunition hopefully

809
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,640
we'll get to

810
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,000
some real outcomes so i think

811
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
uh coming from bottom-up uh is

812
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,080
the better is the better uh solution in

813
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,880
this case

814
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,760
and uh and it's still about uh good

815
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,640
communication

816
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,880
uh on on the bilateral or multilateral

817
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,080
level and i think

818
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
with the czech republic we are able to

819
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,519
discuss very openly

820
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,519
uh but also with other countries in the

821
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,720
in the region but

822
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,679
uh to have the expectation that we are

823
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,440
going to procure

824
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,720
for example tracked vehicles now we are

825
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,279
in the

826
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,559
in the same process or similar process

827
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,000
we both need tracked vehicles as a part

828
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,240
of

829
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,080
fulfilling commitment to nato but uh

830
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,960
we were not able uh to uh to come up

831
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,399
with the joint solution

832
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,039
because of many uh different factors so

833
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,000
sometimes

834
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,480
we need to be realistic and uh and uh

835
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
maybe and not to

836
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,320
create like two two big expectations

837
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,720
thanks for this realistic assessment uh

838
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,360
you know um

839
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,720
and thank you matt for being a

840
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
persistent fan of visiograd defense

841
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,840
cooperation

842
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,760
uh to be honest we haven't cracked fully

843
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,000
the the formula we've been trying uh at

844
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,799
this forum

845
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,039
uh in in all sorts of formats and in

846
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,559
addition to to the conditions that

847
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,640
marian mentioned i'd also say

848
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
we need to be able to align our

849
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
strategic priorities and strategic

850
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,559
cultures

851
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,799
and one of the lessons learned from the

852
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,799
past six or seven years

853
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,279
is that uh the bishopra defense

854
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,640
cooperation format

855
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
has not been able to adjust to the

856
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
changing environment and changing

857
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,279
strategic priorities within nato and eu

858
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,960
we sort of got stuck in the smart

859
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,320
defense era of

860
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,640
10 to 12 years ago when we thought that

861
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,919
we can just you know

862
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,200
do less for well do more

863
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,679
for for less money and that we can

864
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,600
harmonize our acquisition plans and

865
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,880
miracle will happen

866
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,880
it has not happened and we are still

867
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,000
working together

868
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,799
uh to to to find the best and realistic

869
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,440
projects

870
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,880
and it doesn't have to be about

871
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,640
procurement i think we've uh aligned

872
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,399
ourselves in terms of training

873
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,720
the visual ground battle group has

874
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,760
served as a

875
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,159
useful tool for interoperability and

876
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,679
training and exercising and

877
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,200
standardization

878
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,039
uh but we can also look at the

879
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,559
requirements by nato

880
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,120
and see whether bishograath group can

881
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,080
can

882
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,720
provide some training capacities uh be

883
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,080
it uh

884
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,480
pilots uh you know all sorts of and we

885
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,240
can also join our forces uh

886
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,640
in out of uh area operations or

887
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,840
deployments abroad

888
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,960
so i'd say like marianne bear with us

889
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,480
we're still working on it i think we're

890
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,320
much more realistic than we were

891
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,399
10 years ago we still haven't cracked

892
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,600
the code

893
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,240
and it requires both political will uh

894
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,760
bureaucratic persistence

895
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,159
and perhaps also the the the military

896
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,240
and military attention uh

897
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,840
so you know to be continued thank you

898
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,000
but i understand if there is a will but

899
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,919
oh definitely yeah

900
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,080
otherwise we would not be sitting

901
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,240
exactly exactly that's that's

902
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,200
that's showing a lot let me move to some

903
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,600
uh

904
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,639
questions that we got uh on on the app

905
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,040
uh we have a question here from heidi

906
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,399
maurer

907
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,199
which you can read european countries

908
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,520
tried for decades unsuccessfully to

909
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,399
collaborate

910
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,918
in defense what is in your view the main

911
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,119
success ingredient why it will

912
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,918
work now and well let me take this

913
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,280
question straight to

914
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,560
um the representative of industry frank

915
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,000
howen

916
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,879
and then perhaps also like to ask um jan

917
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,800
olive lint for your views on on this

918
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,119
question

919
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,719
i got already a lot of nice hints

920
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,199
obstacles defense market standards and

921
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,359
synchronizing of needs

922
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,040
first of all i have to say the defense

923
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,000
market is not a european market so far

924
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,119
we are still have the the situation that

925
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:04,079
nations are asking for offset

926
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,440
requirements co-production requirements

927
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,720
and it's not an open market it's a still

928
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,920
a closed market pretty often you are

929
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,440
confronted with

930
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,560
national eyes only so

931
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,359
the defense market is regulated and

932
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,480
industry cannot

933
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,000
crack that wall the governments could

934
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,640
crack it

935
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,480
the governments have to design to make

936
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,040
cooperation between the nations much

937
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,000
smoother

938
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,599
and end up with more similar products

939
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,640
please we need a framework

940
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,160
at least within europe to

941
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,000
allow corporations open corporations not

942
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,079
closed corporations

943
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,000
and to exchange technologies even that's

944
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
an obstacle whether it's in the north or

945
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,599
south or east or west

946
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,480
technology extinct exchange is still

947
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,240
hardly regulated

948
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,480
and i don't like to talk about export

949
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,400
regulations they are totally different

950
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,119
as well

951
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,480
as long as we don't design a real

952
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,720
european defense market

953
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,119
my best guess is we end up in a city of

954
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,320
nowhere

955
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,000
and we are again through these

956
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,880
obstacles much too slow there is no real

957
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,640
european

958
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,440
defense market

959
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,520
thank you and jan olive lind would you

960
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,680
like to say a few words on

961
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,599
on this issue why whether we really

962
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,960
have uh overcome the obstacles and

963
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,599
whether

964
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,640
the success is likely to happen

965
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,880
well thank you very much first of all

966
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,800
could i offer a small comment on the

967
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,960
previous question that

968
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,800
when i look upon it from a nordic

969
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,160
perspective it's not

970
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,520
so easy always to cooperate between our

971
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,440
nordic neighbors with our nordic

972
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,960
neighbors so i think

973
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,680
uh that has to do with it with a number

974
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,119
of

975
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,119
questions even though we have a very

976
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,240
strong

977
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,040
uh framework agreement the nordefco

978
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,680
agreement

979
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,640
but uh there i think one has to take

980
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,640
into account the background

981
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,920
security of supply the security

982
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,079
policy of different nations for example

983
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,680
in the nordic countries

984
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,839
uh so i think that's that's a question

985
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,200
that is on the table

986
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,240
all the time and i think the progress

987
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,680
is being made as well well i think

988
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,800
we've been pretty successful given

989
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,920
what where we came from and i think

990
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,400
uh mr hound you know uh the swedish

991
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,839
industrial base

992
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,200
very well and you know what we are doing

993
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,720
uh i think that's a pretty strong case

994
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,119
uh for creating a very competitive

995
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,800
industry

996
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,280
uh and i think what we have today and i

997
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,720
fully share your view that

998
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,440
it's not only about the european market

999
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,119
it's about the global market

1000
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,400
as well uh so i think we are making

1001
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,599
uh progress uh the governments uh

1002
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,640
they most certainly have a stake in uh

1003
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,320
but i also think the

1004
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,280
industry itself has a stake in this as

1005
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,000
well

1006
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,480
to create necessary collaborative

1007
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,000
arrangements between

1008
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,359
uh different industries in order to to

1009
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:33,040
uh support a more competitive

1010
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,119
industrial market thank you

1011
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,040
thank you uh now um we i don't know over

1012
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,839
you gentlemen

1013
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,359
there's no need to respond to all the

1014
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,280
questions here because we have

1015
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,640
more questions you know uh asked uh

1016
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,280
and the next one uh is from nenate

1017
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,079
nejovic

1018
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,400
krnezevich they had me read it out

1019
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,040
given that the mana is already being set

1020
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,640
aside for nato

1021
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
will the new spending in pasco overload

1022
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,359
the budgets of the country so basically

1023
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:07,359
here the question is whether we do have

1024
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,160
a duplication already happening in terms

1025
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,440
of resources and

1026
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,000
yeah let me direct this question to you

1027
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,680
well i disagree with that

1028
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,079
definition of uh setting money aside for

1029
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:18,800
nato

1030
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,000
every every dollar every euro spent

1031
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
either nationally or within

1032
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,079
international cooperation

1033
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,960
projects is uh accounted for both nato

1034
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,000
defense spending

1035
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,040
and uh when spent on specific

1036
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,400
capabilities

1037
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,520
uh that money you know stays uh very

1038
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,000
often

1039
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,240
uh in the in in your own national uh

1040
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,280
national system so to say uh so uh

1041
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,359
there is no setting aside of money there

1042
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,720
is no uh

1043
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,640
there is no membership fee to be paid

1044
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,760
for nato uh

1045
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,240
and uh in in the similar way there is no

1046
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,000
membership fee to be paid for for

1047
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,560
pesco projects the money gets spent for

1048
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,520
specific

1049
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,440
capabilities on specific procurement

1050
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,040
projects or on specific operations

1051
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,599
what is important is that

1052
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,520
whether these capabilities are developed

1053
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,520
under pesco projects or

1054
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,640
nato nato cooperation they need to be

1055
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,280
available

1056
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,119
they need to be available when member

1057
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:21,119
states of these organizations decide to

1058
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:21,680
use

1059
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,560
those capabilities and deploy those for

1060
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,440
the benefit of

1061
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,520
nato collective defense of course and

1062
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,119
it's also important that uh

1063
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,599
third can countries or non-member states

1064
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,119
of the european union

1065
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,960
uh of nate non-member states of

1066
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,839
uh get access to to pasco projects and

1067
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:40,800
we've seen

1068
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,960
uh a success with the military mobility

1069
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,000
project having our

1070
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,119
north american allies and uh and norway

1071
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,319
joining uh that

1072
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,000
project which bears a significant

1073
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,160
political symbolism

1074
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,560
so let's you know move aside from the

1075
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,599
division of that

1076
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,000
of that resources after all all member

1077
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,119
states of nato

1078
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,599
and and eu should be operating on single

1079
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,119
set of forces

1080
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,280
and therefore the non-duplicity is

1081
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,800
embedded in their uh

1082
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,920
in the definition so basically you

1083
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,200
disagree with the premise of the

1084
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:11,760
question

1085
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,480
right i disagree yeah thank you maria

1086
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,520
would you like to add something

1087
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,160
i completely agree with uh with uh jana

1088
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,359
uh it's not either or uh question

1089
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,640
uh investing or or uh

1090
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,920
or investing into these initiatives so

1091
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,880
for us

1092
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,960
uh we need to for example for slovakia

1093
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,440
speaking on behalf of slovakia we are

1094
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,560
repeating everywhere

1095
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,520
uh on the european level as well that uh

1096
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,000
cornerstone of our security is nato

1097
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,240
uh i think it's the same for for czech

1098
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,359
republic

1099
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,599
and for poland uh but it doesn't mean

1100
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,480
that we

1101
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,359
we are not ready to invest uh

1102
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,400
financially or

1103
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,000
or in any other way into initiatives

1104
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,040
on the european level but uh because uh

1105
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,760
investing into european uh these uh

1106
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,000
defense initiatives means investing into

1107
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,119
into nato's capabilities so so it's

1108
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,240
very easy and uh and we just need to

1109
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,960
make sure that the we don't duplicate uh

1110
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,560
duplicate activities

1111
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,760
and and

1112
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,079
strategic review processes which are now

1113
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,280
going on

1114
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,319
preparation of strategic compass and at

1115
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,599
the same time

1116
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,760
preparation of strategic concept which

1117
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,800
will be

1118
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,920
which will be uh prepared very soon uh

1119
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,480
are a good uh you know good uh

1120
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,440
frameworks uh

1121
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,560
for uh for excluding these duplicities

1122
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,240
and making sure uh how

1123
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,720
how the things should be so also i think

1124
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,000
i also disagree with

1125
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,359
that uh notion of that uh question

1126
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,800
thank you uh now let me uh move

1127
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,839
to the uh next question which is being

1128
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,119
uh asked anonymously

1129
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,200
and it's referring to yesterday's

1130
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,720
decision of nato

1131
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,560
to create a defense innovation

1132
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,119
accelerator accelerator

1133
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,400
and nato innovation fund

1134
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,480
how do you think this is relating to the

1135
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,400
eu defense fund

1136
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,680
and the european defense agency

1137
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,720
so i hope you can see the question

1138
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,880
if not let me just repeat it yesterday

1139
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,160
nato agreed to create

1140
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,200
a defense innovation accelerator and

1141
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,480
a nato innovation fund how do panelists

1142
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,040
see

1143
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,079
that relating to the eu defense fund and

1144
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,760
the european defense

1145
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,200
agency uh i will ask our two

1146
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,359
speakers here with the in the audience

1147
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,440
in a moment but let me just start maybe

1148
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,079
with the

1149
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,160
um again with the representative of

1150
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,000
industry frank round

1151
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,599
uh from knds uh

1152
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,880
if you have comment to offer on that

1153
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,599
uh i think this is another pretty good

1154
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,800
initiative

1155
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,119
but i stick to what i said if

1156
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:04,160
governments don't

1157
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,280
create the right framework what is the

1158
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,839
value

1159
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,920
okay i understand thank you

1160
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,160
um well uh well sweden is not a nato

1161
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,760
member so i'm not quite sure that

1162
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,280
uh yeah and all of lindy would like to

1163
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,599
uh you know say anything on this matter

1164
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,119
but if you do do let us know in the

1165
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,079
meantime let me just

1166
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,680
pass floor to marion and uh jan

1167
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,920
i think this is this is in line what we

1168
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,800
just uh

1169
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,280
just said

1170
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,480
for me uh like debate about uh uh

1171
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,680
nato and eu to be the the same uh

1172
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,040
organizations is is is nonsense uh for

1173
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,599
to expect that both both organizations

1174
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,280
will do the same and and the outcome

1175
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,400
will be the same as

1176
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,440
uh is just out of reality

1177
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,880
so i mean uh that uh

1178
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,880
nato has its own processes uh yesterday

1179
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,280
the

1180
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,119
agenda 2030 uh focusing on innovations

1181
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,160
and focusing on on adjusting to the new

1182
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,880
security environment to new technologies

1183
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,280
have been

1184
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,680
have been presented and this goes in

1185
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,480
line with that

1186
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,839
uh so it means uh uh of course uh there

1187
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:22,160
are

1188
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,319
uh countries which are both in nato and

1189
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,160
eu but there are also countries

1190
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,400
like united states like uh like uh

1191
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,280
turkey

1192
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,160
uh like like norway which are out of the

1193
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,680
european union who are big

1194
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,200
investors who are big producers uh

1195
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,599
and investing a lot into research uh so

1196
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,960
it means that

1197
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,319
that uh i don't uh i don't see this

1198
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,040
as contradictory i see it as

1199
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,200
complementary and if

1200
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,720
of course it's the way uh how the the

1201
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,240
uh national states national members how

1202
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,640
how they manage the whole uh the whole

1203
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,640
uh situation and the whole initiatives

1204
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,680
so i think that

1205
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,480
it could be once uh it will be done in

1206
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,400
the proper way it could be very helpful

1207
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,640
for both organizations and for all uh

1208
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,480
member states

1209
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,680
thank you anza for many years nato has

1210
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,720
been seen as

1211
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,440
the golden standard for for a military

1212
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,560
standardization

1213
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,960
and uh by creating these these new

1214
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,839
instruments

1215
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:24,000
it's just recognizing that nato will

1216
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,920
continue to be that

1217
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,640
golden standard and it needs to be seen

1218
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,200
as

1219
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,599
another tool to foster innovation to

1220
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,560
help the allies

1221
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,760
identify and generate new technologies

1222
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,680
and transfer them into

1223
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,960
into nato's tasks and and core missions

1224
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,800
and european defense fund on the other

1225
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,760
hand is a is a financial mechanism

1226
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,280
uh common european funding funded by

1227
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,839
common european budget to help the

1228
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,599
european members to close certain

1229
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,119
capability gaps

1230
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,560
identified uh as a part of csdp ambition

1231
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,760
but again very much complementary to

1232
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,480
to to nato's mission in at least the

1233
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,760
czech and if i may say

1234
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,640
also slovak view and uh as marion said

1235
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,040
we

1236
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,319
what we need and it it's a task for for

1237
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,880
for all of us we need to avoid the

1238
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,880
institutional decoupling between nato

1239
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,240
and the european union

1240
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,480
the worst could happen is a competition

1241
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,720
between the strategic concept

1242
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,480
on the one hand and strategic compass on

1243
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,760
the other hand

1244
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,319
and it may be automatic to to to many of

1245
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,920
us here in the audience

1246
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,920
but as i said in the beginning we have a

1247
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,359
huge task

1248
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,280
internal strategic communications

1249
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,200
ensuring that transparency and mutual

1250
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,079
understanding about

1251
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,160
what it is that we're trying to do under

1252
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,440
these two very important processes

1253
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,839
excellent thank you and also very

1254
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,280
reassuring

1255
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,960
um well let me now turn to a question

1256
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,599
of our norwegian colleague colleague

1257
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,480
aslatoya

1258
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,760
there's a strong question which is what

1259
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:00,240
we can

1260
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,680
expect from asleep with nato pivot to

1261
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,960
asia

1262
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,760
will this create new room for europe on

1263
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,240
the

1264
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,760
defense procurement huh europe only

1265
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,520
defense procurement i'm assuming that

1266
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,720
ashley means

1267
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:20,000
europe not eu given where he's from

1268
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,079
so let me just uh take you straight to

1269
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,200
frank hound

1270
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,760
uh sir can you offer your thoughts on

1271
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,200
whether that would be a good idea to

1272
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:27,680
have a

1273
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,759
europe-only defense procurement

1274
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,599
uh i'm i'm pretty sure if i look in the

1275
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:36,960
capabilities

1276
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,000
of europe as of today

1277
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,760
um i think this will create new room

1278
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,480
um for for europe or for nato

1279
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,520
i i do not mix that up it's europe or

1280
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,480
nato

1281
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,240
finally but i think the capabilities

1282
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,119
taken as of today

1283
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:01,359
i don't think that europe is the right

1284
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:04,799
the right shape these days

1285
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:07,359
okay so you think that that's

1286
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,040
unrealistic at this point in time

1287
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:16,000
okay uh mr miss thank you mr linde

1288
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,079
uh do you also think this is unrealistic

1289
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,760
or this is you know

1290
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,160
it's kind of a long-term goal that

1291
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,119
europeans might

1292
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,200
want to have maybe not really speak

1293
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
about it openly at the conference but

1294
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,319
yeah well i don't know if i should

1295
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,040
comment on

1296
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,800
nato initiatives and pivots here

1297
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,440
uh but i think it's it's for us it's a

1298
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,559
global market

1299
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,000
uh that is absolutely key for us

1300
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,119
to to have it have in mind uh

1301
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,680
the european competence and the

1302
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,880
industrial base

1303
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,599
will absolutely be key but to create the

1304
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,200
european fortress

1305
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,079
is not what we are uh looking for in the

1306
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:56,960
future

1307
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,119
i think it's so important that we we

1308
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,200
should not compare with the u.s

1309
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,800
because that's a completely different

1310
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,960
market uh

1311
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,480
and supply chain but they are

1312
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,880
so important for us to have in our

1313
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,559
european minds

1314
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,359
when we try to create the most effective

1315
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,800
market for us

1316
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,240
and supply change i think we have to

1317
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,520
take into account

1318
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,720
what happens in asia as well

1319
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,839
and uh very carefully follow that uh to

1320
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:28,720
see how we

1321
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,480
have to relate to that in the future

1322
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,520
thank you yes can i can i just add that

1323
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,240
um first of all uh it's a bit

1324
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,280
far-fetched to

1325
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,760
to say that nato is pivoting to to asia

1326
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,559
if you read

1327
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,559
yesterday's communique adopted by the

1328
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:45,920
heads of state and government at the

1329
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,359
brussels summit

1330
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:50,319
you will see that nato is still a very

1331
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:52,640
euro-atlantic organization in its very

1332
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,359
nature

1333
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,200
it has just broadened its perspective

1334
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,200
and it now includes uh

1335
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,359
challenges and issues including uh

1336
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,200
chinese behavior

1337
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,400
uh in its uh wider perspective and how

1338
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,440
it uh

1339
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,440
sees the development of the security

1340
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,480
security and defense

1341
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,839
landscape including threats and

1342
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,480
challenges um and

1343
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,960
having said that it still doesn't take

1344
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,880
the responsibility from its member

1345
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,000
states

1346
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,160
uh to to build its own defenses and to

1347
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,559
to be preparing for collective defense

1348
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,800
and to cooperate in in crisis management

1349
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,160
operations

1350
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,440
on the contrary uh it requires uh

1351
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,000
us to do more uh and to take into

1352
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,880
account

1353
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,359
all different uh security developments

1354
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:38,000
including

1355
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
in the indo-pacific region but also in

1356
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,599
other domains

1357
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,839
so i don't i don't i'm i'm finding it

1358
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,920
difficult to to connect the

1359
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,040
uh wide-earning strategic perspective to

1360
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,119
the mechanisms of european procurement

1361
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,119
if i can be honest

1362
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:55,520
i understand but overall you don't think

1363
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,240
it would be a

1364
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,839
great idea to have a european

1365
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,000
procurement only

1366
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,760
i don't understand a question really

1367
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,440
that's that part of the question

1368
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,559
right um okay um

1369
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,359
let me just turn now to uh the question

1370
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,000
of

1371
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,880
uh justin lane

1372
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,000
[Music]

1373
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,359
the question here is quite perhaps

1374
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,720
technical but very interesting

1375
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,880
how concerned should the region be

1376
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,839
meaning

1377
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,640
i assume central europe will be

1378
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,240
increased brain drain of potential

1379
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,319
intellect intelligence analysts and

1380
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,319
artificial intelligence development

1381
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,200
talent

1382
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,040
moving overseas to regional defense

1383
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,480
um well let me

1384
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,760
take this one to mariana is not a

1385
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,839
problem only for a different sector it's

1386
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,359
a problem of

1387
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,559
of many other sectors and uh this is

1388
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:54,960
something which is big challenge for

1389
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,000
for countries of the region uh to create

1390
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,480
uh

1391
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,760
to create a good

1392
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,760
environment appropriate environment with

1393
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,599
uh with good financial

1394
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,400
uh conditions and everything uh what's

1395
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,040
connected

1396
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:12,880
with uh with uh conditions for a work

1397
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,440
so of course it's not it's not easy to

1398
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,559
keep

1399
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,359
to keep these talented people here

1400
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,040
our government is focusing also uh

1401
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,480
on this on this issue trying to invest

1402
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,079
into the education

1403
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,680
into uh some other uh other

1404
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,160
mechanisms that could be helpful uh to

1405
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,680
keep the people here but

1406
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,000
uh but of course it's uh it's a matter

1407
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,520
of market

1408
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,480
once there is more attraction from

1409
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,119
outside

1410
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,200
it's very difficult to to keep the

1411
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,400
people

1412
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,680
to keep the people here our our

1413
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,720
goal is to uh

1414
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,079
to uh produce the new generation i would

1415
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:58,480
say

1416
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,920
uh of uh of uh professionals

1417
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,319
uh because this is something uh new

1418
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,440
technologies

1419
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,520
new new initiatives new

1420
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:12,800
new kind of new kind of stuff which

1421
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,079
is related to uh defense of the future

1422
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,119
uh this is something completely new uh

1423
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,319
and uh and we need we need the new

1424
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,599
generation of the people who uh from the

1425
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,640
very beginning

1426
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,559
could be somehow more stick to uh to uh

1427
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,359
these national regional uh industries

1428
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:33,920
and

1429
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,400
and frameworks uh so very very difficult

1430
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,079
question a very difficult question

1431
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,119
because it's not uh the

1432
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,160
question for uh one country only

1433
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,040
or for one region only it's a very

1434
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,319
global i would say

1435
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,359
uh problem and and it's not only related

1436
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,160
as i said

1437
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,559
to defense uh sector although it could

1438
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:55,359
have

1439
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,920
in this case it could have uh some

1440
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,559
security consequences

1441
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:04,240
uh well maybe i just like ask a quick

1442
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,119
follow-up to

1443
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,040
frank hound if you see this kind of the

1444
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,920
problem with a cry acquiring talent in

1445
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,200
europe altogether

1446
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,440
and best talents migrating away from

1447
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,240
europe

1448
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,760
to the united states or even china

1449
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,799
i have no fear about china i fear if

1450
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,960
about the us but i think europe is such

1451
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,240
a nice area

1452
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,079
lots of people want to live in we are

1453
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,559
such a nice area and we have to fight

1454
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:36,559
for the talents yes and

1455
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,040
i'm pretty sure that if we don't like to

1456
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,960
lose them we will not lose them and we

1457
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,440
will create always an environment where

1458
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:43,839
they

1459
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,680
feel comfortable with my biggest concern

1460
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,680
is not the brain drain

1461
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,240
my biggest concern and i stick to it is

1462
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,520
the framework

1463
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,640
given to the industry

1464
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,160
okay thank you well

1465
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,200
we are running short of time but

1466
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,839
i would like to ask still one question

1467
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,359
from the list

1468
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:10,960
that we have here from the audience uh

1469
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,520
how do you evaluate threats related

1470
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:14,559
related

1471
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,119
to intellectual property being acquired

1472
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:18,319
by companies

1473
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:21,280
linked to the states like china

1474
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,079
especially

1475
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,839
within critical infrastructure

1476
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,160
so well with that

1477
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:33,280
uh again perhaps i will start

1478
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,040
from frank hound uh and then perhaps we

1479
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:37,359
will

1480
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:39,599
turn to the audience to be to our two

1481
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,319
panels here

1482
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,760
uh that's a real real

1483
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,799
big threat and uh we

1484
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,119
all within the defense industry have

1485
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,720
been attacked

1486
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,920
and we know how complicated it is to

1487
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,240
protect ourselves against these threats

1488
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,319
and to at least let our employees

1489
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:05,680
participate

1490
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,160
in the electronic world there are days

1491
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,480
and weeks and sometimes months where we

1492
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,440
have to isolate the company 100

1493
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,280
to make sure that nothing

1494
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,480
is stolen that's that's one of the

1495
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,799
biggest the cyber issue on industry is

1496
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,079
one of the real

1497
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,280
big issues we are dealing with and this

1498
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:27,920
is

1499
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,440
really highly expensive because the

1500
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,079
attacks

1501
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:36,240
are real and not in theory

1502
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:40,160
and we are we are more than warned and

1503
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,480
we

1504
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,799
take care and this absorbs a lot of

1505
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:43,920
money i would love to

1506
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,680
invest in our r t activities

1507
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:50,880
thank you sir uh jan if you can very

1508
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,720
quickly uh thanks for this excellent

1509
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,480
question it's a serious problem

1510
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,720
uh the czech government recently adopted

1511
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,880
not only a strategy to counter hybrid

1512
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,720
interference and we count this kind of

1513
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,720
behavior as a hybrid interference

1514
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,760
but we also adopted a lot for screening

1515
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,000
of foreign investment but i should also

1516
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:08,799
say that it's

1517
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,319
not only an issue for the critical

1518
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:12,160
infrastructure but we should be also

1519
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,119
looking at uh

1520
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,280
startups and and new companies that work

1521
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,920
in the emerging disruptive technology

1522
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,160
uh part of the part of the market

1523
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,400
because they are very vulnerable

1524
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,160
perhaps even more than than some of the

1525
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,640
critical infrastructure companies

1526
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,200
excellent thank you uh i think we came

1527
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,400
to the end of the panel

1528
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,839
uh and i would like to thank our all our

1529
00:58:33,839 --> 00:58:34,720
speakers

1530
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,319
i think that there are perhaps three

1531
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:37,760
conclusions we can take

1532
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,319
away with us number one from what we

1533
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,440
heard is that

1534
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,880
uh indeed uh you know both eu and

1535
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,400
uh nato are uh developing their own you

1536
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:48,960
know

1537
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,400
defense mechanisms but there is not

1538
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,720
necessarily the need of duplication here

1539
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,119
just uh uh you know there is a lot of

1540
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,040
complementarity here

1541
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,000
uh and uh there is no need to think

1542
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,359
about you know duplication

1543
00:59:01,359 --> 00:59:04,079
indeed and thank you for visualization

1544
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,680
we have heard some

1545
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,160
uh very interesting you know take on

1546
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,160
relationship with uh with china

1547
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,240
and uh as well as pivot to uh to asia

1548
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,200
uh and uh i think that this will be an

1549
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,559
increasing uh

1550
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,720
problem you know the the issue of

1551
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,559
property rights this is a

1552
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,960
a question for defense industry which

1553
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,559
increasingly will become

1554
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,040
uh troublesome i guess and finally there

1555
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,400
was we had very

1556
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,119
interesting exchange on uh you know the

1557
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,640
procurement cooperation

1558
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,680
between two neighboring nations but even

1559
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,119
within the vicia grad group obviously we

1560
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,040
heard a very realistic assessment that

1561
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,880
there is a will but you know when it

1562
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,079
comes down to

1563
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:47,839
the implementation it can become very

1564
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,760
difficult but it's very good that there

1565
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,799
is a will there

1566
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,200
so uh with that let me just conclude

1567
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,200
that can i just ask everyone to thank

1568
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,640
our speakers

1569
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,839
thank you
