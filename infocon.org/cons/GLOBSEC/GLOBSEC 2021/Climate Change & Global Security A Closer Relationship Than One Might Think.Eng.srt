of climate and security

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,759
if you've paid attention to many of the

21
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,799
agendas

22
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,079
at multilateral institutions at

many defense departments around the

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
world the

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,479
increasing intersection between climate

26
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
and national security and international

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,320
cooperation is becoming ever more

28
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,200
apparent

alexander i'm going to go ahead and turn

54
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,080
it right to you because

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
we just had a very important meeting

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
last weekend of g7 leaders

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,519
in cornwall and i noticed that you wrote

58
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,319
something

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,920
and you mentioned that you were

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,599
disappointed in a way

61
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
in the climate outcomes of that

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,879
particular meeting

63
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,720
can you expand on that a little bit and

64
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
to tell us what would you have

65
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,920
what you would have liked to see

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
especially in terms of the intersection

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,760
of climate and security at the g7

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,640
yes i think the essence of what i wrote

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,360
is that

70
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,400
g7 ended up with lots of of good

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,159
intentions

72
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,560
things you can't disagree with speaking

73
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
about moving towards a green economy

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,080
and help poor countries and those kind

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
of good intentions intentions i

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,319
i only missed the thoughts and prayers

77
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:19,920
but what you really need

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,040
is very clear time frames of of phasing

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,840
out

80
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,760
fossil fuels and and and the financing

81
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,080
to

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
to back all these ambitions so what they

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,000
have now

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
is a commitment to end the financing

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,519
of um overseas investment of coal

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,440
but if you listen to the international

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,319
energy agency and that is not

88
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,239
um some kind of of activistic um

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,959
green organization this used to be until

90
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,959
very recently the darling of the fossil

91
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,560
fuel industry

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
they say we should end all investments

93
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,159
in all

94
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,360
fossil fuel projects not only coal so

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,959
it's um it's too little and too late

96
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,319
and and we need much higher ambitions

97
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,319
and and treat um this emergency

98
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,360
as an emergency and not as some kind of

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,199
new policy we should work on in the

100
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,120
years to come

101
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,839
absolutely i'm gonna ask kate to expand

102
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
on that but before i do i realized that

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,880
at the beginning i forgot to let

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,759
everyone know

105
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,240
that we are using slido for questions so

106
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,919
if you have questions that you'd like to

107
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,240
to ask the panelists um you can either

108
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,919
do that at the microphone when we get to

109
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,840
the q a section or ask on slido so

110
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,880
wanted to make sure

111
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,120
we had that uh point of order before we

112
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,240
go ahead and dive in

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,720
um kate coming to you will you expand a

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,479
little bit on what alexander

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,280
uh was saying about about this meeting

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,080
and

117
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
um to expand it a little bit i mean the

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
role of multinational institutions like

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,440
the eu like nato

120
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,040
when it comes to when it comes to

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,280
climate and international security i

122
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,840
mean

123
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,240
there's obviously a role there what is

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,960
it and

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
how can international or different

126
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,720
countries that might have

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,080
different approaches to climate

128
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,759
different goals how does that sort of

129
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,960
manifest itself

130
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,039
in these multinational institutions yeah

131
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,280
so it's it's a great segue from what

132
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
alexander was just saying because he was

133
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,840
speaking about

134
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,479
the urgent need to mitigate to make

135
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,680
stronger commitments

136
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,039
to do something about the climate

137
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,600
problem and unfortunately we've sort of

138
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,479
left it go

139
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,039
so far that now the doing something is

140
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,000
increasingly

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
security actors having to do something

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,600
about the problem because we're seeing

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
more and more climate destabilization

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,400
lead to the destabilization of

145
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,960
local environments and places with

146
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
histories and legacies of conflict

147
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,520
around the world

148
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,759
and unfortunately the the longer we wait

149
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,960
to do something about the climate

150
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,400
problem the worst we know

151
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,240
these futures become there's

152
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,080
increasingly incredible

153
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,039
uh analysis done by by groups like mine

154
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,800
the center for climate security adelphi

155
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,960
with uh johnny and others around the

156
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,080
world looking at

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,520
how bad things get even at just

158
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
a half a degree more of warming the

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,520
security consequences of that

160
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,759
are are sort of out of control let alone

161
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,440
the trajectory that we're on

162
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,400
so the exciting thing i guess is that

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,840
you have increasingly

164
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,479
ministry of defense political leaders

165
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:18,960
and

166
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,039
uh like the alliance earlier this week

167
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,880
understanding that these are security

168
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,560
problems that need to be central to

169
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,919
security strategies

170
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,840
that is quite new right uh we've been

171
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,440
sort of banging on about the

172
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,840
the security climate intersection for

173
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,199
quite a while now

174
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,919
only within the last uh year to past few

175
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:38,639
months i think

176
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,560
our political leaders waking up and

177
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,800
realizing this is not just a side issue

178
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
for discussion

179
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,560
in the unf triple c in in the cop

180
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,199
process

181
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,960
this is actually a central security

182
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,039
tenant so you have you seen the biden

183
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,240
administration saying this will be

184
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
central to our national

185
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,520
security and defense strategy nato's

186
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
commitment and action plan earlier this

187
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:57,840
week

188
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,080
is huge in terms of pledging investment

189
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,919
and and cooperation a new center for

190
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,199
excellence in canada

191
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
uh these are sort of hot off the press

192
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,560
commitments but they're actually

193
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,400
uh sort of revolutionary in thinking

194
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
about the problem multinationally

195
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,720
thank you johnny i'd like to turn to you

196
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,080
to to expand

197
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,479
a little bit on on what what kate was

198
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,000
saying i mean you've done a lot of work

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,440
on this in terms of how you're thinking

200
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
about multinational institutions could

201
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,639
you um expand a little bit on her

202
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
comments please

203
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,919
yeah thanks um absolutely okay uh

204
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,960
uh rachel i think um

205
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,840
i i'd agree with what what kate's set

206
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,720
out and i think

207
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
also there's there's there's something

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
like a symbolic significance as well

209
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
with multilateral

210
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,879
institutions and entities like nato um

211
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,199
making such statements people might not

212
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,879
be satisfied with the

213
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,440
the meat of what the g7 has come out

214
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,160
with

215
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,840
or be um frustrated that there's no kind

216
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,160
of

217
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,039
timeline or an endpoint or nothing

218
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
specifically measurable in the nato

219
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,639
climate action plan that was launched

220
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,280
uh on monday climate security action

221
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
plan that was launched on monday but i

222
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,280
think there's a real

223
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,840
um symbolic significance of uh

224
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
institutions like nato

225
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,039
like the eu like the g7 um

226
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,039
making climate change but also climate

227
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,080
change and security

228
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
uh central to um to their agendas at the

229
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,840
moment

230
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,360
but also on a more practical level i

231
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,440
think there's there's a value in what

232
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,039
they are doing whilst they're not kind

233
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,440
of

234
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,120
at that point where the rubber can hit

235
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,319
the road and they can get down to

236
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680
operations

237
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
there is um i think quite substantive

238
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,719
action

239
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,039
in at the strategic level where there's

240
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,880
there are efforts to integrate

241
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,599
climate security considerations into

242
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,200
strategic planning

243
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,240
if you look at the eu's road map

244
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
its climate change and defense roadmap

245
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
that it launched last year

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
it specifically looks to integrate

247
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,320
climate change into all defense actions

248
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,440
across the eu

249
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,200
by increasing its understanding of

250
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,920
security implications of climate change

251
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
uh increasing its understanding of how

252
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,279
climate change affects its missions

253
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,040
um now and in the future and then in

254
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
uh addressing a better understanding and

255
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
then addressing um the infrastructure

256
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,680
side of things how it

257
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,760
has to improve infrastructure to

258
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,440
effectively carry out sustainable

259
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,240
missions

260
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,839
so you know they're building it into

261
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,680
that that knowledge interest

262
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,920
strategy and then you you need that

263
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
knowledge before you can get down to

264
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,120
operations yes we do also be

265
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
uh need to be acting at the operational

266
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,399
level but um

267
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,760
i think the strategic um piece is

268
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,959
is really um something to be

269
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,120
lauded as well and we see that in the in

270
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,760
the nato declaration in the nato

271
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,000
action plan as well but then also if you

272
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,519
look at uh institutions like

273
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,040
the un system they're also quite um

274
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,720
substantive steps taken there not you

275
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
know not as far as we want it to be

276
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
but uh the the un just a few years ago

277
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
about three years ago established the

278
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,160
climate security mechanism

279
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,120
which um essentially is a an

280
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,320
institutional home

281
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
for this issue of climate security which

282
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,839
was um

283
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,360
nomadic and therefore was falling

284
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,040
between the cracks within the u.n system

285
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,920
between you know it wasn't the

286
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,480
responsibility of any one single agency

287
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
and now there is this um mechanism which

288
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,839
um it's the kind of the clearinghouse

289
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,079
the the the filter uh

290
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,320
and the the part of the un system that

291
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,399
is responsible for ensuring that

292
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,399
this issue is um cross-fertilized and

293
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,000
then disseminated to all the relevant

294
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,360
agencies that need to be

295
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
um acting on this so i think i think

296
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
this there is some real practical value

297
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
and and this of this these multilateral

298
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,240
initiatives

299
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,880
which then need to be kind of need to

300
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,079
filter down into the

301
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,160
the very practical operational steps at

302
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,720
a more localized level

303
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,480
thank you brian i'd like to bring you

304
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,760
into the conversation

305
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,160
um you know coming from boeing in in the

306
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
private sector

307
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,800
seems like this is really where the

308
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,480
rubber meets the road in

309
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,160
in terms of ensuring that the climate

310
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
and you know reducing emissions is

311
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,920
something that

312
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
organizations are are thinking about and

313
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
taking into consideration

314
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,680
when making their plans especially for a

315
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,800
global company so

316
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,519
how is it that boeing is thinking about

317
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,560
um

318
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,200
you know working with the defense sector

319
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,160
to

320
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
reducing global global gas emissions

321
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,000
from from from from where you're sitting

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,320
what does that look like

323
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
yeah hey thanks rachel and also thanks

324
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
to globestech for for having us

325
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,920
on this panel um it's an honor to be

326
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,240
here um look we have a vital role to

327
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,720
play in decarbonizing aerospace and

328
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,279
we're hard at work in doing so so at

329
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,800
boeing we want to be a trusted partner

330
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,560
and we want to be transparent and

331
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,959
bringing

332
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,360
innovative solutions to our uh customers

333
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,800
and that's on the commercial side

334
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
as well as on the defense side i think

335
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,800
the good news is that

336
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,399
operational effectiveness and

337
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,480
sustainability support each other

338
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
they're really two sides of the same

339
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,200
coin and

340
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,880
you know i think as kate and janani said

341
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
there's some real momentum right now

342
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,839
on the commercial side if you look at

343
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,480
all the declarations it's a hit net zero

344
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,399
by the middle of the century and even

345
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
coming out of nato this week um i think

346
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,279
as kate said

347
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,880
um there's there's a lot of forward

348
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,480
progress and it'll always be a team

349
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,000
sport between industry

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,399
and government uh real quickly how we

351
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,240
look at at decarbonizing aerospace it

352
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,920
really falls into four buckets and i'd

353
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,120
love to elaborate later

354
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
on how that might be relevant for the

355
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
for the military but it's first it's

356
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,440
fleet renewal

357
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
right taking less efficient products and

358
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,120
airplanes out of

359
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,519
the fleets and replacing them with more

360
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,880
efficient airplanes makes sense four

361
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
engines to two engines

362
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,160
on the operations side it's the second

363
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,639
pillar using digital tools

364
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,639
using analytics to fly more efficiently

365
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,160
to operate more efficiently whether it's

366
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
in the or on the ground

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,399
and then thirdly renewable energy and i

368
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,920
think that is perhaps even though we

369
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,279
always say there's no silver bullet but

370
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,800
if you're looking for one

371
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,279
it may be sustainable aviation fuels are

372
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,279
sustainable fuels

373
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
we have a long legacy in pioneering that

374
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,120
space

375
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
first commercial flight in 2008 on the

376
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
747 we flew an f and 18

377
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,000
um super hornet with uh with the united

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,120
states navy

379
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,639
which is called the green hornet on

380
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
staff c17 which is uh present in uh

381
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,360
in nato and papa hungary also flew on on

382
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,399
staff so

383
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,680
it's it's technically viable it's ready

384
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,240
but it needs to be commercially scaled

385
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,600
and then finally the fourth pillar of

386
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
how we are decarbonizing aerospace

387
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,600
is new technology whether that's through

388
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,079
autonomous systems lighter materials

389
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,720
more digital design so we have many

390
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,399
levers at our disposal

391
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,320
but transferring some of those now to

392
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,920
some of our military partners is an

393
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,800
exciting opportunity

394
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,320
thank you um i i like to broaden the

395
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
aperture a little bit and i'm going to

396
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,440
ask kate and alexander both

397
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,160
both to address this question if you

398
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,199
look at the

399
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,959
meetings that have taken place over the

400
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,720
last week with nato

401
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,079
u.s eu the g7

402
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,600
i'm thinking specifically about nato's

403
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
new strategic concept which will

404
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,440
involve china and russia heavily

405
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,800
they also have to be partners in in

406
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
the the fight against uh climate change

407
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,199
and the climate crisis

408
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,839
so how do you have you know these these

409
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,000
two strategic competitors in russia and

410
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
china on so many other things um

411
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,720
play a role uh that helps us

412
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,320
go forward in a way that um you know

413
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,800
combats uh climate change kate i'll ask

414
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
you for that and then alexander i'll

415
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:30,800
come

416
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
back to you yeah look it's a question of

417
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
how do you compete and cooperate at the

418
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
same time and i can tell you it is the

419
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,440
question

420
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,000
in in the debate halls of dc right now

421
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
especially when it comes to climate

422
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,079
especially when it comes to china um how

423
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,160
i see it and i sort of work on

424
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,199
uh climate as a geopolitical issue and

425
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
and the winners and losers and all of

426
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,560
those questions

427
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,959
i think increasingly we are entering a

428
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,079
moment of great power competition

429
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,399
you've seen this in the pacific in the

430
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,279
arctic

431
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,680
what i hope for is that climate change

432
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,560
and action on

433
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,320
on both reducing emissions but also

434
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,839
hopefully action on the security

435
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,440
concepts of climate change

436
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,920
are just so important and of such mutual

437
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,360
interest to countries

438
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,199
um that the the great powers can

439
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,480
cooperate on these issues

440
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,279
and i see that uh very starkly between

441
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,639
the u.s and china and

442
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,720
and russia specifically all three of

443
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,399
these countries are facing immense

444
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:24,959
impacts

445
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,639
offense immense destabilization at home

446
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,040
in their neighborhoods because of of

447
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,560
climate change and not just in the long

448
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,519
term right this is

449
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,759
the next few decades we'll see uh

450
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,680
dramatic impacts in those regions that

451
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,800
all countries

452
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,399
especially super power countries will

453
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,160
have to deal with so it is in their

454
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,839
mutual interest to make sure that we're

455
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,600
bending that curve of emissions

456
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
and we're also building resilience in

457
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,759
areas to to prevent some of the worst uh

458
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,959
security outcomes

459
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,440
so to me it's an issue where yes we

460
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,160
might be

461
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
heavily competing i speak as an american

462
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,040
with our adversaries on many other

463
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,839
issues

464
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,199
trade and and security and and the rest

465
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,519
climate can potentially be one of those

466
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,040
touchstone areas where we can come

467
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,440
together

468
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,880
still come to the table and speak in

469
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,800
mutual interests you saw this

470
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,199
during the cold war right you had bitter

471
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,399
adversaries

472
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,560
of the us and ussr still working

473
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,000
together on issues like nuclear

474
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,120
nonproliferation

475
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
and having those spaces where you can

476
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,279
build trust where you can

477
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,360
have scientific cooperation all the rest

478
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
can actually be a really important

479
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
thing for what is otherwise an

480
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,959
increasingly competitive moment

481
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,120
thank you alexander i'd like to turn to

482
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,160
you

483
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,600
if you could respond to that as well yes

484
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,360
i very much agree with uh

485
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,519
what kate was just saying we're all in

486
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,880
this together it's

487
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,320
with one uh tiny planet you fly around

488
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,800
it in

489
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
in what is it in two days you can fly

490
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,399
around the planet we're all stuck here

491
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,160
in in in space

492
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,480
and we have to deal with this very same

493
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,519
problem uh

494
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,440
china will be an essential

495
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
partner i think that's the right word in

496
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,279
in solving

497
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,079
uh the the climate crisis and and by the

498
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,799
way we have

499
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,880
quite a few other planetary crisis as

500
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,480
well in in

501
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,439
pollution and loss of nature etc china

502
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,799
produces i believe

503
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,359
uh 28 of um of of the co2 emissions in

504
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,000
the world which

505
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,039
is more than all the uh the the

506
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,679
the classical developed nations together

507
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,720
produce so we need china on board

508
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,760
i think china did a huge step

509
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
what was it about a year ago when they

510
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
said that

511
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,880
they would become they would

512
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,520
reach net zero by by 2060

513
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,120
after that of course everybody has been

514
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
pushing for become a bit more concrete

515
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,080
they've come forward a little bit they

516
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,880
are on track

517
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,280
of course not fast enough but that's the

518
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
same that you can say for

519
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,200
for the developed worlds and the g7

520
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,799
countries

521
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,000
historically we were the first ones

522
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,240
that started polluting a country like

523
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,600
united states is

524
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
in in absolute terms of all the

525
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,080
greenhouse gases that they have produced

526
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,720
since

527
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,880
the start of the industrial revolution

528
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,919
uh the us

529
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,160
is still the winner so that also gives a

530
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
responsibility we have the means

531
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,280
to adapt and we have the uh

532
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
we carry the guilt of of having produced

533
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,880
so much greenhouse gases that's

534
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
that we should do so uh on the other

535
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,600
hand if you look at this moment

536
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,400
in in in the dire situation we're in of

537
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
course we have to look at china that is

538
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,360
that is producing uh so much so we need

539
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,039
to work together

540
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,720
think of examples like for instance

541
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,480
india and pakistan since the second

542
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,760
world war they fought

543
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,120
three wars but in the meantime they

544
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,919
have always kept cooperating on

545
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,600
transboundary rivers

546
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,520
there's like six main rivers that that

547
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,919
go from one country to the others and

548
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,120
they have been working and cooperating

549
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,320
on transboundary waters even while they

550
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,880
were

551
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,400
um at war so um and i also like the

552
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
the comparison that cages made with our

553
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,799
relationship with the soviet union

554
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,160
during the cold war

555
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,280
so we need to to put

556
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,600
climate change and all these planetary

557
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,760
change issues that we're talking about

558
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,360
in in an area where we can keep talking

559
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
and keep working together and as a last

560
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
comment here

561
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,080
it's not only the threats which are huge

562
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
for a country like china it's one meter

563
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,120
sea level rise

564
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,240
is a third of shanghai underwater

565
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,160
but there's also a lot of opportunities

566
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
especially for china because the the

567
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,520
renewable

568
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,919
uh energy that we want to produce we

569
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,880
need

570
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,080
um the the the the

571
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,760
the the precious resources that uh that

572
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,720
that china has so there's an opportunity

573
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,919
for them as well and

574
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,440
by the way everything we consume is

575
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,679
nowadays producing in china so

576
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,840
there's a competition but there's also a

577
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,520
lot of dependencies

578
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,320
uh so it it asks for really really

579
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,880
skilled

580
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,000
diplomacy on all sides

581
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
thank you john annie i'd like to bring

582
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,240
it to you before we get to before we get

583
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,799
to slido um

584
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,559
climate migration is increasingly

585
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,799
a an issue but um will affect the

586
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,039
national security for for many countries

587
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:25,919
not just in

588
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,640
in europe but the united states as well

589
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,039
so

590
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,880
how does climate migration play into

591
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,640
this to this broader question

592
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,200
is that something that you're looking at

593
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,240
i mean how do we have these

594
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,919
conversations in a way that i think

595
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,039
centers humanitarianism but at the at

596
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,840
the same

597
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,799
time requires cooperation between

598
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,240
between many countries at once

599
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,280
uh thanks rachel so i think the

600
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,880
first thing i'd like to stress is that

601
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,760
when the the term climate migration is

602
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,440
somewhat problematic because there's

603
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,799
never a single reason

604
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,000
that people move um it's always

605
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,039
a complex mix of factors and uh climate

606
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,400
might be part of it

607
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,039
but um it may not be the driver a lot of

608
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,799
people are displaced absolutely

609
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,679
displaced by sudden shocks like um

610
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,720
intense storms

611
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,840
or slow onset climate impacts like you

612
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,559
know ongoing bouts over multiple years

613
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,919
um but this idea of

614
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,039
um of the increased number of people

615
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:27,840
that are

616
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,520
having to move be it because they're

617
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,880
they're displaced or they

618
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
it's feeding in these climate stresses

619
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,320
are feeding into their

620
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
broader decisions to to migrate um

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,200
it is part of the security they can

622
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,880
human security risk landscape that we're

623
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,799
looking at uh linked to climate change

624
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,000
but it's not the whole

625
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,480
um so i'd just like to speak about that

626
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
in in a bit but when it comes to

627
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,400
um climate mobility or like the

628
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,600
climate related mobility or migration

629
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,039
it's um it's a it's a narrative which is

630
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,760
very

631
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,159
it can it it's it's got to be handled

632
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,120
really sensitively

633
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,799
if you look at the numbers if you really

634
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,679
look at people on the move

635
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,360
most people are moving a lot of people

636
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
are moving and most people are moving

637
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,840
within countries so there really isn't

638
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,039
the evidence

639
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,320
that um that the media might lead us to

640
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,240
believe of kind of hordes of migrants

641
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,159
moving because of climate change

642
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,200
from the sahel into southern europe and

643
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,840
then into

644
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,880
into northern europe or from um

645
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,280
central america into into north america

646
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,559
what we mainly see is stressed

647
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,080
communities whose livelihoods

648
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
are becoming less and less viable in the

649
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,520
face of climate change

650
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,159
making decisions to maybe move from

651
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,240
rural communities to the urban centers

652
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,840
within the same country or just cross

653
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,480
the border

654
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,440
within the same region so you see um the

655
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,880
the exponential growth

656
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,880
of um second cities or

657
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
um all the capitals which just don't

658
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,039
have in already fragile context which

659
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,400
just don't have the governance

660
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,480
structures and the infrastructure

661
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,360
and the social safety nets to to absorb

662
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,760
the

663
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
these um these incomers so that

664
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,760
is um for me the the

665
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,520
climate-related uh migration risk that

666
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,240
we need to be

667
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,159
really focusing on because as there are

668
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,000
these um

669
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,919
ill-governed urban centers growing

670
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,360
in places like nigeria or pakistan

671
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
there is much more likelihood of

672
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,559
instability and

673
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,039
and conflict in these contexts than

674
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,240
there are there is

675
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,360
um with this kind of trans boundary kind

676
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,840
of

677
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,080
africa into europe uh latin america

678
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,799
central america into uh the us

679
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,520
um discourse but as i mentioned i think

680
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,480
the climate

681
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
related migration piece is only part of

682
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,919
the broader uh

683
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,840
landscape of risks which climate change

684
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,000
is presenting um

685
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,559
to human security um you might have

686
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,039
heard

687
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,520
climate described as a threat multiplier

688
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,080
or a crisis multiplier is i think how

689
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,080
jens stoltenberg described it at the

690
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,919
nato summit um

691
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,640
earlier in the week but what does this

692
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,480
actually mean it's not just about kind

693
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,600
of um

694
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,360
migration and people having to move and

695
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,799
the the risks um

696
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
and potential conflict risks linked to

697
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,840
this it's

698
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
it means that climate change through a

699
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
range of impacts from these kind of

700
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,400
hydro meteorological um direct impacts

701
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,799
like droughts floods more intense storms

702
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,279
um having this kind of knock-on

703
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,320
consequence on

704
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,159
on human um well-being through

705
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,960
and affecting economic development and

706
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,480
reversing development gains and

707
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,120
reversing peace gains

708
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,159
and these risks these these risk

709
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,080
pathways are incredibly complex and

710
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,480
they're

711
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,240
incredibly context dependent but they

712
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,559
tend to always be grounded in specific

713
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,320
social political and economic dynamics

714
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,679
things particularly

715
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,080
relating to livelihood stresses and

716
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,760
pre-existing inequalities

717
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,559
and different differential access to

718
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:09,039
power

719
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,039
and access to natural resources so when

720
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,880
it comes to thinking about what to do

721
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,240
about this i think it

722
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,640
has to go beyond thinking about oh how

723
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,919
many people are moving

724
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,360
and how do we stop them it's about

725
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,120
understanding um

726
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,679
why why people are more vulnerable to

727
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,159
these climate security risks is because

728
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,760
they are already marginalized they're

729
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,080
from a particular ethno religious group

730
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,720
or they

731
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
they are women or children or disabled

732
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,039
who have um already got constraints on

733
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,559
their access to natural resources which

734
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,919
climate change is

735
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,200
um magnifying or amplifying or they have

736
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
livelihoods that are dependent

737
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,600
on natural resources and rainfall which

738
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:47,919
are

739
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,440
becoming less and less viable in the

740
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,080
face of greater climate variability

741
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,279
um so i think it's important to see

742
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,960
all the different pathways that play out

743
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,720
in the different contexts and

744
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
certainly climate related mobility

745
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,039
displacement and migration is a piece of

746
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,159
this but there are many

747
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,279
many of these pathways thank you so much

748
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,120
and and brian i wanted i wanted to come

749
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,480
to you and

750
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,640
build on something that john any said

751
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,799
johnny you mentioned human security

752
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,159
a few times uh in in in your in your

753
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:18,720
comments

754
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
and i think the paradox when it comes to

755
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,640
human security is that

756
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
for a lot of countries this this

757
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
includes you know deployment operations

758
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,200
and stability operations which then

759
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,000
leave carbon footprints and and so i'm

760
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,039
wondering brian

761
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,640
you know when you think about how

762
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,600
industry and military come together to

763
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,640
reduce the carbon

764
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,480
footprint of of major deployment

765
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,320
operations how how are you thinking

766
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,480
about that

767
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,640
yeah that's a really good question i

768
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,720
mean corporation with with military is

769
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,559
in our dna they're a customer so

770
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,080
it's our first job to listen to their

771
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
requirements and to bring innovative

772
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,200
solutions but

773
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,960
um as it relates to climate i think

774
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,039
alexander calls this one's a faceless

775
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,000
enemy so we're gonna

776
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,159
fight that enemy together and an

777
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,840
industry and military's long partner

778
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,159
i'm thinking since it's nato week among

779
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:06,880
others

780
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,120
i'm thinking of our nato awax program

781
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,360
where 16 nations have come together

782
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,440
and what nato has called one of the most

783
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,039
successful collaborative

784
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,720
adventures ever undertaken by the

785
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,799
alliance pooling sharing

786
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,880
partnering with across militaries and

787
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,240
with industry

788
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
is a well-proven concept that that works

789
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,279
well

790
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,039
you know the secretary general said

791
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,279
earlier this week that he wants nato

792
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,799
and the forces in general to be more

793
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,720
capable more digital

794
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,120
and more green and you think about each

795
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,480
of these buckets

796
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,200
um on the capabilities side at boeing

797
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,080
and again

798
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,320
it's it's what we do we've invested 60

799
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,919
billion dollars of our own money over

800
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:45,120
the last decade

801
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,399
with innovative technologies and

802
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,399
capabilities many of which

803
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,600
uh directly to reduce our environmental

804
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,480
footprint and

805
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,159
and advance sort of the environmental

806
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,679
progressive

807
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,399
aspects of our products on the digital

808
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:58,799
side

809
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,240
again as i said earlier there are a lot

810
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,399
of tools and capabilities that we're

811
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,080
putting in the hands of our customers

812
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,679
that allow them to operate more

813
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,360
efficiently whether it's again in the

814
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:07,919
air

815
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,320
or on the ground in the air we have

816
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,200
digital

817
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
tools that allow flights to be more

818
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,640
direct

819
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,919
to anticipate weather um so so every

820
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,960
every ounce of fuel burn matters and so

821
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,720
these digital tools and the analytics

822
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,360
behind it

823
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
um are really important and then his

824
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,960
point of being more green

825
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,360
i want to get back to it i think

826
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,000
renewable

827
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,960
energy whether that's on the ground and

828
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,080
there have been many

829
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,799
smart smart defense initiatives at nato

830
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,000
that have have

831
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,320
piloted that or in the air with

832
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
sustainable aviation fuels which are 50

833
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,039
to 80

834
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,080
lower co2 um i think are are perfect

835
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,760
examples of where we can partner to

836
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,640
further

837
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,039
bend the curve and uh and achieve net

838
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,480
zero which nato as

839
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
kate said earlier has set out to achieve

840
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,840
by the middle of the um

841
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,760
century thank you so we have

842
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,840
a little over 15 minutes left so i want

843
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,200
to go ahead and turn to audience

844
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,720
questions i'll start with slido but

845
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,000
again if anyone

846
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,520
has a question that they'd like to ask

847
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,120
live just feel free to raise your hand

848
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,240
i'll find you and you can

849
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
um walk up to the to the microphone and

850
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,679
and ask it yourself

851
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,520
there's a really good question from um

852
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,000
mata slovaki uh from from moody's

853
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,440
who who mentioned uh how

854
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,520
how is the eu going to be able to find

855
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
balance between

856
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,799
going green and ensuring production

857
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,799
being competitive in the global economy

858
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,960
so alexander i'd like to come to you

859
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,760
for that question

860
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,000
uh yeah i think the the eu is is uh is

861
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,360
rapidly advancing in um oh sorry

862
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,080
i have to look at the screen now would i

863
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,960
lost it

864
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,200
um sorry could you repeat the question

865
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,159
yep

866
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,840
between going green and ensuring

867
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,159
production being competitive yes well

868
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,440
the global economy is going to be green

869
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,520
that is the future and so

870
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,559
in in lagging behind now

871
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,399
for for those countries that believe

872
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:11,760
that you can continue

873
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,200
with you know using coal or or having a

874
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,760
fossil

875
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,880
uh fuel based economy um

876
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,279
it it might help you for a little bit in

877
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,399
a short while

878
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,240
but ultimately you have to follow the

879
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,159
new trends in technology it's it's

880
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,919
it's it's one of the uh one of the few

881
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,399
uh things you can you can you can learn

882
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,279
from history

883
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,159
and also think about what brian was just

884
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,200
saying about

885
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,840
uh how boeing is innovating and also in

886
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,360
his cooperation with the military

887
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,799
the military have always been on top of

888
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:47,919
new trends

889
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,720
and for a long time those trends were

890
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,799
going into the direction of more fossil

891
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,360
fuels

892
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,880
there used to be sailing ships with

893
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,279
cannons and spanish galleons whatever

894
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,240
and someday we moved into steam ships

895
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,559
and

896
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,320
and and into into new technology of

897
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,159
using oil and ultimately even

898
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,360
nuclear for for some navy ships uh

899
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,240
but now the new trend is going towards

900
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,080
green and you can't imagine that

901
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,559
the military stays behind there so i

902
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,440
think for

903
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,279
uh the eu is now rapidly

904
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,559
uh becoming more involved on a path uh

905
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,200
towards starts becoming green the the

906
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,519
quite recently the ambitions have been

907
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,720
really increased from um

908
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,880
from from 42 to uh to 55 percent just

909
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,279
just

910
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,480
just recently and i think that is

911
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,720
um that is the new trend where

912
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
where you will find the winners not just

913
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,880
in in europe but but worldwide

914
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,399
thanks brian did you want to add to that

915
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:53,279
i see you not

916
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,200
nodding vigorously sorry

917
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
it's engaging alexander is i think it's

918
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
spot on and and um

919
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,880
just a couple examples come to mind uh

920
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
one being

921
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
again i come back to fuels because

922
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,159
they're that is the carbon we're talking

923
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:08,880
about

924
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,360
and sustainable aviation fuels and the

925
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,000
signal

926
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,799
the mods could send or are sending in

927
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,000
some cases

928
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,320
um are are essential because right now

929
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,240
we can't close or we haven't closed the

930
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,600
price gap

931
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,039
we can we can produce it we know how to

932
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,720
do it and we've flown it

933
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
all the way up to 100 boeing through a

934
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,960
triple seven in 2018 on 100

935
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,000
saf um the problem is that the price

936
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,679
point is two to three x

937
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,919
and so i think a demand signal from the

938
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,080
mods as it's already happening i

939
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,720
saw in the uk ministry of defense has

940
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,640
suggested that 50 of their

941
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,200
at their fleet will fly on 50 staff in

942
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,320
the near future

943
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,159
uh those are really important signals to

944
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,760
the market to the producers to go

945
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,200
produce this stuff

946
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,600
so um and i i come back to the final

947
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,120
point this this notion that they're

948
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,760
really

949
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,840
two sides of the same coin this notion

950
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,559
that a a greener more sustainable

951
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,799
uh force is somehow less capable or

952
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,559
somehow less competitive i think

953
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,919
is false thank you

954
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,799
so i'm gonna ask a couple questions here

955
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,399
and i'm going to turn both to kate and

956
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,279
john any to

957
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,519
to answer them the first one i'm going

958
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,000
to admit ignorance because

959
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,360
you guys are are better uh

960
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,039
suited to to answer these climate

961
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,159
questions and i but there's a really

962
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,360
good question from

963
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,000
lucia that says is geoengineering a

964
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,279
plausible solution

965
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,679
that we can possibly turn to to mitigate

966
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,799
climate change

967
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,200
so i'll ask that one but then also

968
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,039
there's another great question on

969
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,000
what are the biggest issues arising from

970
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,840
uh from climate change for the defense

971
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,320
sector

972
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,159
specifically so kate i'll turn to you

973
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:45,360
and then johnny i'll come to you

974
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,159
afterwards

975
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,960
sure all the easy ones yeah of course

976
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,440
with

977
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,919
geoengineering so i personally i mean

978
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,840
there's a lot more research that that

979
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,760
needs to be done into these technologies

980
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,320
because the

981
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,159
the biggest thing is there are so many

982
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,080
question marks still about how

983
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,640
throwing chemicals into the ocean or

984
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,240
into the atmosphere have

985
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,919
dramatic knock-on effects that we just

986
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,440
don't understand yet that science

987
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,239
hasn't hasn't really gotten its its uh

988
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,440
arms around so

989
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,520
uh you know that's that's not a viable

990
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,119
option for now unless we want to

991
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:15,839
potentially

992
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:18,399
uh uh cause strange triggers in the

993
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,320
climate system that we don't know about

994
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,839
what i am worried about when it comes to

995
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,918
geoengineering is the massive security

996
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,119
threat behind it

997
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,159
um that you know regardless of what it

998
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,679
devastation they could do to our

999
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,000
ecosystems um

1000
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,040
just think about the the nature of

1001
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,280
uh potential blame behind some of those

1002
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,159
events

1003
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,119
so the the example here is say there was

1004
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:41,520
a

1005
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,520
a huge hurricane that we knew was going

1006
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,960
to strike um

1007
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
uh norfolk our our biggest naval base in

1008
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,079
the united states

1009
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,480
um and we potentially had the power uh

1010
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,079
to do something about that which again

1011
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,399
is

1012
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,440
is under doubt uh would we be able to

1013
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,760
say

1014
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,800
yes well we're gonna do this and and

1015
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,520
change the path of this hurricane if it

1016
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,000
had

1017
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,839
knock-on effects down the road that we

1018
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,680
didn't understand and we didn't know

1019
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,880
and the security problem there is as

1020
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,560
soon as that genie is out of the bottle

1021
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,240
you can always blame all the united

1022
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,320
states to that right the united states

1023
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,119
uh was involved in that that that led to

1024
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,640
the drought that we had in mexico

1025
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,079
months later we don't know that that's

1026
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,680
the case um but

1027
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,480
a country can always sort of change and

1028
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,240
point the finger and have that blame

1029
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
right and we see this already

1030
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,440
um unfortunately with climate uh

1031
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,599
effects in places in the middle east and

1032
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,480
in africa

1033
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,760
groups on the ground are taking

1034
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,520
advantage of that climate change for

1035
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,720
their security

1036
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,200
um their security consequences right so

1037
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,960
uh there's great reporting

1038
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,839
out of iraq where isis has used climate

1039
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,520
change as a recruitment tool

1040
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,680
for its ranks right saying look at

1041
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,440
what's happening that's the west

1042
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,280
uh they're to blame for this come and

1043
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,480
join us um

1044
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,320
and and we'll fight back back against

1045
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,599
the people that cause drought in your

1046
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,160
home

1047
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,079
geoengineering to me is that same sort

1048
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:01,200
of blame game

1049
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
where it can be a tool of of

1050
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,680
ethnonationalism and a tool of

1051
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,160
uh sort of increasing tensions between

1052
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,200
countries

1053
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,079
um that to me is uh one of the biggest

1054
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,599
impacts for the defense sector i mean

1055
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,400
you can look at it

1056
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,320
across three different metrics the

1057
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,240
impacts on security environments

1058
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,320
the impacts on security infrastructure

1059
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,000
and the impacts on our security

1060
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,680
institutions as well right

1061
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,760
so you'll have those direct and and

1062
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,520
second and third order consequences on

1063
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,440
the environment that you're operating in

1064
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,760
you'll have increasingly uh devastating

1065
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,359
impacts on your infrastructure think

1066
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,280
about permafrost thought and the arctic

1067
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,839
and

1068
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,400
and the devastating sort of melting that

1069
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,640
that does to often nuclear installations

1070
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,680
in that region

1071
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,240
but also our institutions right can nato

1072
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,599
withstand

1073
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,520
the intense more intense more frequent

1074
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
shocks that are going to be happening in

1075
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,320
its region of the world

1076
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,320
are institutions strong enough to sort

1077
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,000
of stick together and cooperate as we

1078
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,520
talked about in that reality

1079
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,839
i think that's an open question um are

1080
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,040
our alliances

1081
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,280
are our global institutions the u.n

1082
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,040
security council are these bodies fit

1083
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
for purpose to deal with these

1084
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,599
coming trends in these coming threats um

1085
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,880
to me that's maybe the

1086
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,040
the most worrying aspect of of defense

1087
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,000
implications

1088
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,079
thank you johnny i'm going to turn to

1089
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,079
you

1090
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,119
thanks rachel yeah um i think i share

1091
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,079
kate's uh

1092
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,240
concerns and fears about geoengineering

1093
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,119
i

1094
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,400
i think however whatever we

1095
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,960
feel kind of morally and ethically about

1096
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,280
the risks and the uncertainties

1097
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,400
um that it holds it is going ahead

1098
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,359
because there's no control either within

1099
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,119
um in the private sector

1100
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,200
there is a lot of um r d around this

1101
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,720
there's a lot of investments

1102
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,000
um and also in in kind of non-aligned

1103
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,359
countries who might just be advancing

1104
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:50,079
this and even in

1105
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,680
in within the allied allies um nato

1106
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,640
allies are also

1107
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,720
advancing some um um

1108
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,640
avenues of research into this but i

1109
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
think the really

1110
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,000
critical thing is accepting that it is

1111
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,839
happening and it is going to happen

1112
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,400
and that there needs to be um some form

1113
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,560
of global governance in this it it needs

1114
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,520
to be

1115
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,839
regulated because we can't stop it we

1116
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,520
can't stop it we can we can

1117
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,119
hope that it's not going to advance too

1118
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,760
much but pragmatically

1119
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,520
this does need geo engineering does need

1120
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,880
to have

1121
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,560
some regulations within some kind of a

1122
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,079
global governance framework do we have

1123
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:27,359
the multilateral

1124
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,480
institution ready um in place do we have

1125
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,680
the international

1126
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
legal frameworks in place no um so i

1127
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,520
think this is something that we really

1128
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,880
need to be thinking about i mean there

1129
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,040
are efforts around this um the carnegie

1130
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,560
foundation is doing some great work

1131
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,480
here um and i think um

1132
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,920
i think this global governance framework

1133
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
for geoengineering is is critical just

1134
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,880
to

1135
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
you know ensure that when it does happen

1136
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,119
and whatever forms it's taking there are

1137
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:53,599
some

1138
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,359
um rules and some restitution measures

1139
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,040
for the kind of the blame and the the

1140
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,720
consequences that kate touched on

1141
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,680
um in her response and in terms of the

1142
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,520
the challenge for

1143
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,800
uh for the the defense community i think

1144
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,440
the the tripar site kind of system that

1145
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,800
kate set out

1146
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,359
uh is is a really helpful way of

1147
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:16,960
thinking about this how the

1148
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,280
the defense communities got to be ready

1149
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,200
and i think there's a lot of

1150
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,440
um thinking going into mission readiness

1151
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,960
there's al and you know

1152
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,160
changing the way that um military assets

1153
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,960
are

1154
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,079
are being uh planned for the future

1155
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,359
um there's also

1156
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,160
thinking around kind of um the

1157
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,400
challenges around

1158
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,480
needing to do more kind of disaster

1159
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,599
response

1160
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,160
more civilian protection work in places

1161
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,359
like the pacific and

1162
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,800
places that we know are already um

1163
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,720
facing much more intense and frequent

1164
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,240
climate impacts and then

1165
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,400
the security community is having to step

1166
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
up as first responders

1167
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,240
where i think there is a gap is uh that

1168
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,560
the security sector needs to be better

1169
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,200
able to also deal with these these new

1170
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,119
uh climate security risks

1171
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:09,760
that are being created or the climate

1172
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,960
security

1173
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,800
implications which are compounding

1174
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,160
existing conflicts

1175
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,920
uh kate mentioned iraq that's a great

1176
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,839
example another example is the lake chad

1177
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:18,319
region

1178
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:21,520
of um of the sahel where you look at

1179
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,319
existing military operations

1180
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,560
and you see that they are entirely

1181
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,079
climate blind and they're actually doing

1182
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,440
more harm and we've got some really

1183
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,960
compelling evidence i was

1184
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,200
lucky enough to be able to do some field

1185
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,640
work there when we heard from members of

1186
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,920
armed groups and

1187
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,400
um kind of ex-members of armed groups

1188
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,160
like boko haram and islamic state west

1189
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,839
africa saying that the reason that they

1190
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,480
joined

1191
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,119
wasn't to do with any ideological um

1192
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,359
affiliate affinity it was because of the

1193
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,520
security strategies

1194
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,319
of international um stabilization

1195
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:52,960
efforts

1196
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,040
and counter-terror efforts that were

1197
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
undermining their

1198
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,040
livelihoods so kind of um international

1199
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,880
troops coming in with things like slash

1200
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,800
and burn strategies to literally smoke

1201
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,079
out insurgents

1202
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,720
um but then by doing so degrading

1203
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,240
already drought affected

1204
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,359
arid land and soil that are what the the

1205
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,599
this a very agrarian community needs

1206
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,920
to sustain its livelihood these kind of

1207
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,880
operations

1208
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,000
these strategies uh were then

1209
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,680
really locking people into this kind of

1210
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,280
climate security cycle

1211
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,520
um of of conflict because there was just

1212
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,960
no way out then if your livelihood's

1213
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,440
been

1214
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,160
eroded now for the next decade they had

1215
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,720
no choice but to join armed groups um

1216
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,280
and also we're just so angry at such um

1217
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,880
such blindness so i think this

1218
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
there's a real need to climate-proof

1219
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,040
security strategies and stabilization

1220
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,880
strategies and peacekeeping and i think

1221
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,400
that's a real knowledge gap that needs

1222
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,119
to be

1223
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,160
um filled by the security community

1224
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,240
thank you okay so we have about four

1225
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,240
minutes left so i'm gonna go

1226
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,640
around the horn and everyone has about a

1227
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,520
minute

1228
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,599
we have talked about when it comes to

1229
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,440
climate and and the intersection

1230
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,119
of climate and security we've talked

1231
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,880
about multinational institutions the

1232
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,640
private sector

1233
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,119
global partnerships what did we miss

1234
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,720
what is it that the audience should know

1235
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,240
what should we be thinking about that we

1236
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,880
didn't

1237
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,160
discuss today uh alexander brian

1238
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,760
johnny and then i'll close with kate

1239
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,560
alexander do you

1240
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,240
i think the key message should be that

1241
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,680
we can solve climate change we know how

1242
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,400
to do it

1243
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,839
we have the knowledge we have the

1244
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:30,400
technology we

1245
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,880
even have the money it is less expensive

1246
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,760
to do it now

1247
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,960
than to wait and we know exactly how to

1248
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,599
do it

1249
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,160
and a huge part of that is following

1250
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,000
everything that we have promised to each

1251
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,240
other to do in in 2015

1252
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,520
in in the agenda 2030 and

1253
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,440
we can't do it the only thing that is

1254
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,800
lacking

1255
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,920
is leadership and political will

1256
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,119
and good international cooperation i'm

1257
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:58,079
hopeful for this

1258
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,200
year that after four dreadful years

1259
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,720
where the biggest leader in the world

1260
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,119
was

1261
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,119
not leading and only creating

1262
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,720
devastating policies

1263
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,520
that now that the us is back in the game

1264
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:09,839
and

1265
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,920
is leading that we have a chance because

1266
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:12,960
if the us

1267
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,839
is not there nothing happens if the u.s

1268
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,319
is there

1269
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,520
something can happen uh but is it

1270
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,319
is it enough that we see no it isn't uh

1271
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:23,440
leading up to cop

1272
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,480
26 it is so important that this year

1273
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,280
becomes something like the second half

1274
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,280
of 2015 where there's hope

1275
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,440
where we set the right policies and

1276
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,560
where we go forward

1277
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
because it is doable that's my one

1278
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,680
minute i hope

1279
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,359
thank you brian yeah look i thought was

1280
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,880
a really good discussion um the one

1281
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,640
thing that jumps to mind is target

1282
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,440
setting

1283
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,200
um i think the secretary general talked

1284
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,200
about um sort of realistic

1285
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,480
ambitious and concrete targets you know

1286
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,280
at boeing we we hit net zero for our own

1287
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,200
operations inside of our four walls last

1288
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,079
year

1289
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,599
and um you can do that when you know

1290
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,760
what you're netting against and um so i

1291
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,480
think

1292
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,680
um whether it's with the u.s

1293
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,760
administration or or indeed

1294
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,400
at nato setting some targets out and

1295
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,839
then being able to measure against those

1296
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:10,720
it's an important

1297
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,119
um opportunity and where industry can

1298
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,000
help in that

1299
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,160
we've been on a journey for some time

1300
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,920
and and burning down

1301
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,760
and decarbonizing our operations and our

1302
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,440
and our footprint

1303
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,359
so i think that would be one point thank

1304
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,680
you jenna knee over to you but you got

1305
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,880
about 30 seconds

1306
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,160
and then i'll close the camera goodness

1307
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,720
okay um well i think a lot of the

1308
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,480
conversation we've had it focuses on

1309
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,200
mitigation on reducing emissions i think

1310
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,280
we also need to give equal space to

1311
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,119
adaptations the need to adapt to the

1312
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,440
climate risks already at play i think

1313
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,520
oftentimes people get fixated on

1314
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,440
technical responses to these climate

1315
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,240
risks

1316
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,440
um and i'd say a real priority uh

1317
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,880
within the frame of this kind of need to

1318
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,560
look at also adaptation is

1319
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,359
um looking at what drives climate

1320
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,040
security risks um

1321
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,880
and so programming responses need to

1322
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,040
focus also on things these kind of

1323
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,640
soft and maybe you know i'm very aware

1324
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,040
of being the uh the civil society voice

1325
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,400
in this uh security

1326
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,119
uh conference but um people-centered

1327
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,560
issues things like bolstering social

1328
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,480
cohesion building trust between state

1329
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,280
and people

1330
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,280
and redressing inequalities now these

1331
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,319
aren't kind of big

1332
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:19,280
um military uh approaches but i think

1333
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,480
these these are the factors that

1334
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,680
underlie vulnerability the

1335
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,599
marginalization of women and group

1336
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:25,599
youth for example and this is what makes

1337
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,040
them vulnerable to climate and conflict

1338
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,880
risks and so this also needs to be part

1339
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:29,359
of

1340
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,640
what we're thinking about in terms of

1341
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,200
future engagement thank you

1342
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,960
okay if i could take us home yeah well

1343
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,880
underscore all of all of what was just

1344
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,720
said from each angle i mean the way i

1345
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,280
see this

1346
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,839
is this is now a central defense and

1347
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:42,880
security issue

1348
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,960
it's not a side environment issue

1349
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,400
anymore this is

1350
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,800
the stuff of strategic competition of

1351
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,599
the future

1352
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,079
between all of our nations so it's not

1353
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:52,720
something that

1354
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,440
that we can just uh forget about or keep

1355
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,640
to the environment ministries

1356
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,720
anymore it's stuff that our defense

1357
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,319
ministries need to understand

1358
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:02,400
the problem is is we often don't have

1359
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,599
the talent in

1360
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,880
our mods in our senior

1361
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,920
political uh diplomats to understand

1362
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,720
these problems

1363
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,200
so i i guess i challenge all of you to

1364
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,000
to

1365
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,680
think really seriously about the the

1366
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,119
training and education that needs to

1367
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,200
happen in in your security sectors

1368
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,040
to understand these problems you know

1369
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,359
climate change is a messy complicated

1370
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,000
issue it

1371
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,520
involves a lot of science it involves a

1372
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,240
lot of modeling are your uh

1373
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,079
forces understanding what to do in those

1374
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,839
situations do they know sort of how to

1375
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,359
climate-proof their operations how to

1376
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:34,400
build resilience

1377
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,920
um it's going to take investment and

1378
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,599
it's going to take retraining

1379
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,280
and i i would be remiss if i didn't

1380
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,880
mention so our

1381

1383
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,920
