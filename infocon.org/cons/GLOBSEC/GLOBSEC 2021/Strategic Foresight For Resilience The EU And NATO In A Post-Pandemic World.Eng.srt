the last two days

68
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,919
but this is the time when we have

69
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,800

for inter-institutional questions and

76
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,199
foresight

77
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,400
and we have joining us uh virtually

78
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
online

79
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,399
mercedes the uh deputy secretary general

80
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,958
of nato so welcome to you gentlemen um

81
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,159
uh i i think we should start with uh

82
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
personalized questions to the two

83
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,519
speakers

84
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,399
possible follow-up questions our time is

85
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,519
rather limited

86
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,640
um we have about uh 30

87
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,160
uh two minutes from now and um

88
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,240
therefore we need to keep it brief in

89
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,839
the beginning um

90
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
we want to have as much as possible

91
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,279
interaction

92
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,320
with the audience and that includes the

93
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,800
online audience of course

94
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,760
so um that without further ado let me

95
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,120
just um

96
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,519
throw out a couple of uh a couple of

97
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,120
buzzwords

98
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,640
so we're talking about the the trends uh

99
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
threatening resilience that the pandemic

100
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,399
has reinforced

101
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,399
uh we talked about um thinking forward

102
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
about uh thinking and acting

103
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,160
um right now about the complementarity

104
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,880
of both nato and the european union

105
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,399
um also about uh addressing capacity

106
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,200
gaps

107
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,519
and of course most of all lessons for

108
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,000
the future of both organizations

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,320
so um since we just had the nato summit

110
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,440
um a couple of days ago let me first

111
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,240
turn to

112
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
miguel joanna from nato

113
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,360
and uh ask him the question

114
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
what role did democratic resilience

115
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,959
or resilience in a broader sense play at

116
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,640
the last nato summit

117
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,680

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,200
physically but

129
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
you know the uh he's very very

130
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,680
complicated after our summit

131
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,959
uh we've been uh debating on a on a

132
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,279
physical stage just a few days ago

133
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,519
the topic of resilience when we visited

134
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,360
together bucharest

135
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,240
inaugurated a euro-atlantic resilience

136
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,880
center

137
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,760
hosted by romania let me tell you a few

138
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,200
things about

139
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
about where we stand in nato and where i

140
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,079
do believe

141
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,000
that nato and eu could should and will

142
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
do more together the first thing

143
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,440
nato summit and if you look through the

144
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
long final communique

145
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,360
and if you look from the inside on the

146
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,279
nato 2030 decisions

147
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,800
by the 30 allied leaders you'll see a

148
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,160
big chunk

149
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,680
dedicated to resilience nato has been

150
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,959
embarking on identifying

151
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,480
and sizzling

152
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,040
what you call baseline requirements on

153
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,760
resilience

154
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,880
basically resilience indicators this

155
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,360
started

156
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,680
at the warsaw nato summit in 2016

157
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,079
these indicators have been presented

158
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,120
to nato allies to nations and

159
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,480
every year at the national level allies

160
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,120
were measuring themselves against these

161
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,000
indicators

162
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
thus identifying the strong points and

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
also the weaker points

164
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,839
of course as you mentioned roland the

165
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,440
pandemic has brought

166
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,480
even more complex dimensions to the

167
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,000
issue of resilience

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
we are now speaking and acting and this

169
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,560
is what our leaders decided

170
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,480
at the nato summit to have in a renew

171
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,200
resilience commitment what does it mean

172
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
that we look even more attentively to

173
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,279
the

174
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,079
existing indicators of nato but also

175
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,320
will be looking even more

176
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,399
attentively to a broader definition of

177
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,440
resilience

178
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,920
supply chains issues related to

179
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,800
fdi and screening of fdi because it's

180
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,120
not

181
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
irrelevant to our resilience who is

182
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,480
investing in what and where

183
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,079
in our businesses in our infrastructures

184
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,880
telecommunications and so on and so

185
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,680
forth

186
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,959
so this is something that we have

187
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,680
decided something even more interesting

188
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,639
and important i think

189
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,440
politically is that our leaders agreed

190
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
to the proposition of secretary general

191
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,320
stoltenberg

192
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,399
that on an annual basis high level

193
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,560
representatives

194
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,880
in national governments across the

195
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,920
alliance

196
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,800
will be meeting and this will also be i

197
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
think the next stage

198
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,320
between the national prerogative because

199
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
in the end it's a national and

200
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,920
subnational prerogative resilience

201
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,040
but nato is a fantastic platform

202
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
to making sure that we look at these

203
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,079
things together

204
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,480
and of course uh nato eu i've been

205
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,160
working with maurice on this one

206
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,760
uh maresh i think we've been doing this

207
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,920
for the last one and a half years

208
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,839
already i think

209
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,399
when jen stottenberg was invited for the

210
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,120
first time

211
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
by president van der lion to meet the

212
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
college of commissioners

213
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,320
uh i think the first topic chosen by the

214
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,000
two organizations by the leadership of

215
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,440
our two organizations

216
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,680
for nato and the eu eu and nato to look

217
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,959
even more

218
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,920
intimately into the first one is

219
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,720
resilience

220
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,639
of course then it's new technologies

221
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,320
then we're looking into climate change

222
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,839
and to space there are lots of things

223
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,560
nato and eu should and will do more

224
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,120
together

225
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,440
of course you already do a lot so this

226
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,639
is where we are

227
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,800
uh a pivotal moment for the alliance as

228
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,959
a whole a very successful summit

229
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,399
i understand that it was a very

230
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
successful high-level meeting between

231
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
president biden and the eu leadership

232
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
again a very successful g7

233
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,120
meeting before and now we can also look

234
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,839
with all the democratic political west

235
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,959
uh

236
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,160
reunited in a very positive way that the

237
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,519
meeting between president biden and

238
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,199
president putin in geneva which was

239
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,480
you know something that was very well

240
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,320
prepared by the sequence

241
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
of high-level uh participations by the

242
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,680
u.s president

243
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,920
so i see a lot of potential in nato eu

244
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,199
cooperation on resilience i also know

245
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
that the toolbox of nato is not

246
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
identical and it shouldn't be to the one

247
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,760
of the eu eu has

248
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
a number of instruments and marish

249
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,120
probably will tell you more about that

250
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,880
and foresight because that's the topic

251
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,199
of our panel is also part of this

252
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,120
because anticipating change and

253
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,320
potential crisis

254
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
is important you mentioned democratic

255
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,600
resilience

256
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
i will go back to something that

257
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,720
fukuyama said in the in the clip you

258
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,160
presented before our panel

259
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,199
it's also about the trust of our

260
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
citizens of our public opinions

261
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,680
in the institutions of democracy in our

262
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
governments

263
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,160
in what we do in international

264
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,240
organizations like nato and eu

265
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,519
so i do believe that societal resilience

266
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,519
this is how we approach resilience as a

267
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,120
comprehensive concept

268
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,759
also has a very important democratic

269
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,600
resiliency if you want

270
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,839
some friends in the northern part of

271
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,120
nato in the northern

272
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,199
geographical part of nato are speaking

273
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,160
already about

274
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,040
citizens resilience at the even more

275
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,759
micro

276
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,800
level the very fundamental cell of our

277
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
democratic societies

278
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,720
and you also see here this information

279
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
and fake news and everything which is

280
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:56,959
now

281
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,800
uh you know uh all over the place

282
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
so in a nutshell that's where i believe

283
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
i believe that nato and eu on resilience

284
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
we are natural

285
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,000
strategic partners on this one and we

286
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
stand ready

287
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,920
uh and i think this will be discussed

288
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
again between our two organizations in

289
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,880
the next few weeks

290
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,320
and i think resilience will be probably

291
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
one of the first topics will move

292
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,440
further in the strategic partnership

293
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,000
between nato and eu

294
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,519
thank you so much um let me now turn to

295
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,880
uh uh uh mother chefchovitch um

296
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,160
with uh i just want to highlight this

297
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,440
this one point uh that indeed as mercier

298
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,399
said

299
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,160
nato is an intergovernmental

300
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
organization it brings governments

301
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,959
together

302
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,399
but we're talking about national

303
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
prerogatives when it comes to all these

304
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:46,880
questions

305
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,759
uh tied to uh resilience and strategic

306
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,040
foresight and so on

307
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,800
well uh the european union is a

308
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,160
different animal

309
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,160
and um so so so my my entry question to

310
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,480
you to which you should then tag on

311
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
uh your own points uh is uh

312
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,240
what precisely are these instruments

313
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,839
that the european union and its

314
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,919
institutions the european commission

315
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,280
have to put into this effort

316
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,240
i think that uh also based on that

317
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,520
experience of the

318
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,839
of the last year i think it was quite

319
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,799
clear that

320
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
i would say such a basic tenants of the

321
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,880
underlying commission for the

322
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,439
for the period was that of course we

323
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,200
should uh

324
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,840
accelerate between green and digital

325
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,360
transition

326
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,640
but the kovid 19 crisis and i would say

327
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,520
clear

328
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,720
indication how suddenly you can disrupt

329
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,840
the global value chains how you know

330
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,880
you can really stop the the

331
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
successful operation of the internal

332
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,000
market because of the

333
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,720
border closures clearly demonstrated

334
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,120
that

335
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,280
to these two very important elements we

336
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,640
have to add the third one and this is

337
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,320
resilient so now we will see in all our

338
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
documents in all our policies in all our

339
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,600
strategies which we are putting on the

340
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,400
table

341
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,280
very clear reference to the resilience

342
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,440
which you now call strategic compass for

343
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
our policies

344
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,240
and of course it comes hand-in-hand with

345
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,640
the new portfolio which uh i'm honored

346
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,520
that uh

347
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
from the line decided to entrust me with

348
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,720
and this is the

349
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,039
the fourth side because uh we see that

350
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,400
this world

351
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
will not be less complicated in the

352
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,480
future i think we'll see more disruption

353
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,880
we

354
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,480
we see more uh dynamic uh changes we see

355
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,600
how the world is

356
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,320
becoming less multilateral more

357
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,240
multiplayer we see the geopolitics

358
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,679
geoeconomics play much much more

359
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:38,720
significant role than

360
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,520
a couple of years ago and therefore we

361
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,080
are

362
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,640
just looking at the foresight

363
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
anticipatory governance

364
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,559
and a very important tool for modern

365
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,559
governing and what i'm always

366
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,720
kind of telling and underlying to the

367
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,559
foresight community

368
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
that for foresight to be strategic it

369
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
must be politically relevant it must be

370
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,200
practical

371
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,880
and it must lead to the concrete

372
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
political decisions and therefore i'm

373
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,960
glad speaking about i would say the

374
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
institutional setup that uh

375
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,160
we've been working very well with the

376
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
portuguese presidency and just couple of

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,520
weeks ago we set up

378
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,440
the group of the ministers for the

379
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
future of course uh there was a joke set

380
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
i mean in that room

381
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,120
that so far we've met only ministers of

382
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,039
the past so now we have ministers

383
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,480
for the future and i think it's very

384
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,720
important because in each government you

385
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,120
need

386
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,840
to have somebody who would coordinated

387
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
this anticipatory policy he would look

388
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,960
on this uh

389
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,320
scenario building and see what might be

390
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,360
over the horizon

391
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
around the corner so it would be better

392
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,120
to prepare for that and uh come back to

393
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,840
mirchas point i think that uh this is

394
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
clearly i would say the contribution of

395
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,799
central and eastern europe because if i

396
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,320
look at uh

397
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,559
at romania the fact that we have now eu

398
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,360
cyber center

399
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,160
located in bucharest that romania

400
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,120
decided to go

401
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,000
for creation of euro-atlantic resilience

402
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,320
uh

403
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,679
center and also the fact that we are

404
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,760
discussing these topics here in brazil

405
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
it just shows that uh maybe because we

406
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
are more exposed

407
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
uh you know to the to the to the east

408
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:06,240
and to the

409
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,840
big neighbor to the east we kind of you

410
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,600
know perceive uh

411
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,480
the need uh to be at the forefront of of

412
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,679
this discussion and

413
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,159
for not speaking too long i would just

414
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:16,720
uh

415
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,200
mention one very important tool which

416
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,080
now

417
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,000
you will see being i would say

418
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,559
officially introduced in all member

419
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,080
states across the eu

420
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,000
and this is the 750 billion euros

421
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,200
which our president will be

422
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,320
announcing uh um i think uh we started

423
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,280
with portugal

424
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,280
now she's traveling to spain uh very

425
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
soon she will also will

426
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,200
be welcomed here in slovakia where

427
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,080
exactly

428
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,720
uh the green digital and resilient

429
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,440
policies

430
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,280
would be those sectors where the 750

431
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,640
billion euros should be should be

432
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,440
invested and that's i think one of the

433
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,120
very important tools we have at our

434
00:20:59,120 --> 00:20:59,919
disposal

435
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,600
because it comes with a combination of

436
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,360
the usual budget so we are talking about

437
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,799
1.85 trillion euros

438
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,799
uh and therefore i think this should be

439
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,159
indeed such a

440
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,480
european marshall plan moment when we

441
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,280
can prepare

442
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,760
our countries and our infrastructure for

443
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,200
the economic

444
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,280
economies and politics of the 21st

445
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,960
century and i'm sure that brazilians

446
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,159
will be a big part of it

447
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,240
thank you so much madras before i ask a

448
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,840
follow-up question let me remind the

449
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,799
audience

450
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,240
online and here in in the room

451
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,840
uh that you can ask questions via the uh

452
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,280
slido function of your globsec

453
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,559
app so um please go ahead

454
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,000
ask the first question and meanwhile

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,159
um let me let me um focus on this

456
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,600
uh on the foresight aspect

457
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,960
december 2019 uh i don't think

458
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
that the commission was planning for a

459
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,000
pandemic

460
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,600
or something uh now we have it

461
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,120
um what is the

462
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,960
you know and and this this was called

463
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
this is a so-called black swan

464
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,240
uh event a a disruptive

465
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
disruptive development which which is

466
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,919
not foreseen

467
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,600
what's the black swan uh event that you

468
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,600
would envisage uh right now i think that

469
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
this is always a bit of a it's a

470
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,200
misleading perception that

471
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,120
the good forsighters have a crystal ball

472
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,799
unfortunately we don't

473
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,919
but i think what is very important uh

474
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,679
to work with so-called scenarios so

475
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
currently we are monitoring uh

476
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,360
17 mega trends and see how they can

477
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,360
play into the future policies uh what

478
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,600
the the climate change will do with

479
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
migration waves

480
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,280
how the demography would impact the

481
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,640
economic performance

482
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,080
in europe what would be the the new

483
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,440
economic power centers

484
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,480
role in the future and where we want to

485
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,799
be

486
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,400
in 2030 in in 2050 and then

487
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,840
there is a technique which is called

488
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,760
back casting how from that

489
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,840
vision which we want to achieve uh

490
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,039
should come

491
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,320
to these days and really adopt

492
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,840
the policies which would bring us to

493
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,240
that preferred preferred scenario so i

494
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,120
think that

495
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
uh the the best black swans are those

496
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,360
which never materialized because we

497
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,880
anticipated them and therefore you never

498
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,919
heard of them

499
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,960
uh but the truth is that if we look in

500
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,679
the past be it financial meltdown

501
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,960
beat migratory crisis or be covered 19

502
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,559
i think there was writing on the wall

503
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,159
that something like this is happening

504
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,320
but the problem was that the foresight

505
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,799
community was kind of voicing that

506
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,720
this might have happened but it was kind

507
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,480
of inconvenient truth and there was not

508
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,240
political channel which could bring it

509
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,600
to the decision makers and

510
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,480
policy makers like please you leaders be

511
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,919
aware that something like this is coming

512
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,080
so this is what we are now

513
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,039
overcoming and making sure that this uh

514
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,720
horizon scanning or

515
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,080
you know the the the future uh possible

516
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,360
huge problems

517
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,039
uh will be communicated to the top

518
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,400
political level so we can

519
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,039
anticipate we can prevent it or we can

520
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,600
uh prepare decisions i think

521
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,559
of of course the obvious uh dangers in

522
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,840
the in the future

523
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,360
are cyber security climate change

524
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
migratory pressure and therefore we are

525
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,640
already uh

526
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,320
right now preparing adopting the

527
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,400
policies to to minimize the possible

528
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
negative negative fallout and that's uh

529
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,640
we do very closely with uh

530
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
with mirchia because we are working

531
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,799
together on critical infrastructure

532
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,640
on dual use of let's say transport uh

533
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
transport routes across the europe and

534
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,720
also on the future technologies on ai on

535
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,440
uh

536
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,799
screening of the foreign direct

537
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
investment we had just adopted a

538
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
new uh regulation in europe that every

539
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
foreign direct investment or 500

540
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,520
million euros will have to be screened

541
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
if it's not some kind of hidden agenda

542
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,919
behind it

543
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,559
and we invested a lot in uh strategic

544
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,919
autonomy my next

545
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,200
annual four-sided report would be

546
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,039
exactly about that the first one was in

547
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,600
resilience now we are going to focus on

548
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,960
open strategic

549
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,799
autonomy just simply to be better

550
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,720
prepared for this

551
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,520
harsh world of today excellent thank you

552
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,039
much thank you very much uh

553
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,840
can we do this slido poll now i would

554
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,720
like to give you

555
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,840
a multiple choice question

556
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,240
about who should take the lead in

557
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,120
strengthening

558
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,960
democratic resilience in europe and

559
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,960
please choose between four options

560
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,919
nato the european union national

561
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:42,799
governments

562
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,799
or civil society and

563
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,799
we're being very politically correct

564
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,039
here

565
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,039
so i'll give this a few more seconds

566
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,879
uh it's getting a little bit more even

567
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,200
yeah let's uh let's let's leave this

568
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,559
aside for a little bit and

569
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,679
come come back in a minute or so uh

570
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,640
but in the meantime um well turning to

571
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,919
miracea again

572
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,279
uh just very briefly uh with the more

573
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,679
classical heart security focused

574
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:22,799
question of

575
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,159
uh comparing the threats we face

576
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,320
from china and from russia what has been

577
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,000
the interplay between the two

578
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,120
recently um we all know that china has

579
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
never been mentioned as

580
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,440
often in a nato document as uh in the

581
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,279
last after the last summit

582
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,400
and uh so how how do you see

583
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,520
these two challenges uh evolving

584
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,679
for europe and for the west

585
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,279
listen the coming back just one second

586
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,279
to resilience

587
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:59,840
when we speak at nato the same thing the

588
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,480
eu

589
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,799
the same thing in national governments

590
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,240
sub-national governments or

591
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,320
civil society and our citizenry

592
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
when we speak about societal resilience

593
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,200
we speak about the

594
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,200
indispensable interconnection

595
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
on a permanent basis between government

596
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,600
public sector private sector and our

597
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
civil society and our citizens there's

598
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,120
no way

599
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,440
in the complex world we are living now

600
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
and this will become

601
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,200
an any foresight any potential futures

602
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,919
the plural are indicating that we are

603
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,559
the moment

604
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,039
of fantastic turmoil and global

605
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,960
realignment

606
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,279
this means that in nato the very

607
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,120
definition of security not only of

608
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,919
resilience

609
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,960
is broadening we have adopted that our

610
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,520
summit

611
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,679
an action plan on the security

612
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,679
implications of climate change maharaj

613
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,559
of course

614
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,640
in his foresight capacity for the

615
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,080
european commission

616
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,679
is actively looking into that we are

617
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,520
looking to the security implications of

618
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,320
climate change

619
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,279
and they are massive we are looking into

620
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,480
cyber

621
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,159
and again this is something which is

622
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,919
happening every day this was also a

623
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,840
dominant part of the

624
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
biden putin high level meeting yesterday

625
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,520
in geneva

626
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,840
and also our leaders at the nato summit

627
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,799
adopted

628
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,840
a new even more robust

629
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,520
nato cyber defense policy

630
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,919
we anticipate that global competition

631
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,440
and this is also relates to the rise of

632
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,399
china

633
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,520
and to the uh disruptive

634
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
way in which russia actions in many many

635
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,279
of this

636
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,559
multi-domain security conversation

637
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,760
is that outer space space is becoming a

638
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,559
place

639
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,360
of ever more intense global competition

640
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,840
this is why i was happy to sign with our

641
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,760
allies from luxembourg

642
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,000
a a new investment we have here in nato

643
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,840
headquarters in brussels where i'm

644
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,840
speaking you from on a strategic

645
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,520
oversight of space

646
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,360
activities that we are also working into

647
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,000
speaking of potential issues where also

648
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,720
china is

649
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,520
already playing a big role is not only

650
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
about global trade

651
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,840
and not only about supply chains and not

652
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,720
only about

653
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,760
fdi screening not only about 5g

654
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,720
and security but also to issues that we

655
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
are witnessing today and this will be

656
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,600
only even more intense competition in

657
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,640
the future

658
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,480
which is the competition for rare

659
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
materials

660
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,480
which is the competition of microchip

661
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,760
production

662
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,640
which is the issue of the european

663
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,480
commission and european union are doing

664
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,600
a fantastic pivot towards a different

665
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,200
kind of economic model

666
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
with green with more digital with more

667
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,120
resilient

668
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,679
this means that we'll also be witnessing

669
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,640
tremendous

670
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,200
transformations of our economic models

671
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,000
but also

672
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,399
we will be witnessing probably

673
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,039
additional

674
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,120
vulnerabilities for the new economic

675
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,240
model not only for the

676
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,159
old one or the current one that's why

677
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,679
the idea of the ministers of the future

678
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:10,720
i think is bright

679
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,760
living aside the the the self irony that

680
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,120
i see in maharashi's voice

681
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,080
on on on the definition of this so what

682
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,039
i'm just saying

683
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,840
that china's rise is one of the most

684
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,880
important moments

685
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,159
in in in in human history

686
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,919
it's not only the last decades i think

687
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,440
is the last five centuries

688
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,360
since the west has been dominating in

689
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,880
various incarnations

690
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,720
uh the world this is why for us in nato

691
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,760
keeping our technological edge investing

692
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,559
and adopting

693
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,240
technologies also when it comes to

694
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,600
defense and security

695
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,679
is something which is which is critical

696
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,960
for maintaining

697
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,360
uh our superiority and let me tell you

698
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,679
something which goes back to democracy

699
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,960
is this not only about economic

700
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,240
competition

701
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,600
or gdp uh or how much

702
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,440
defense spending you do they're all very

703
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,799
important they're part of

704
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,760
hard and soft power but in the end this

705
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,360
is a struggle

706
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,120
between democracies the need to improve

707
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,159
they need to be more

708
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,640
responsive to the criticism of our

709
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,519
citizens

710
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,840
on the way the state of affairs in our

711
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,679
societies in the political democratic

712
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,720
west

713
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,799
but nonetheless the competition between

714
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,279
democracy and authoritarian regimes

715
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,279
this is something that is the most

716
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,360
important and ethical fight

717
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,080
of our lifetimes for us in central and

718
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,240
eastern europe because we lived

719
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,000
at my age i lived half of my life in

720
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
communism half of my life

721
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,320
in freedom and democracy and for me

722
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,600
there is absolutely no

723
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,279
question about the vital interest

724
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,000
of us in the political west in europe in

725
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,760
north america with our democratic

726
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,039
friends all over the world

727
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,399
that we have to engage and fight and win

728
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,200
this fight

729
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,440
there is no way that somebody can

730
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,200
convince i think people from our part of

731
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,640
the world and i think from all over the

732
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,919
political west

733
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,559
that living in an authoritarian country

734
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,399
is better than living in a free open

735
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,519
society that having the right to choose

736
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,679
and get rid of your leaders through

737
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,120
democratic elections

738
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,159
is something that is less efficient uh

739
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,559
in in in the mid and long term than

740
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,760
authoritarian

741
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,200
never-ending you know personal uh

742
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,399
uh uh you know autocratic movements in

743
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,519
many other countries

744
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,159
so this is a very complex issue and if

745
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:32,559
you look

746
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,399
through this big big discussion we have

747
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,799
today you can also anticipate

748
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,840
uh in terms of foresight uh

749
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,320
not only the the eventual black swans

750
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,600
but also the grey

751
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,720
rhinos the things that are here and

752
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,480
after the lessons of the pandemic i

753
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,679
don't think we have the luxury

754
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,120
politically speaking

755
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,760
to ignore the signs of things that we

756
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,279
know are coming

757
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,120
and we have no absolutely really sorry

758
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,799
to interrupt at this point

759
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,279
but we're running short of time milsia

760
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,320
i'm so sorry

761
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,760
so the the the slido poll has evolved

762
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,720
democracies and i know i know i always

763
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,519
speak to too much

764
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,600
i so agree i mean it it hurts me more

765
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,799
than it hurts you

766
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,840
uh to interrupt at this point but uh so

767
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,360
this slider poll has evolved uh and the

768
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,200
the national governments have kind of

769
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,840
overtaken the rest

770
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,760
um but you know i think the most

771
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
important answer that i didn't

772
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,240
offer you of course is that all of the

773
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,120
above

774
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,279
obviously and that's what this session

775
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,240
is really about

776
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,679
it is about how we interact um

777
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,120
and the one of one of one of my uh

778
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,440
goals in this was also to emphasize

779
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,799
civil society

780
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,440
does play a role in democratic

781
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,279
resilience

782
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,480
and so can we can we just have short

783
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,960
short comments uh uh from uh from the

784
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,880
two speakers here on the

785
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,080
uh question of who does what yes i i

786
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,840
think that uh just to

787
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,360
uh kind of complement the the merchant's

788
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,480
response when yesterday we discussed

789
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,520
with uh

790
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,639
our president what was her main takeaway

791
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,760
from g7 from eu summit

792
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,480
she said that there was striking

793
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,639
consensus that uh

794
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,679
the leaders decided that it's even more

795
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,800
important than ever

796
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,679
to stand up for democracy so despite of

797
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,800
all the economic

798
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,639
uh defense future anti-talks

799
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,599
that was the main takeaway and i think

800
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,239
it just reflects

801
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,280
the the discussion we have here uh

802
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,839
today that the the feature and success

803
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,199
of our society

804
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,760
is based on democratic performance and

805
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,359
on democratic system

806
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,679
and let's be honest i mean democratizing

807
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,280
the democrats is under pressure i mean

808
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:53,839
if you looked

809
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,000
up through different statistics um

810
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,440
actually over the last five years the

811
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,960
number of democratic

812
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
countries in in in the world is not

813
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,000
growing but it's

814
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,440
it's uh it's uh uh coming uh

815
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,839
you know to the to the lower number so

816
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,599
it's a challenge which you have to

817
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,359
work with but nevertheless uh i would

818
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,880
say this clearly

819
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,839
stand up for democracy this i would say

820
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,200
very united

821
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,119
uh approach and why how this was

822
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,320
discussed it's

823
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,720
for me absolute sea change from uh

824
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
the discussions we had not so long ago

825
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,839
in munich when

826
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,599
ambassador richinger was talking about

827
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,920
restlessness so west is back

828
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,440
and it's good for democracy and it's

829
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,280
good for the people who are uh who are

830
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,000
living

831
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,560
in a democratic society and coming back

832
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,359
to your

833
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,079
questions who does what as you i think

834
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:42,560
as

835
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,079
as a people answered the questions i

836
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,160
mean that's a role for all of us

837
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,200
and i think uh here we never can uh

838
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,599
uh do uh enough because i think

839
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,240
that all of us have a role to play and

840
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,000
very often we are discussing the

841
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,960
question of

842
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,440
you know communication of the eu why

843
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,880
it's so difficult to understand our

844
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,119
policies why the people have a feeling

845
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,599
of

846
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,680
democratic deficit why very often the

847
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,880
perception of the

848
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,440
uh eu is not so glamorous as it should

849
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,079
be

850
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,560
and what i am saying is that it's very

851
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,359
difficult

852
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,680
to to talk over the heads of national

853
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,400
leaders

854
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,160
so what i want to say is that when we

855
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,160
are talking about democratic resilience

856
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,680

mitchell joanna

867
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,079
how would you align the threat

868
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,920
assessments and the national resilience

869
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,440
commitments in the two

870
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,320
strategic documents of the eu and nato

871
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,760
the strategic compass

872
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,599
for the european union the strategic

873
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,520
concept for nato so can you

874
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,640
just and really two minutes floor is

875
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,960
yours

876
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,320
listen uh the nato summit reconfirmed 30

877
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,119
allies and many of the leaders are also

878
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,359
leaders of eu member states they

879
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,720
reconfirm nato as

880
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,960
the prime platform for transatlantic

881
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,920
dialogue and political convergence on

882
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,839
everything relating to security

883
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,440
everything relating to security

884
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,359
including economic uh

885
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,440
issues including resilience including

886
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,520
many things that we have discussed

887
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,839
and let me come back to to what i

888
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,599
believe is the essence

889
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,599
of our conversation the resources

890
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,000
of the political west are finite by

891
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,440
definition

892
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,119
we are in an era of great power

893
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,880
competition and for the first time

894
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,480
we could god forbid not continue to be

895
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,680
number one

896
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,280
in terms of influence and and rules and

897
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,920
norms

898
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,400
we we propose to the world and the rise

899
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,280
of china is

900
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,359
a part of this conversation so when it

901
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,560
comes to

902
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,599
the political consequences

903
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,960
of this new global reality the political

904
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,599
consequences of the pandemic the

905
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,200
political consequences

906
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,119
of the realization here in the west

907
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,280
of the changes in the world there's no

908
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,800
other way

909
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,880
than for nato and eu to make sure

910
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,079
that the nato new next strategic concept

911
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:29,200
that will be ready

912
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,320
by the madrid summit in 2022 and the

913
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,480
strategic compass of the eu that will be

914
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,400
ready during the french presidency of eu

915
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
council

916
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,200
are converging and complementary not

917
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,680
identical but converging and

918
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,880
complementary

919
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,520
if we do this we are on the safe side of

920
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,920
history

921
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,960
thank you so much i think uh we could

922
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,359
continue this uh actually we should uh

923
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:55,920
in

924
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,680
uh talks in the corridors and then the

925
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,599
coffee break and and so on

926
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,480
but we have to wrap it up at this point

927
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:02,960
um

928
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,400
i think the the the decisive uh takeaway

929
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,839
here

930
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,119
is that it's it's a multi-pronged effort

931
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,920
nato and the european union will both

932
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,480
have to

933
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,640
will have to closely cooperate and they

934
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,720
will both have to play their respective

935
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,359
strengths

936
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,480
in a common effort to increase

937
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,520
strategic foresight for strengthening

938
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,599
resilience and the last thought that i

939
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,119
want to leave you with here

940
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,320
uh it is about democracy

941
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,560
versus authoritarianism this is the

942
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,160
overarching struggle

943
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,680
of the upcoming decade decades probably

944
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,960
pure plural that will

945
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,160
shape our era and the west

946
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,800
indeed stands a fighting chance in this

947
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,440
if we

948
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,640
stick together and we stay confident so

949
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,800
thank you so much for being here
