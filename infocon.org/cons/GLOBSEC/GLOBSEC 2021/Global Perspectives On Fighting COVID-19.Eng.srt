42
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,000
and and do you think of those questions

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,639
now um if you wait until the very end

44
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,280
to to take an opportunity then uh then

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,199
we might not get to your question

46
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,840
um and actually on that note to kind of

47
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
help everybody

48
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
get used to using the app um whether

49
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
you're online or not

50
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,400
um let's go ahead and and do a poll

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
this is your chance to weigh in to give

52
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,320
a review to europe

53
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
of how well it has handled the

54
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,759
coronavirus

55
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,199
pandemic so hopefully we can pull that

56
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,759
up for you

57
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,520
so how would you rate the eu's

58
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
performance on supplying vaccines

59
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,360
to eu citizens one is so one you know

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
it's on a scale of one to five so one is

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,840
terrible

62
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,240
and uh five would be excellent so go

63
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,960
ahead and

64
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
and weigh in and we'll we'll get back to

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,360
the results a little bit a little bit

66
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,400
later

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
um but um for now let's let's kick off

68
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,440
just actually looking at what happened

69
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
over the weekend the g7 met and uh

70
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,919
they announced that um they will be

71
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,720
donating

72
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,080
870 million vaccines to poorer countries

73
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,039
over the next 12 months meanwhile as our

74
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,479
presence here can attest

75
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,520
things are getting back to normal uh in

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,400
in wealthier countries and so um

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,080
suma actually let me let me start with

78
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,000
you over in london

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,199
you know what what do you make of this

80
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,520
870 million dose commitment is that is

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,479
that going to solve the problem

82
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,639
thanks very much sarah and nice to see

83
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,000
carl and marco as well

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
um i'm actually in oxford not london but

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,280
anyway

86
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,759
i'll forgive you for that um but look

87
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,840
it's a start but it's nowhere near

88
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,880
enough frankly this in terms of vaccine

89
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,520
sharing

90
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,440
we know all the analysis including by my

91
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
organization odi says that

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,199
we've really got the vaccination rates

93
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,280
up in the global south in order to solve

94
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,800
what is a global problem

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
and that requires both more vaccine

96
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,919
financing

97
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,319
vaccine sharing and work on vaccine

98
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,360
production too

99
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,759
but on the sharing side um look what the

100
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
g7 announced i think is

101
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,759
helpful but it's way way short of what

102
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,680
the imf or the independent panel on

103
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
pandemic preparedness

104
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,759
uh and response are saying is needed a

105
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,280
long way short and of course

106
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,880
with the syrian institute in india the

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,720
largest producer of vaccines also

108
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,800
only producing for domestic abuse to the

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,759
end of this year

110
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,560
the gap is enormous so i'm afraid i

111
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,080
don't really think this is

112
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,240
going far enough to solve the problem we

113
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,319
have

114
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
carl what's what's your take is it i

115
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,680
mean how do we

116
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,639
how do we get where we need to be no i

117
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,840
fundamentally

118
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
fundamentally agree i mean 870 i'm not

119
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
quite certain it was 870 that remains to

120
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,199
be seen there's always

121
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,560
a pledging conference of this sort

122
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,400
there's always an element of double

123
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
accounting

124
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,599
and delivery is what counts and delivery

125
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,520
is needed not next year but this year

126
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,039
these months in order to get it under

127
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:31,840
control

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,240
what we need really to bring the

129
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,800
pandemic under control by next year

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,240
is in the order of 11 billion doses

131
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,039
we have now so far roughly 2.1 billion

132
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,000
doses

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,759
that have been administered around the

134
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,840
world 80 85

135
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,720
of them in the witcher world if you take

136
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
the uh

137
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
low-income countries 0.2 percent

138
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
of people have been vaccinated there and

139
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,599
as we have learned

140
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,000
the problem if we go around in

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,479
bratislava or stockholm and belgrade

142
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,599
and think that the issue is solved

143
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,400
that is not the case now we are dealing

144
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,280
with the delta

145
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,840
variation i think that is going to be

146
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
dominant all over europe within weeks

147
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,319
because it is very much more contagious

148
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,160
than the previous ones

149
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
and i'm quite certain that if the

150
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,000
pandemic continues to

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,080
rage in wherever in the world peru is

152
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,319
among the worst at the moment

153
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,279
there will be new variations and these

154
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,440
don't know any borders they spread very

155
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,240
fast

156
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,440
so that is why it's so extremely urgent

157
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,320
to get vaccines and diagnostics and

158
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,000
treatments out to every

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,399
corner of the world because until

160
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,839
everyone is safe

161
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,560
no one is safe we are not saved in

162
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,839
practice larva

163
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,120
until we are safe in bangalore or

164
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,360
botswana or whatever

165
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
in the world so d7 lots of words

166
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,399
some promises good start but much more

167
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,399
is needed

168
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,320
thanks carl the other factor that we've

169
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,160
been seeing though is countries seem to

170
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
be a little unsure about whether

171
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,920
to give through kovacs which

172
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,959
is a mechanism set up by the by the

173
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,360
world health organization by gavi that

174
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,080
says

175
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,000
they will give to kind of distribute

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,080
vaccines equally around the world

177
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,680
um prioritizing health workers

178
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
prioritizing need on the other hand

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,959
many countries have said look maybe

180
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
we're ready to give away vaccines or or

181
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,680
sell vaccines but

182
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,120
we maybe want to get a little something

183
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,640
out of it ourselves we have some

184
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,560
diplomatic priorities and so vaccine

185
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
diplomacy has also emerged

186
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,080
and and marco serbia has has been

187
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,240
arguably a beneficiary of this uh you

188
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,160
know is vaccine diplomacy a good thing

189
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,760
or a bad thing

190
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
yeah that is really the case but if you

191
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,880
look at

192
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
the picture you know we are we were very

193
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,800
good

194
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,279
as a as a civilization to develop the

195
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,000
vaccine

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,959
which can efficiently with antibodies

197
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:10,800
fight the virus

198
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,519
but we are as a civilization as a world

199
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,480
society

200
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,680
so failing to reach

201
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,279
the same in the structural and

202
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,120
international and the policy levels

203
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,920
where we actually actually do whatever

204
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
we have done we have done

205
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
more or less wrong if you see serbia of

206
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,440
course

207
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,880
serbia as a non-eu member still and

208
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,320
with the opportunities to to to fight on

209
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,399
on our own as a small country with a

210
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,800
very simple decision-making process with

211
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,360
not

212
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,079
bureaucratic administration it was not

213
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:44,399
so

214
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,920
hard but it was not so hard because

215
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
the world as the global place the world

216
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,040
politics made

217
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,839
out of this actually a street fight to

218
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,279
be a street fighter

219
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,839
as a small country to be a street

220
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,399
fighter

221
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
fighter which is hands are not tied

222
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,640
it's much easier so actually what you

223
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,040
have

224
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,320
have done in serbia is that we started

225
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,399
many many months ago so year and a half

226
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,160
ago to to look

227
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,640
into the producers and to talk with them

228
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
directly to approach them to buy the

229
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,519
vaccines

230
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,399
at that time we had of course our talks

231
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,320
with the european union with the

232
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,000
decision makers in european union

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,160
and we saw how it gonna lead and how the

234
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,120
process will

235
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
will go so we said okay let's do it

236
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,600
everywhere because you know virus again

237
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,480
biologically if you see the virus is

238
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,079
coming to your lungs

239
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,959
then the antibodies attacks virus in the

240
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,600
lungs

241
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
if you see that we have a delta virus in

242
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,800
india

243
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
politically structurally you are not

244
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
attacking the india case

245
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
you're you're totally de-blocking the

246
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
the the

247
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,200
world parts which are the most infected

248
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,800
and this is you know that's what i'm

249
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,760
saying you know maybe we need more

250
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
biologists now leading the world than

251
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,200
the politicians

252
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,959
but the politicians have made some

253
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,240
interesting choices

254
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,639
with with regard to serbia we've seen

255
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,560
russia send quite a few vaccines in

256
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,399
we've seen china especially

257
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,440
supply vaccines how have you seen that

258
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,560
effect affect uptake both within serbia

259
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,800
and within the region as well

260
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,920
so basically what we would what the good

261
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
decision was is to say okay where we can

262
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,839
reach the next sense there's a chinese

263
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:26,959
there's russians

264
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,600
sputnik synonym there is astrazeneca

265
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,880
there is a pfizer

266
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,760
there is a moderna and you could as a

267
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,360
citizens in serbia

268
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,600
and later on the citizens of the region

269
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,480
you can choose

270
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,800
which vaccine you want to take and

271
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,760
dependent on this

272
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,519
it could be take one week or two weeks

273
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,040
or one month

274
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,600
until you are ready to be vaccinated and

275
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,720
that was a good

276
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,800
decision because you know the virus is

277
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,760
not

278
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
you know synovox or sputnik or astra

279
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,519
virus is a virus

280
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
so we have to we have to defeat him what

281
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,720
we then

282
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
discovered is that alone vaccinating

283
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,000
ourselves

284
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,959
in serbia is actually good but it's not

285
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,480
not preventing us it's not

286
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,120
helping us a lot let's do tried to do to

287
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,480
spread it on the on the region

288
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,560
so we organized as a chamber of commerce

289
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
uh vaccination of the business people

290
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,639
and then later of the old citizens from

291
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,760
the regional

292
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,519
uh of the western balkans but also from

293
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:20,959
croatia from bulgaria

294
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,079
anywhere so basically for us it was most

295
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,720
important

296
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,200
let's do that vaccinate as more people

297
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,560
as we can

298
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,079
to help and to start to live normally

299
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,320
we are not a part again of the european

300
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,279
structures

301
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,079
as much as we wanted to do to be so we

302
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,199
we have no

303
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,519
institutional umbrellas financial

304
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,880
umbrellas that they can

305
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
give us injection of money and and

306
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,320
capital and you know to overbridge the

307
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
situation we had to find

308
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,839
we were you know forced to find our own

309
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,240
way and this is maybe in this situation

310
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,320
good but this is the crisis situation

311
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,920
we now have to see how we can reach out

312
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,560
and

313
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,440
rebuild the the institutions what are we

314
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,639
what are the multilateral

315
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,720
resolutions are doing what do we need

316
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
for the climate change for the next

317
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
pandemic so and i'm very very thankful

318
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
to mr bilt who is now really

319
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
shaking the structures and this is what

320
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,320
we needed two years ago

321
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,040
three not now but maybe five years ago

322
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,920
but okay

323
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,560
nevertheless now thank you carl for that

324
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,199
so

325
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,839
really to shake up and to see people

326
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,480
it's not

327
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,959
about it's not about playing the games

328
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,279
it's not about playing the geopolitical

329
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,560
ngo strategy with the lives of billions

330
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,839
of people

331
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,519
carl no um

332
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,600
serbia has done it relatively rare i

333
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,440
sort of i freely acknowledge that no

334
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,800
question about it but

335
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,639
it doesn't really help serbia but it

336
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,320
doesn't help the world and and in my

337
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
opinion there's no way we can sort this

338
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,959
out in serbia

339
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,880
know where we can sort it out in in

340
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,560
europe we need to sort it out in the

341
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,279
world yeah

342
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,120
and and actually we need the global

343
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,519
institutions and i'm

344
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,079
i've ne to be quite honest i've never

345
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,839
been dealing seriously with these issues

346
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,040
before i've been dealing with things

347
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
like the balkans and

348
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
russians and god knows what that's a

349
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
mess in itself so we skipped that

350
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,519
a couple of months ago dr tedros called

351
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,360
me the director general of the world

352
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,959
health organization and said call i need

353
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,199
your help and i said well me

354
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
yeah i need someone who needs something

355
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,320
about international affairs and you

356
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,440
should now be

357
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
helping me to coordinate act a and i

358
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,199
said what's that day well act a

359
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,399
was set up april of last year by the

360
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,680
d70 and these 20 sorry

361
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,399
and and the eu in order to because at

362
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,160
that time they said

363
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,880
gosh something is happening we need to

364
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,199
get

365
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,160
everyone around the table so we set up a

366
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,600
coordinating mechanism

367
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,360
that brings together sort of the big

368
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,120
multinational actors the world health

369
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,560
organization primarily

370
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,320
but also the world trade organization

371
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,759
which is key in these particular

372
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,720
respects

373
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,279
then we have a lot of other actors like

374
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,320
sort of

375
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,639
garvey the vaccine alliance public

376
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,480
private safety that is developing

377
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,240
vaccines infide that is doing

378
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,600
diagnostics

379
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,720
big private actors i mean we have some

380
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
private global superpowers like gates

381
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,320
and

382
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,440
welcome all of these in a coordinating

383
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,000
network

384
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,399
never been done before and we meet every

385
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,519
week to say

386
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,160
this is what to do this is the challenge

387
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,600
this is what we're trying to do

388
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
yesterday we have announced an agreement

389
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
with the two leading manufacturers of uh

390
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,639
medical oxygen in the world to produce

391
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,480
an additional 2.2

392
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,800
million i think cylinders of oxygen

393
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,839
every day

394
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,480
because if if people that get oxygen

395
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,440
they die

396
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
they die and we've seen them dying in

397
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,759
numbers in india in latin america

398
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,240
in nepal and and then you bring everyone

399
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,079
around the table manufacturers

400
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,880
and ngos and government and try to do

401
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,440
that

402
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,480
has this been successful so far not well

403
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,000
it has been successful in the sense that

404
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,120
we've done a lot

405
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,319
um but i'm cautioning everyone we are

406
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:04,959
not

407
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,039
even at the midpoint of this particular

408
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,079
pandemic

409
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
and we don't know what's around the

410
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,119
corner

411
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,400
because we are not we are fighting a

412
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
living enemy

413
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,839
that is moving that is adapting that is

414
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,000
changing

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,799
and we know what we are fighting today

416
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,599
perhaps

417
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,280
we are not testing enough in my opinion

418
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,199
so it might be that there is something

419
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,640
that we have even today that we don't

420
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,079
know

421
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,080
but we can be fairly certain that we're

422
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,280
going to fight something else

423
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,160
three months from now and then we need

424
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,960
to have the

425
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
preparedness at the same time as we are

426
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,240
doing these things i'm not going to talk

427
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,280
too long but

428
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,080
we are starting to think of what happens

429
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,000
say that we by the end of next year

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,520
or in a good situation then we need to

431
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,880
think

432
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
are we really entering a new age of

433
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,840
pandemics because this might have been

434
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
the worst it was the worst

435
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,679
but we've had a number of them during

436
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,360
the last 20 years starting with source

437
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,720
we tend to forget that but we had a

438
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,679
number of them

439
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,160
and we didn't have action so is this

440
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
going to be the beginning of an age

441
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,880
epidemics

442
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,640
or are we going to be ready to set up

443
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
the international other institutions to

444
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,200
make sure that

445
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,160
we can prevent new pandemics and that's

446
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,520
going to be a very

447
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,120
major global challenge but first we have

448
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,799
to overcome this one

449
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,760
zuma i see i see you've been itching to

450
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,360
weigh in

451
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,919
politics is alive and kicking in the

452
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,799
vaccine

453
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,440
field as well i'm afraid the g7

454
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,160
committed

455
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,200
to support an act accelerator-led

456
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,640
process

457
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,799
to coordinate global vaccine supply

458
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,280
network and to try and optimize actually

459
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,039
manufacturing capacities but it's

460
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
completely short on concrete commitments

461
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,520
uh these g7 haven't got any concrete

462
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,640
commitments on this

463
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,080
and it's urgent to tackle those

464
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,480
bottlenecks in supply chain

465
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,799
of the pharma sector and expand

466
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,919
manufacturing capacity

467
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
uh worldwide secondly i mean i i'll read

468
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,640
your quote from the us

469
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,120
uh and run up to the g7 it said it was

470
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,200
going to use the g7 to rally the world's

471
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
democracies around solving this crisis

472
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,440
globally with america leading the way to

473
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,760
create the arsenal of vaccines

474
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,240
well uh what i note is the world's

475
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,520
biggest democracy india is

476
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,160
unable to export at all at the moment uh

477
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,039
to the end of the year

478
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,880
china has ramped up production of its

479
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,039
vaccines towards i think nearly 500

480
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:25,840
million a month

481
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,480
now and it's going to become the world's

482
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
largest vaccine producer

483
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,440
and may be actually able to supply

484
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,039
significant vaccine numbers

485
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,919
from far sooner than g7 and there won't

486
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,600
be explicit conditionality in this there

487
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,960
doesn't have to be

488
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,320
uh simply the fact that in an emergency

489
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,919
your sources of vaccine are coming very

490
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,080
much from a country like china

491
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,480
will make leaders of emerging markets

492
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,760
wake up take notice

493
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,280
realize who's supporting them in the

494
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
moment of crisis

495
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,679
the fundamental problem in this is what

496
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,360
serbia has done what the uk has done

497
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,039
what sweet everyone has done

498
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,360
is actually very rational at a national

499
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,480
level

500
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,960
but it's not rational globally that's

501
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,720
the problem we've got

502
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,200
so what we've failed to do i think is

503
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,919
align

504
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,080
the self-interest with the collective

505
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,360
global interest

506
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,880
and you saw that in the g7 summit i

507
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,400
think as well um

508
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,360
and you know i come from a country that

509
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,840
you know

510
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,720
decided to do a brexit uh despite the

511
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,480
economic consequences so i'm not going

512
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,159
to appeal just to the economic

513
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,480
arguments uh i think things like

514
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
lifestyle changes

515
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,640
for all of us in the advanced countries

516
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,400
will come unless we can get

517
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,640
vaccines shared properly with the global

518
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,679
south and that's what

519
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,320
carl i think and marco also say that's

520
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,840
the case that politicians in the

521
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,280
advanced countries need to make

522
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
to their populations and so far not

523
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,240
really being made

524
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
thanks and and you make a really

525
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,679
interesting point because we've been

526
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,240
hearing

527
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,280
this mantra that nobody is safe until

528
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,559
everybody is safe but

529
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,880
i think again we we all here who are

530
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,080
physically in this room

531
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
um see some of you in the audience

532
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
sitting close to each other not

533
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,000
necessarily

534
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,320
wearing masks we all we all seem to feel

535
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,879
pretty safe

536
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
and we look back at the aids epidemic as

537
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,760
well there's sort of a case was made 20

538
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,400
years ago

539
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,799
that this type of inequality was not

540
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,000
acceptable

541
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,720
and yet we seem to be back in in the

542
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,880
same place again so

543
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,640
are we gonna are we gonna start from

544
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,360
square one with every pandemic

545
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,159
carl well there's a risk of that but

546
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,000
that needs to be avoided

547
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,039
as you said i mean we had sauce we had

548
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,799
aids we had ebola we had h1 n1 we had

549
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:43,600
mers

550
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,039
there were as a matter of fact 11

551
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,960
different international high level

552
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,919
panels in order to say things are coming

553
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,200
prepare yourself

554
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
and the last and most significant of

555
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,919
them issued his report in november of

556
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:56,159
2019

557
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,840
one month before i hadn't read it

558
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,640
i was not even aware of it i was not in

559
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,480
positional responsibility at the time

560
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,360
but anyhow

561
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,039
i doubt there was any prime minister in

562
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,320
the world that had read that particular

563
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,080
report but if you read it in afterwards

564
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,480
it's it's all there it it's acid that

565
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
means that we need need to prepare much

566
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,360
better

567
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,080
uh in order to be ready for the next

568
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,720
because they're

569
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,240
quite a number of structural factors

570
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,600
that make it more likely that these

571
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,600
things will happen again

572
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
in terms of population explosion and

573
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,760
interaction between humans and animals

574
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,080
and

575
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,039
climate change and so so it's sort of

576
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,039
it's moving towards a world of pandemic

577
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,799
if we don't get a word

578
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,799
of much more intensify global

579
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,559
cooperation on global health issues

580
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,159
i'm saying that as a person who never

581
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,840
dealt with these issues i wasn't aware

582
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,600
of them before dealt with the classical

583
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,679
security of a global sick type

584
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,520
um but when we see these things

585
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,799
happening

586
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,320
i mean we have i don't know how many

587
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,880
have we 4 million dead

588
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,480
i i think the official figure is around

589
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
three million but that's a gross

590
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,880
underestimated we have fifteen thousand

591
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,320
dead in my country

592
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,840
and um and we still been lucky

593
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,799
because if we compare with sauce in 2003

594
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,320
this is far less deadly

595
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,840
far less deadly more contagious

596
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,080
but if we were to get something that is

597
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,480
as deadly as source and as contagious as

598
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,159
corvid

599
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,679
then we are in deep much much deeper

600
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,000
trouble

601
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
than we are today and it could well

602
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,919
happen if we don't learn the lessons

603
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,679
thanks carl marcos we you know you're

604
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,120
the president of the serbian chamber of

605
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,159
commerce

606
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,559
business thrives on stability obviously

607
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,600
this was deeply

608
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,480
destabilizing you know how how are

609
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,159
companies preparing for this

610
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,400
uh going forward so i think the

611
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,679
companies are now

612
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,039
much quicker and smarter than the

613
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,000
complicated complicated structures of

614
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,679
institutions if you see

615
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,760
more and more corporations are

616
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,960
introducing

617
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,080
obligationary vaccination in their

618
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
system so you cannot work

619
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,320
sorry if you're not vaccinated the

620
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,120
companies

621
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,080
if you see everybody is commenting about

622
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,200
a lot of

623
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,360
stocks buybacks from the companies it's

624
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
not only because of the cash

625
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
it is because of the preparation of the

626
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,880
vulnerable world

627
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
so of course as a company i am

628
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,799
considered consolidating my

629
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,080
equity to be able to cope with the new

630
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,960
challenges something which is really

631
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,760
really

632
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,080
logical uh thinking the companies are

633
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,799
also redefining how they trade

634
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,679
redefining the logistical networks uh

635
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,400
very very

636
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,279
quickly uh the states the governments on

637
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,799
the other side

638
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,720
are helping a lot of course in the

639
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,799
structure to to to help

640
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,640
to pump the money to to to make the

641
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,919
the crisis less dangerous that that is

642
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,159
but the answers of how we will cope the

643
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,120
next

644
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,919
stage there are no answers so if you if

645
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,159
you look just you look as a europe as a

646
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,039
company

647
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,600
so let let us let us forget this is

648
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,279
structure let us think about european

649
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,960
continent as a company

650
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,760
what do we have as depth ebitda ratio

651
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,880
huge

652
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,799
what do we have as our social expanders

653
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,000
and costs more

654
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,080
than any other company if we see china

655
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,120
and asia

656
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,919
if we see united states or other

657
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,080
companies

658
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,960
we will the economic dynamic of asia is

659
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,480
much stronger and much

660
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
livid than than european it will the

661
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,799
outcome of the asian economy will

662
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,039
surpass europe in a few years

663
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,760
uh if we continue to work like this

664
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,840
technologically competitiveness

665
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,600
we are lacking behind asia we are

666
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,480
lacking behind usa

667
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,159
if you see education look overview the

668
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,159
list of the educational institutions

669
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,880
and the top ratings you will find maybe

670
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,520
uk

671
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,679
okay but that's it in the european

672
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,600
continent you will not find

673
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,240
the biggest and the more you know top

674
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,799
ranking

675
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,720
top ranking institutions what is about

676
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,400
the fintech what is about so

677
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
there is a lot of issues where i will

678
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,640
ask carl are you

679
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,799
ready to invest as a company in europe

680
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,400
as a company if you be

681
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,840
investor i don't know i think we need

682
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,240
a strong investment fund which will come

683
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,520
to europe

684
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,760
and and you know restructure ourselves

685
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,520
because i'm talking this

686
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
as somebody who is still not a member of

687
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,520
you but very integrated

688
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,200
very very integrated in the european

689
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
economy you can be eu or you cannot be

690
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
you but you are part of your community

691
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
economical network economical network of

692
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,840
europe

693
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,559
and i tell you this looking from this

694
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,039
down

695
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,000
you know a smallest fish i see really

696
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,279
all the problems

697
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
that we are now facing and this is not

698
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,520
easy to solve and this is how what we

699
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,559
have to rethink

700
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,080
and this is not only about

701
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,520
redistribution of vexes we have to think

702
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,440
uh about technologies we nobody sells

703
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,520
okay how the our large we as a europe we

704
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:01,840
are

705
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,559
company which is oriented as exporter

706
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,480
you agree so we have to export

707
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
to other markets to big markets to other

708
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,279
companies as india for example

709
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
we have to export to africa we have to

710
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,960
export to china we have to export to

711
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,080
united states

712
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,200
and how they will cope these markets

713
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,720
with their challenges are we helping are

714
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,320
we not having technology

715
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
vintage uh distribution of predictions

716
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,360
of uh and

717
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,640
and introducing of uh ai technologies in

718
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,679
these countries

719
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,159
uh healthcare digital healthcare so

720
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,159
these are the questions that we also

721
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,240
have to deliver

722
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,039
and to export to these markets in order

723
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,240
to have these markets

724
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
in the same capacity that we want to

725
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,159
have them because we depend on these

726
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,600
markets

727
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
we want to admit it or not but we depend

728
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,720
on it

729
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,559
well if europe is a business uh we all

730
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,480
had our chance to do our our yelp our

731
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,279
google review

732
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,960
in our slido poll so let's um let's see

733
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,320
the results of of uh

734
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,679
how folks feel europe did all right

735
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,840
very very middling there's strong

736
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,600
consensus that uh

737
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,159
that you have had a mediocre performance

738
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,279
on supplying vaccines to eu citizens um

739
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,679
so um for we're about about midway

740
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:16,480
through so

741
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,440
um i'll i'll check with the audience to

742
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:19,840
to

743
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,480
see if there are any questions um in the

744
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,799
room

745
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,679
all right i don't see any um

746
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,919
so reminder to to get your questions

747
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,960
ready here or

748
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,559
submit a question on slido

749
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,159
but zuma let me

750
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,840
let me ask you we one of the discussions

751
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,279
that came up um

752
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,840
uh uh made especially articulately by

753
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,919
the the croatian president earlier

754
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,080
today is this idea that a lot of these

755
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,960
restrictions

756
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,000
were imposed um

757
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,679
the health restrictions were imposed

758
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,440
without necessarily a lot of consent

759
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,200
from the populist it might have been

760
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,880
you know driven by experts not

761
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
necessarily done in some sort of

762
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,399
authoritarian pursuit but

763
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,440
you know how how do these

764
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,559
these restrictions affect um

765
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,039
economies and and kind of the citizens

766
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,320
relationship to their economies

767
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,559
well what we've been seeing for last 15

768
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,440
months as a classic

769
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,640
liberty versus safety uh argument and

770
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,159
you get this

771
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,399
during war time and you also get this in

772
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,159
this current situation

773
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:33,919
and um each countries had to make its

774
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,840
own decisions on this but clearly the

775
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,760
economic impact has been enormous

776
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,840
um you know uh just across every single

777
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,600
um advanced economy but all the

778
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,520
middle-income countries that i know of i

779
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,559
think only

780
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,919
two of the ones that we used to work on

781
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,440
they've actually managed positive growth

782
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,039
are rather surprising uzbekistan being

783
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:51,760
one of them

784
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,760
but like plus one percent or something

785
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,240
compared with their target was plus 10.

786
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,399
so basically the world economy has been

787
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,480
very badly hit and one of the

788
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
big issues is how quickly we'll recover

789
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,000
there will obviously be a bounce back

790
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,440
immediately but there'll be interesting

791
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,039
issues like supply chains

792
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,960
haven't been disrupted whether people

793
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,159
will go more local

794
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,200
rather than uh you know global

795
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,320
with a chinese uh participation in those

796
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,919
global supply chains will also be you

797
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,360
know one of the issues that

798
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,000
countries face up to lots of interesting

799
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,880
questions

800
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,559
i think the thing we haven't discussed

801
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,000
and i would like to put it on the table

802
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,559
is institutional change i think we've

803
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,159
talked about vaccine sharing financing

804
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:31,360
and so on

805
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,600
but a big issue for me it seems to me

806
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,960
and it's one that i'm working on as part

807
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,159
of the wh sho

808
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,120
pan european commission it's uh chaired

809
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,480
by mario monti the former

810
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,720
italian prime minister is looking at

811
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,000
what sort of institutional change do we

812
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,840
need for exactly what carl said

813
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,200
this is not going to be the last

814
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,520
pandemic this will come back if you

815
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,799
model all the others

816
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,799
they all came back in somewhere another

817
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,159
and so how do we risk the

818
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,080
reduce the risk of future pandemics and

819
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,600
combat them more effectively

820
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,679
as it happens we have got lessons from

821
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,039
other global public bands

822
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,279
like climate change like the financial

823
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,399
crisis

824
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,120
uh we did make institutional change in

825
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,480
case of climate it took

826
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,559
more than 20 years from the stockholm

827
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,120
summit in 72 to the rio 1 in 92

828
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,640
before changes started happening

829
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,240
financial crisis actually responded

830
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,760
much more quickly so what we're going to

831
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,360
recommend almost certainly

832
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,720
in this primary operating commission is

833
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,640
first of all we do need an international

834
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,840
scientific committee

835
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,080
on health threads modeled on the climate

836
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,919
change scientific committee

837
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,000
we do need to improve and strengthen the

838
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,440
surveillance of health systems

839
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,600
which probably means more of a

840
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,799
compulsory

841
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,200
involvement by wh so bit like the imf's

842
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,080
article 4

843
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,399
surveillance to look at health systems

844
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,080
and to look at their linkage with food

845
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,919
and agriculture animal health

846
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,519
those sorts of things and there was some

847
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,120
element of this in the g7

848
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,720
declaration actually which is that part

849
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,200
of it was welcome i think this weekend

850
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,600
um we also should create in our view a

851
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,519
g20 global health board modeled on the

852
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,200
financial stability board

853
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,360
um this would identify failures in the

854
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,720
provision of

855
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,320
global goods like vaccines and so on

856
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
and help with preparedness and response

857
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
as well

858
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,039
and also we need to ramp up investment

859
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,200
in global public goods for example

860
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,799
reasons marco said

861
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,399
uh this is actually it's really

862
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,519
interesting if you look at really

863
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,399
interesting worrying

864
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,159
if you look at multiple development

865
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,080
banks like the one i lay dbrd

866
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,159
the amount of financing in the in this

867
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,519
area is very low

868
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,440
actually relative to other types of

869
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,640
global goods

870
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,640
uh so i you know we're thinking that we

871
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
should recommend that kovacs

872
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,679
becomes a permanent mechanism that uh

873
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,600
much more investment in health systems

874
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,440
in r d and innovation

875
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,039
by the multilateral development banks

876
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,640
and others

877
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,320
that i think has to accompany

878
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,840
institutional change

879
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,440
otherwise the new institutions won't

880
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,200
have the firepower to deal with these

881
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,960
things so we'll have to have a duality

882
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,440
of

883
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,760
institutional change and reform modeled

884
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,000
on climate change and financial crisis

885
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,080
but dealing with pandemics plus huge

886
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,919
scale up of investment from multilateral

887
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,440
organizations in particular

888
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,360
to help particularly emerging markets uh

889
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,600
cope with this in future

890
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,039
seem if i could just push back on you a

891
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,960
little bit kovacs has not really been

892
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,120
seen as a success so far so

893
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
why should we make it permanent well

894
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,840
because it needs to become a success

895
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,559
it's not the

896
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,399
it's not the fault of the actual model

897
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:20,720
in my view it's i'm afraid it's the

898
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,600
issue with um the main financiers of the

899
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,080
model

900
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,799
and the suppliers it's uh so it's a

901
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,519
mechanism

902
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,760
that uh i think it's gonna have to

903
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,799
mature and succeed but i think it can do

904
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,760
provided its uh key participants

905
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,399
actually

906
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,000
really commit to doing so over a long

907
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,320
period they might find it easier to

908
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,760
commit over a longer period

909
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,120
than over the short term because of

910
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,279
their own fiscal issues

911
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,440
so that's why i think it's the best game

912
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,000
in town i think we should build on it

913
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,919
carl do you do you agree do you think it

914
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,519
will be easier to make the longer term

915
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,320
case and

916
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,919
and have you figured out a pitch that

917
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,840
will that will convince

918
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,519
um uh other european and and

919
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,200
and the other european countries in the

920
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,679
u.s to to pony up more

921
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:08,320
well i i hope that we can get them to

922
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,520
sort of contribute more

923
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
immediately in terms of money and

924
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,359
vaccine sharing that remains to be seen

925
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,960
but that that that is ongoing work but

926
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,399
then i very much agree with whom are

927
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,159
there sort of the agenda that he spells

928
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,560
out

929
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,119
and i i can add quite a lot to it on

930
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,839
what is

931
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,399
needed to do thereafter in order to set

932
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,918
up new international mechanisms i mean

933
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,199
we need a sort of

934
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,639
they're quite a number of reports on the

935
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,560
table already

936
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,159
and and we're going to have a special

937
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,599
session of the world health assembly in

938
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,480
november

939
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,560
to deal with these issues in pandemic

940
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,280
treaty and a sort of pandemic radar or

941
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,079
surveillance systems and financial

942
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,918
resources immediately available so we

943
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,359
can order vaccines

944
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,440
not after three months but after three

945
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,359
days

946
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,239
so that we can fully fund or supply the

947
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,839
korvax i mean korvax is an excellent

948
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:54,560
idea

949
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,480
but i mean if you should distribute

950
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,560
vaccines you need to have vaccines

951
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,320
and and even if we are now ramping up

952
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,160
production of vaccines like sort of a

953
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,680
historical

954
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,680
dimensions we face a lot of problems

955
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,839
i mean we fade trade restrictions we

956
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,160
fail in the face vaccine nationalists

957
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,720
we've

958
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,440
placed some supply constraints so there

959
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,280
are lots of lessons to be learned in the

960
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,800
middle of us dealing with crisis

961
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,119
management as we are doing on a

962
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,200
daily or weekly basis in order to fight

963
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,160
this

964
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,800
we need to sort of start to add up the

965
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,520
long agenda the long list of things

966
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,839
that needs to be done and decided next

967
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:32,800
year

968
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,160
when we hopefully are in a better

969
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,079
situation to prevent this from

970
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,359
from recurring and that europe plays a

971
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
role needless to say

972
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,359
uk is an important actor not only

973
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:44,960
because of g7 but there's

974
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,640
other reasons as well china

975
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,599
russia i mean we all of the other

976
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,640
battles that we fight

977
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,599
must be sort of put aside for the battle

978
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,960
against the virus

979
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,880
and setting up those particular

980
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,560
structures

981
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,280
that's a great segue actually to to one

982
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,079
of our

983
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,440
one of our questions that came in

984
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,680
through through the app um

985
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,280
and uh it's from i'm so sorry i'm gonna

986
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,560
mispronounce this name

987
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,839
uh nanada nezhevsky

988
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,359
i'm sorry i seriously apologize but

989
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,640
anyway the question is

990
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,400
vaccine manufacturers do not want to

991
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,480
share vaccine production with others and

992
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,720
invoke the right to patent protection

993
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,480
but is it actually some kind of monopoly

994
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,280
that's in my opinion wrong they are

995
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,640
sharing vaccine production

996
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,880
on a i don't have the numbers but i

997
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,040
think we have 20 or 30 or 40

998
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,800
technology sharing agreements i mean

999
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,560
most of production is outsourcing to

1000
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,280
other

1001
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,320
vaccine manufacturing at the moment the

1002
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,680
problem that is there

1003
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,440
is often a problem now of sort of

1004
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,839
manpower

1005
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,280
of uh sufficient quality control if you

1006
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,800
do it it's too fast

1007
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,640
you lose i mean these are complicated

1008
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,920
things

1009
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,520
i mean it's not that you do it at home

1010
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,680
in the kitchen to put it mildly

1011
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,800
uh one sort of

1012
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,480
stock of vaccines that you do takes

1013
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,079
roughly three months it's a biological

1014
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:10,720
process

1015
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,760
you have a hundred quality checks and if

1016
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,440
things go wrong as we saw at

1017
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,560
example at a big facility in baltimore

1018
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,079
everything is destroyed and there will

1019
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,400
be tens and tens of millions of

1020
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
doses that also destroyed in that

1021
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
particular

1022
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,040
small mistake in baltimore but we have

1023
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,720
sort of outsourced vaccine production

1024
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,320
all over the world

1025
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,000
with the speed that is unprecedented if

1026
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,880
we take this sort of

1027
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,800
intellectual property issue that could

1028
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,560
be discussed

1029
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,079
but that's going to take a long time to

1030
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,920
have an effect

1031
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,880
i mean if if one lifts those particular

1032
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
protections

1033
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,640
and start to build greenfield factories

1034
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,320
for vaccine production start to recruit

1035
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,520
and train people

1036
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,680
you will have an effect in on supply in

1037
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,280
say two years time

1038
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,280
that's nice in two years time

1039
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,320
i'm not going to say that we're all

1040
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,160
going to be dead but that's to

1041
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
exaggerate but i mean it's it's it's now

1042
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,960
that we need it and then we have to deal

1043
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,920
as donald rumsfeld said you have to

1044
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,839
fight the war of the day with the army

1045
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,599
that you have

1046
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,200
and we have to fight this particular

1047
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,040
pandemic with the

1048
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,520
the instruments that we have marco you

1049
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,079
want to

1050
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,000
weigh in after we've heard the words of

1051
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,400
the uh former george w bush's defense

1052
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,200
secretary

1053
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,839
go ahead no i i just wanted to say that

1054
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:30,480
you know

1055
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
i think the best recommendation for carl

1056
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,480
for this new job was that he you know

1057
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,400
has to deal with balkans you know if you

1058
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,240
can't deal with balkans the viruses

1059
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,880
nothing

1060
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,520
so basically maybe who knows but but i

1061
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,040
totally i totally agree with that i

1062
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,359
would

1063
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:46,720
what i think is that

1064
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,599
if you i'm happy that political leaders

1065
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,200
in my country president and prime

1066
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,160
minister

1067
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,119
they told out of the box and they was

1068
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:55,680
able to

1069
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,440
to think out of the box but i'm not a

1070
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,800
happy man if this is not

1071
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,000
leading to improving the box because you

1072
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,960
know

1073
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,359
it's it's not a good game uh thinking

1074
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,440
out of the box is always good

1075
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,240
if you have the box so let us think

1076
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,440
about the box and then

1077
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,400
if you see the 80s uh you know the last

1078
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,200
century

1079
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,880
i i totally remind me the whole

1080
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,280
vaccination uh

1081
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,440
race is is actually and not only

1082
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,280
vaccination but the whole corona race

1083
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,520
is actually reminding me on the 80s and

1084
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,520
trying to settling the arm race we

1085
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,800
need to deal like this we need to sit

1086
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,880
down and say hey international rules

1087
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,960
has to be established if i want to build

1088
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,640
a factory in any of country

1089
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,119
including serbia for the production i

1090
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:41,680
will

1091
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,520
have to fight with the same building

1092
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,440
permits bureaucracy

1093
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,560
as anywhere in the world and it will not

1094
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,040
you know who cares if it is for the

1095
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,920
vaccine of its

1096
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,839
for for anything else i will have to

1097
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:58,079
fight the old bureaucratic issues if i

1098
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:58,880
want to go

1099
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,960
to testing and so on so we have to to

1100
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,560
find international rules

1101
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,720
which are obliged for everybody and that

1102
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,680
is not the case

1103
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,760
and not a question if you're in china or

1104
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,200
in russia or in the states

1105
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,000
but we you know this is the only way to

1106
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,400
to

1107
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,240
to scope with that and this is actually

1108
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,760
improving the box

1109
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,480
i think so so this is basically what we

1110
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:18,960
need

1111
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,000
really to think about it how we will

1112
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
manage it to rebuild the box

1113
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,920
in the way that you know we are able to

1114
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,680
do to face the challenges

1115
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,200
because they are here we are not you

1116
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,800
know this we are not speaking now it's

1117
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
about something which is in the future

1118
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,440
we are speaking about you know you see

1119
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,880
the people with the masks and and

1120
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,520
everything so

1121
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,760
i i spent two and a half hours just to

1122
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,560
come in

1123
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,560
and to register for this you know i was

1124
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,160
like zoom come back

1125
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,960
everything is forgiven i like you so but

1126
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,000
nevertheless we

1127
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,720
we managed it somehow and now i think we

1128
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,880
have to if we tend to really really

1129
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,040
think about how we will do it in the

1130
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,560
future and

1131
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,359
you know there are a lot of questions

1132
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,720
how

1133
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,920
will the industry 40 look like in the

1134
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,720
future

1135
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,280
are we able to transfer the technologies

1136
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
to other markets which are not able on

1137
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,160
themselves

1138
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,119
to have these solutions now it's not

1139
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:15,839
only

1140
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,319
vaccine patents rise it's i totally

1141
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,440
agree with the

1142
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
this is the the framework of now but

1143
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,119
what is the framework do we have an

1144
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,119
answer of this framework do we have the

1145
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,240
something that we we will exchange this

1146
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,960
framework

1147
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,240
i don't see this kind of discussion

1148
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,920
all right i'm going to give um zuma the

1149
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,359
floor and just give a heads up to

1150
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,960
the folks um on the floor that we do

1151
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,720
have a question um

1152
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,839
there so uh let's get the the mic over

1153
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:42,800
to that person

1154
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,960
but but zuma can you can you weigh in

1155
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,400
you know this discussion of a twit trips

1156
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,960
waiver is

1157
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,440
is is quite a fiery one and it was

1158
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,040
implied by our last question

1159
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,800
uh where do you stand there i'm in favor

1160
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,160
of a waiver

1161
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,839
um i think we've got to do everything we

1162
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,000
can to get vaccine production up

1163
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,079
and i think the waiver is a part of the

1164
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,680
arsenal of instruments

1165
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,880
to try and do that but carl's right um

1166
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,599
in all wto discussions that i've ever

1167
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,400
been involved with

1168
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,240
um this is not like an overnight

1169
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,560
decision to try and build a consensus

1170
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,079
for that will take some months

1171
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,920
and we haven't got months to wait so

1172
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,680
that can only be one of the instruments

1173
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,879
more a medium term one i think

1174
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,880
all right thank you and let's go to our

1175
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,400
question on the floor please

1176
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,240
please stand up

1177
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,400
border and coast guard uh thank you so

1178
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,640
much uh european border or any border

1179
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,079
management hasn't really been mentioned

1180
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:36,960
so far

1181
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,200
i was wondering about your perspectives

1182
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,319
um

1183
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,079
if we do accept that we're not even

1184
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,560
halfway there we do also probably know

1185
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:44,960
that

1186
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,680
um more variants will come about where

1187
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,599
does european border management come in

1188
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,280
from the serbian perspective what does

1189
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,880
that mean for your business or

1190
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,720
the uk i mean we already have this

1191
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,000
dynamic right now

1192
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,839
thank you so much

1193
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,440
well i think that uh if you talk about

1194
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,040
sort of connectivity and we are a far

1195
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,640
more connected world these days

1196
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,000
i mean that we can manage that i mean

1197
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,839
all of us most of us who have come here

1198
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,280
or those of us who come by

1199
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,520
by air for example i mean you have to

1200
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,560
test before you go

1201
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,000
on the aircraft and sometimes when you

1202
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,359
get off the aircraft i mean that's

1203
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,119
perfectly possible to do

1204
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,880
and and and we have sort of new testing

1205
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,560
equipment and new testing technologies

1206
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,079
that are coming that are sort of

1207
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,119
both easier to do and and cheaper

1208
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,000
so i i think we can make the air traffic

1209
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,560
global air traffic system

1210
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,960
safer i mean nothing's hundred percent

1211
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,480
but more or less hundred percent that's

1212
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
that's doable um

1213
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,000
borders i mean we have other flows of

1214
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,839
migration across borders that we can't

1215
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:47,040
control anyhow that

1216
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,920
that's a challenge but uh the more

1217
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,599
testing i

1218
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,520
could make that note a lot of discussion

1219
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,119
about vaccines i understand that all of

1220
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,960
the politics is about vaccines

1221
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,680
i stress testing testing testing because

1222
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,599
if we don't test we are flying blind we

1223
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:03,440
don't know what's happening

1224
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,040
if we know what's happening then we can

1225
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,119
take action so if we test

1226
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,319
far more on your borders uh

1227
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:11,760
then we know what's happening and that

1228
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,560
we can take actions i i i'm not

1229
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,400
entirely pessimistic on the possibility

1230
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,520
to handle that challenge

1231
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,440
if you ask about the borders and i will

1232
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,040
return to my

1233
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,960
company metaphor on the european

1234
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,400
companies we

1235
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,200
are becoming expensive our transaction

1236
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,880
costs are becoming expensive

1237
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,880
our logistical costs are becoming

1238
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,000
expensive it

1239
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,480
has not to do only with serbia or or

1240
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,280
croatia

1241
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,400
or or denmark it's about transaction

1242
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,560
codes with the euro zones non-eurozones

1243
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,119
between europe and non-eu countries or

1244
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,240
emerging europe

1245
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,400
it is the logistical cause between the

1246
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,599
european countries

1247
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,760
so uh basically what are the answers

1248
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,040
from that so the businesses

1249
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,040
what they can do is they can only do

1250
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,079
what they can do

1251
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,240
we are thinking about the new logistical

1252
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,760
uh approaches

1253
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,000
using more rivers using more vertical

1254
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,520
harbors on the seaside

1255
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,880
so trying to cope with these challenges

1256
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,920
but again i don't see any discussion

1257
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,319
how we will face this problem because it

1258
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,280
will

1259
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,000
shape our economy it will make us

1260
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,680
uncompetitive

1261
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,440
in the world where other large companies

1262
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,240
have no problem with assessing the the

1263
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,119
markets

1264
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,680
everywhere in their on their part of the

1265
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,640
of the of the

1266
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,200
interest zone so basically this is a

1267
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,040
huge question the borders are the huge

1268
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:35,680
question

1269
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,640
are we ready to introduce single markets

1270
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,920
also to the countries

1271
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,079
which are on their way to europe and

1272
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,599
which are establishing the european

1273
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:44,720
standards like the

1274
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,520
western balkans minishang and everything

1275
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,599
uh as a european union even before

1276
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,599
the western balkans is able to become

1277
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,720
politically full member

1278
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,400
are we ready to do that or not i don't

1279
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,079
know yeah i i

1280
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,599
read a i read a piece that you wrote

1281
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,440
recently where you kind of

1282
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,400
saw vaccine diplomacy as a possible path

1283
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,040
to

1284
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,119
to creating this western balkans mini

1285
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,720
schengen

1286
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,640
how's that going and especially given

1287
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,240
that kosovo has said

1288
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,480
they don't want serbian vaccines because

1289
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,839
most of the serbian vaccines are from

1290
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:14,480
russia

1291
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,200
and and china and china those countries

1292
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,680
don't recognize kosovo as a country so

1293
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,440
how are you navigating all this no i can

1294
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,040
fully understand the people uh

1295
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,119
you know that was the time when the the

1296
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,960
government in krishna was

1297
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,920
not even built and a pretty tough time

1298
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,040
for them but

1299
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,839
we had thousands of entrepreneurs from

1300
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:34,720
kosovo

1301
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:36,720
vaccinated in serbia the companies from

1302
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,400
kosovo vaccinated in serbia

1303
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,920
which is not a problem we are not

1304
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,920
looking at as a as a political issue

1305
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,520
it's a humanitarian issue

1306
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,160
and you know this is the question if the

1307
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,880
russians are

1308
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,119
you have to choose nobody actually the

1309
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,520
most given vaccine in this regional

1310
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,760
business vaccination project that we had

1311
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,560
is astrazeneca and beyond tech pfizer i

1312
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,200
think

1313
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,599
and then after that xenofarm so you

1314
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,480
could choose

1315
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,200
it's not a problem but diminishing in

1316
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,640
the question of the region

1317
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,680
will be solved so we will fail or we

1318
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,200
will succeed together with the european

1319
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:11,760
union

1320
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,400
we can be achieved now in this hard

1321
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,680
times to have

1322
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,640
waiting times on the borders for trucks

1323
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,839
under one hour

1324
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,079
or one hour and a half and but in

1325
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,040
between our

1326
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,200
borders of the west balkan but if you

1327
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,160
come to the

1328
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,960
eu border this is eight hours 10 hours

1329
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,000
12 hours

1330
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,520
so there is no answer only between

1331
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
us in the militia it is the answer

1332
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,720
between us

1333
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,119
and the single market are we ready to

1334
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,480
that

1335
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,440
are do we want to to to build the

1336
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,760
project of european success

1337
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,119
uh further or what we

1338
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,920
want actually from europe i think this

1339
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:52,480
basic

1340
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,040
basic ideas and basic discussions what

1341
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,960
we want from europe actually

1342
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,960
is also somehow needed to be done

1343
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,480
suma you talked about how how um

1344
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,760
you know china and others are kind of

1345
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,000
coming in with with offers

1346
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,960
for this region so you know do you think

1347
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,800
the pandemic has brought the western

1348
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,760
balkans

1349
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,160
uh closer to europe or further from

1350
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,280
europe

1351
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,839
and we only have a few minutes left so

1352
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,440
western balkans

1353
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,680
well i mean i hope it's brought western

1354
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,680
balkans closer to europe um

1355
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,240
but that's been my lifetime's uh

1356
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,680
objective to try and get europe and the

1357
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,280
western balkans much closer together

1358
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,599
look i think um what marco has just said

1359
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,119
is really instructive i think there's a

1360
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,319
division between

1361
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,800
goods and services if you like and

1362
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,319
between physical non-physical i think

1363
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:41,760
the physical side of

1364
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,200
goods and services they're huge

1365
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,040
transaction costs and probably the

1366
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,079
pandemic is

1367
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,079
actually increase those transaction

1368
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,319
costs and the big focus should be on how

1369
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,160
digitization others can actually reduce

1370
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,599
those transaction costs

1371
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,119
so that you know human beings less

1372
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,119
involved in the actual transactions as

1373
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:57,599
such

1374
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,920
across borders on the non-physical i

1375
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,280
think the service sector i think can

1376
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,559
continue pretty much because it's well

1377
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:03,440
digitized

1378
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,520
and doesn't really require human to

1379
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,280
human contact to some extent

1380
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,800
the people side is going to be

1381
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,119
interesting i think i don't know whether

1382
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,640
lifestyle change will mean that there'll

1383
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:15,200
be less tourism uh foreign tourism

1384
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,599
for a while at least um because people

1385
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,480
are suspicious

1386
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,800
um you know even in the uk it's

1387
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,319
remarkably easy

1388
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,319
to get uh booking in portugal even when

1389
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,440
it's not a green

1390
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,000
green country um because people are just

1391
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,599
not moving people are not just going

1392
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,160
actually

1393
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,200
as much as we thought they would and i

1394
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,040
think also in terms of for work

1395
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,720
whether people in europe are willing to

1396
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,319
move around as much as they were

1397
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,319
before it's a great benefit of the uk

1398
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,160
economy in the past

1399
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,680
you know where that's going to happen is

1400
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,440
again in a rather open question

1401
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,960
i think this is leading us inexorably

1402
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,119
towards some sort of proof of um your

1403
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,640
vaccine status

1404
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,559
uh i think it's very difficult to avoid

1405
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,240
it and it's another one of those liberty

1406
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,880
versus control uh issues that's coming

1407
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,079
up obviously

1408
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,160
um but i can't see how our economy is

1409
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,359
going to recover quickly unless we

1410
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,119
resolve those sorts of issues

1411
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,000
um in favor of entrepreneurs like marco

1412
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,800
and others

1413
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,319
actually to try and help them do their

1414
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,119
business more easily

1415
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,200
carl that that last question is has the

1416
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,720
pandemic brought the western balkans

1417
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,400
closer to europe or further

1418
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,599
what would you say um i suspected that

1419
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,520
we're going to end up in the balkans um

1420
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,559
i mean welcome back

1421
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,119
i hadn't thought about the issue but i

1422
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,559
thought broadly speaking

1423
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,680
yes uh because there will be an

1424
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,200
awareness marker correct me

1425
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,800
there will be an awareness of increasing

1426
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
awareness in the balkans that sort of

1427
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,599
the nation ain't enough i mean there's

1428
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,000
been

1429
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,240
i wouldn't say that balkans is the only

1430
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,280
place where there's been a lot of

1431
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,480
nationalists but there has certainly

1432
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,280
been an abundance of it in the balkans

1433
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,280
and now it's obvious that you you need

1434
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,599
to it is something wider than that

1435
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,960
so i think that the forces of

1436
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,720
integration and cooperation broadly

1437
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,680
speaking

1438
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,720
will probably increase or have

1439
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,040
greater possibilities in the balkans and

1440
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,240
since the balkans

1441
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,000
happens to be in europe um

1442
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,160
so yeah on the balance i think it's

1443
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,200
going to have a good effect

1444
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,280
and then i hope by the way just to link

1445
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,480
up to the previous discussion

1446
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,680
what's going to happen with the economy

1447
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,440
is of course slightly outside the topic

1448
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,480
of our conversation

1449
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,079
is because the digital development will

1450
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,000
take us a giant leap forward

1451
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,960
a giant leap forward that means that

1452
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,359
young

1453
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,200
people will take a giant leap forward

1454
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,040
because young people are more

1455
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,280
the big divide in the world is not

1456
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,640
between

1457
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,960
different geographic geographies is

1458
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,960
between the different generations

1459
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,720
and that means that sort of young people

1460
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,319
in the balkans will probably take it

1461
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:41,280
leap forward and

1462
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,880
cooperate more across the whole

1463
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,400
boundaries that's a

1464
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,800
an optimistic take which i sort of

1465
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,800
basically believe in

1466
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,240
well carl people are going to think that

1467
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,160
we choreographed this

1468
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,119
because the next panel that is coming up

1469
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,079
at 10 to 4

1470
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,200
is on digital democracy so thank you for

1471
00:51:59,200 --> 00:51:59,520
that

1472
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,760
excellent segue let's make that the last

1473
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:02,559
word although i

1474
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,680
am going to to quote marco uh for for my

1475
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,480
summation

1476
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,599
this hunger to improve the box maybe

1477
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,280
great leaders in a crisis think outside

1478
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:12,559
the box but i'm hearing

1479
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,880
just as a major theme of this discussion

1480
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,880
a desire to improve the box

1481
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,960
um especially when it comes to kind of

1482
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,640
international cooperation and

1483
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,240
institutions

1484
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:25,520
so thanks so much to you carl marco and

1485
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,480
suma i really

1486
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,359
appreciate you joining us thanks to you
