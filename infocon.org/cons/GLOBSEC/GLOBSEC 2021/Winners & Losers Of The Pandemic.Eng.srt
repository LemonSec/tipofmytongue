good afternoon everybody good afternoon

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,679
from bratislava from this

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,880
wonderful event that globsec is hosting

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,640
here already since yesterday

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
i think it's a unique event because we

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,000
are not only

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,399
virtually connected but we have over 200

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:41,360
participants

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,000
who are here who are in british lava in

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
different parts of

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,239
of globsec event website forum and i

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,520
think it's uh it shows that

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,079
uh hopefully the pandemic is finishing

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,399
and we are beginning to meet in person

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,320
and uh to be together and be able to

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,640
discuss different issues

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
directly in person so wonderful to

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,479
be in charge and to introduce and share

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,640
this session on winners and losers of

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,280
the

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,400
pandemic we'll have about 45 minutes to

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,799
discuss this important topic i think

30
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,720
there are many discussions already about

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
who are the winners who are the losers

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,520
and what to do about both of them we

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,320
have

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,080

got back from florence a couple nights

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,959
ago and

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,040
if i sort of stop and shout at some

79
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
stage it's because finland will have

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
just scored a goal against russia

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,360
uh we're 20 minutes into the match and

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
we started by scoring in the third

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,599
minutes but this stupid var

84
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,319
system claimed that it was a offside it

85
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,159
wasn't but in any case congratulations

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,840
to slovakia for winning their first

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,720

unfortunately digitalization including

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,680
in soccer has some

91
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
negative consequences but

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840

virtually

107
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
globally from different parts of the

108
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,080
world

109
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,040
i would just like to remind all of us

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,080
all of you that

111
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,640
it is possible to ask questions during

112
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,840
the session

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,640
there are three ways how to do it those

114
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,000
who are in the room

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,880
just please raise your hand and and when

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,079
i give you the floor please

117
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,680
come to the microphone which is right

118
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,479
here there is also a possibility to

119
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,680
ask questions online via globsec

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,560
application called and through slido

121
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,440
system

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,160
and the third one is connecting via zoom

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,759
uh to the virtual studio

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
actually we already have a question from

125
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,440
argentina

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,720
so close to close to mexico or where

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
where angel is now um

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
i would like to actually test this

129
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
system of questions

130
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
only about 10 000 kilometers away

131
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,759
for us from europe it seems like it's

132
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,680
all one big

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
big continent very close to each other

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,520
but yes thank you for reminding

135
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,479
of the distances

136
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,560
so before i ask the each of the

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
panelists to uh

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,560
to give the introductory remarks i would

139
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,520
like to test

140
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
the system itself and there is uh

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,479
one question which would be posed

142
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,400
by slido and we can test the the answers

143
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,120
i think the question could be on the

144
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,600
screen

145
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,919
soon

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,639
yes so the question is will our lives

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,000
after the pandemic be a better or

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,680
worse so those uh who are

149
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,560
on slido please uh check either a or b

150
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,639
it'll be interesting to see what the

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,960
feeling of the audience

152
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
both here but also internationally what

153
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,320
what it is

154
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,240
whether our lives will be influenced in

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,759
a better way

156
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,960
better good 88 better

157
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
that's great very optimistic audience we

158
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,039
have we have today which is

159
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,319
which is wonderful i think it's also

160
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
because finland is going to win so

161
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
everybody is in an optimistic mood uh

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
but uh let let's go now to the panelists

163
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,520
themselves and to the

164
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
introductory remarks um there are

165
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,800
basically

166
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,160
uh two two things which were put

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,319
in front of the panelists and the

168
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,840
session itself

169
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,759
two issues you would like to discuss in

170
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,520
particular but of course

171
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
we can go much broader one

172
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,880
question is who are those winners and

173
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
losers

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,280
of pandemic winners and losers both in

175
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,400
the context of

176
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,639
international environment global

177
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,440
community

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
but also in terms of countries

179
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,280
themselves and within the country

180
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
countries themselves

181
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,319
as well as economic sectors so

182
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,759
kind of defining who are those winners

183
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,599
and losers and the second one

184
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,720
is how can we help the winners and

185
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,479
or rather support the winners and how

186
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,560
can we help losers

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
so maybe those will be the types of

188
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,400
questions in general but uh

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,199
of course up to you uh our friends on

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,319
the panel to

191
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,199
to to uh describe as you as you want so

192
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,880
i would like to start with um

193
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,560
hell mr guria if you could maybe

194
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,800
start with your perspective and if we

195
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,240
could keep the remarks to

196
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,919
five seven minutes uh that would be

197
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,560
appreciated

198
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,479
well i was quite intrigued by

199
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,840
the title because um winners and losers

200
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,039
um

201
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,880
looks like it's a zero-sum game

202
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,319
and um there are uh opportunities or

203
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,240
there are occasions

204
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,280
in the world in history

205
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,479
where you have net losses and i think

206
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,080
this is one of them

207
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,919
this is a truly uh

208
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,759
global problem uh it's much more global

209
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,000
than the global financial crisis

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
of the 2008-2009

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,120
even the most remote island in the world

212
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,039
has not been spared um and um

213
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,280
that also creates a lot of challenges

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
for the future

215
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
uh when you have four million

216
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
deaths uh or close to four million

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,800
deaths

218
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,520
uh you had a large contraction the world

219
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,599
economy three and a half percent

220
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,799
last year we are uh

221
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,519
looking at a six percent growth for the

222
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,679
world economy in 2021

223
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,360
and perhaps four to five percent in

224
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
2022 so we're looking at a recovery

225
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,080
but uh basically the scars

226
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,519
of the pandemic will

227
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,040
be with us uh for much longer uh

228
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,720
even after we bit we beat the pandemic

229
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,560
if that is at all possible

230
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,000
in the next few years the scars of this

231
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,519
impact in terms of

232
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,880
trade in terms of investment in terms of

233
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,200
jobs in terms of poverty

234
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,480
and also in terms of uh

235
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
the future of work there are some things

236
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
which we are still processing and we're

237
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,160
still working on

238
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
um that and we don't know how um

239
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,040
uh how that will evolve but

240
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,320
uh what is important is that

241
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,680
as we build forward

242
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,200
better um that

243
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,240
we make sure that

244
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,839
this reconstruction rebuilding is

245
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
greener that it is more

246
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,959
equal in the sense of uh

247
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,399
not producing as many inequalities as

248
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,000
the pre-pandemic world

249
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,040
had which were widening

250
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,439
and now we have to move towards a

251
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,920
uh towards a less inequalities

252
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,160
not only for moral and ethical reasons

253
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,200
but also

254
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,839
for economic reasons and political

255
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,800
reasons

256
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,760
and of course it has to be more

257
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,560
resilient

258
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,959
in the sense of preparing better

259
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,519
for the neck shock which we know will

260
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,000
come

261
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
we don't know exactly when or in what

262
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,079
form

263
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,760
but i would say that the not not too

264
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,000
many

265
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
winners here uh you do have a few

266
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
companies that made a lot of money in

267
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,200
the process

268
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
um but uh you have to ask even if those

269
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,360
companies

270
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,399
uh given what's going to happen uh to

271
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,720
slow down et etc

272
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,760
are going to continue to be winners in

273
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,440
net terms

274
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,920
i would say this was a net loss for the

275
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,279
world

276
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
and my greatest single concern

277
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,040
now is precisely that we are doing both

278
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,399
the recovery

279
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,839
and the vaccination process uh as well

280
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,040
as the

281
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,800
um as the uh this this green

282
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,320
uh and the equal

283
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
recovery and the resilient recovery in

284
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
very clearly two speeds the developed

285
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,040
world

286
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
is doing much better much faster the

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,800
developing world

288
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
still waiting and

289
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,800
in some cases like vaccination very very

290
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,240
dramatic

291
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,680
differences uh promising that this one

292
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,279
billion vaccines

293
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,480
that just happened a few a few

294
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
days ago at the g7 uh very promising

295
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
um a set of promising uh commitments by

296
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
uh the largest economies in the world uh

297
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,920
but i think today uh when we take stock

298
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,399
of the impact of the pandemic i would

299
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,200
say

300
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,880
mostly losers thank you

301
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,959
thank you very much it's

302
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,160
kind of tough uh assessment of the of

303
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,920
the pandemic itself more on the

304
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
probably negative side uh it will be

305
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,839
interesting to hear from the others

306
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,680
whether there are positive aspects of

307
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,959
the pandemic which

308
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,680
might actually uh lead to some positive

309
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,600
developments uh in in the world

310
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,480
so i would go to to harry harry broadman

311
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,920
uh how do you see the

312
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,120
issue of winners losers uh including and

313
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,320
i know this has been

314
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,839
your focus of your research and

315
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
attention going back to

316
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
to the world bank in terms of uh also

317
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,880
in-country

318
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,000
uh developments and uh differentiation

319
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,959
in terms of uh

320
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,000
sectors but also regional inequalities

321
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,839
uh within the countries um so please

322
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,800
harry

323
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,120
yeah oh thank you very much i i have to

324
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,600
say i i do agree with angel that

325
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
we are all worse off as a result of this

326
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,760
pandemic

327
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,120
um it's and it's not this is not

328
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
like the financial crisis obviously in

329
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,440
the financial crisis

330
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,480
some scars were left in this case there

331
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,279
are

332
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,360
probably different types of scars and

333
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,079
long-lasting in terms of the economies

334
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,120
both of the advanced countries uh and

335
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,399
and the emerging markets um

336
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,399
i would say you know i would make a

337
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,240
couple of points one

338
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
uh the pandemic any disturbance

339
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,199
uh economic disturbance health

340
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,600
disturbance is going to produce

341
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,639
you know in effect uh winners and

342
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,480
and losers um however

343
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
if we think about the pandemic as a as a

344
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,959
as a one-time crisis hopefully

345
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,120
it's important to distinguish between

346
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,760
changes that were already underway

347
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,720
in other words structural changes and

348
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,639
the cyclical changes if you will

349
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,360
that were engendered by the pandemic and

350
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,160
so

351
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,959
when we think about uh industries and

352
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,680
countries

353
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,760
you know how how have they been affected

354
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,360
as we as we hopefully come out of this

355
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,639
one of the obvious changes is the way

356
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,360
that people

357
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,240
work and the way that the services

358
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,320
industries are going to be

359
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,800
structured going forward and when you

360
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
think about

361
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,959
shopping as we all know going to a store

362
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,639
now to buy certain things not all things

363
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,000
you might well just do this by your desk

364
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,720
and wait for a company to deliver the

365
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
goods so there's

366
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,000
differences ways and work the question

367
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,160
though is you know how will certain

368
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,079
people of different incomes be able to

369
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,639
do that

370
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,680
how much access do they have to the

371
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,320
services

372
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
infrastructure will they be the ones

373
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
that need to go to the stores for

374
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,560
instance or go to the factories

375
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,079
um i think the other question is

376
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,800
when you think about uh structural

377
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,199
changes that were already underway

378
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,440
uh think about artificial intelligence

379
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,199
and digitalization

380
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,279
and so when we think about the logistics

381
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,600
industry or the shipping industry

382
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,759
there were already changes in in the

383
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,800
works except for

384
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,279
delivery of certain goods at the last

385
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,399
mile

386
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,759
where shipping and logistics was already

387
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,279
becoming digitalized

388
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,320
and more animated if you will and that

389
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,759
is a trend that is going to be

390
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,199
accelerated as a result of the pandemic

391
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,320
when we think in terms of the countries

392
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,959
you know the advanced countries

393
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,320
particularly because they

394
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
have more resilient health systems and

395
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,519
more resilient

396
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,600
economies you know they're they're

397
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,199
certainly coming out of this

398
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,600
at least according to the latest uh

399
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,800
forecasts

400
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,839
you know they're beginning to rebound

401
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
obviously whether that rebound will be

402
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,320
permanent

403
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,600
and and you know

404
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,639
lasting in terms of robust growth for

405
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,720
several years to come i think i think is

406
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,240
is an open question

407
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,160
and that brings me to the other part of

408
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,839
the world the emerging markets and the

409
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,279
poor countries

410
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
which i think are decidedly much worse

411
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,399
off both for the mortality issues that

412
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,320
angel raises that we're already

413
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,600
concerned about and

414
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,639
knowledgeable of but you know how will

415
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,440
they

416
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,920
begin to restructure their workplaces

417
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,440
how will they begin

418
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
to restructure how they trade with not

419
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,639
just

420
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,880
each other but with other countries of

421
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,959
the world and i think

422
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,360
net net i think populations in the

423
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
emerging markets

424
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,079
uh will be much worse off as a result of

425
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,920
of the pandemic um i do think that this

426
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,959
is we need to emphasize that this is a

427
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,079
work in progress

428
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,400
that yes we we appear to be coming out

429
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,919
of the pandemic

430
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,199
but i think it's really quite premature

431
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,240
for those of us uh who are on the front

432
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,919
lines at least thinking about this from

433
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:18,959
an economic

434
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
perspective uh to believe that that it's

435
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,640
over

436
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,559
it may be over for the wealthy countries

437
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,679
but it's certainly not

438
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
over for the vast population of the

439
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
of the planet and to the extent that

440
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,480
um those other countries are not

441
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,120
vaccinated there is not sufficient herd

442
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,880
immunity within the countries the

443
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,320
emerging markets

444
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,080
that means that all of us around the

445
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,360
world are not

446
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,960
going to enjoy any kind of herd immunity

447
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
if we believe that the globalized

448
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,120
economy is here to stay which i think it

449
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:51,840
is

450
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,240
but it does raise the question about

451
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,400
whether or not there will be

452
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,360
a splitting if you will a decoupling

453
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,720
from the advanced countries and the

454
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,120
emerging markets in terms of

455
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,160
economic growth for the last two decades

456
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,280
the gdp growth rate of gdp growth

457
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,919
real terms in in emerging markets

458
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,200
really was about twice the rate of gdp

459
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
growth in real terms of the advanced

460
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,720
economies regardless of the business

461
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,160
cycle

462
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
that is shown in the data very clearly i

463
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,720
think now the question before us is

464
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,440
whether

465
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,679
there's going to be a structural shift

466
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,200
in that whether or not growth in

467
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,360
emerging markets put aside china i'm

468
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,320
talking about

469
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,400
the other emerging markets and put aside

470
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,440
india

471
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,000
whether or not their growth will be uh

472
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,240
downgraded significantly and whether

473
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,880
there will be a structural split

474
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,320
between the poor and the wealthy

475
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
countries so those i think

476
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,679
when i think about the winners and the

477
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,080
losers so to speak of the pandemic

478
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,600
that's that's the way i think about

479
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,799
things and i think it's it's really a

480
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,960
decidedly

481
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,760
mixed picture and we are not out of the

482
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,640
woods yet by

483
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,480
by a long stretch in mice in my view

484
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,799
thank you very much harry i think you

485
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,000
are certainly right that uh

486
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,480
it is a mixed mixed picture in terms of

487
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,200
the recovery

488
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,160
the recovery is very uneven um i think

489
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:16,799
when

490
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,679
i go to the streets of bratislava i was

491
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
and i live in prague i was last week in

492
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,640
budapest

493
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
i can see many people outside there is a

494
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,720
kind of

495
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,440
good spirit uh that we are getting to

496
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,360
this recovery phase and

497
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,000
people can enjoy more the freedom and

498
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,360
being outside

499
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,160
so i feel a lot of optimism plus some

500
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
numbers which are coming out of

501
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,080
of of the economic situation in the

502
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,440
countries of at least of the european

503
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,799
union show to the

504
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,760
positive evolution and very strong

505
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,799
recovery

506
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,520
but at the same time as you mentioned in

507
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
the developing emerging markets

508
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
the picture is quite different so this

509
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,280
issue of decoupling as you

510
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,520
mentioned here is a is a real one and uh

511
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,480
question is how to

512
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,039
how to address it but let's go to to

513
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:03,679
alex

514
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,679
how do you see this issue of winners and

515
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,840
losers and what's uh what's your

516
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,200
point of view yeah

517
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
sure thanks and and you know thanks to

518
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,280
angel and harry for their

519
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,480
uh outlines um i agree with a lot of it

520
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,000
but i'll probably put a slightly more

521
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
positive spin to the whole package and

522
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,320
let me phrase it like this

523
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,480
i think probably the more relevant

524
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,360
question

525
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,559
than winners and losers is what did we

526
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,280
learn

527
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,799
and i think this is then going to

528
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,720
determine whether you're a winner or a

529
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
loser in this overall situation and and

530
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,960
you know in academia you never get black

531
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,159
and white dancers

532
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,799
you just the every answer to every

533
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,280
question is well it depends

534
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,360
so it depends i mean first observation

535
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
much like was said earlier this is a

536
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,480
global crisis

537
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,440
uh and in many ways it's a crisis that

538
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,080
uh

539
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,120
from a health perspective uh hit us

540
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,520
symmetrically in other words we're all

541
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,960
uh equally touched

542
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,440
by the virus in one way or another

543
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,760
there's no defense mechanism as

544
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,240
as such but then in terms of the actual

545
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
impact and how it hit

546
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,440
us globally regionally and otherwise

547
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,880
it is of course very asymmetrical

548
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,520
i think this crisis is transnational

549
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,000
across

550
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,240
border and i think what basically

551
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,039
we need to try to assess and understand

552
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:27,440
uh

553
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,159
is is three elements of it the political

554
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,720
the economic and the health perspective

555
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,280
and if i wind those i think a lot of

556
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,760
political leaders at the moment

557
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,840
they understand that they will be judged

558
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,559
on the basis of three criteria

559
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,039
in how they have managed this pandemic

560
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,039
number one is very morbid

561
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,000
it's the number of dead it can either be

562
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,559
you know

563
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,559
counted by per capita or accrued

564
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,039
casualties so in the united states uh

565
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,280
just today or yesterday i think

566
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,960
it surpassed the figure of 600 000

567
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,159
casualties to to the pandemic

568
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,480
the number two criteria is the rollout

569
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,840
of the vaccines

570
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,520
and i fully understand that i'm looking

571
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,679
at this now from a western developing

572
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,200
country perspective

573
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,280
uh and perhaps a little bit sort of

574
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,799
internally

575
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,799
of you know how the rollout has happened

576
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,880
in europe how it's happened in the uk

577
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,840
and the us

578
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,000
and how then the developing world is

579
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,440
able to

580
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,480
export the vaccines as harry mentioned

581
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,280
earlier

582
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,480
in the aftermath of the g7

583
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,960
meeting the third criteria is going to

584
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,200
be economic in other words how quickly

585
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
do you recover

586
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,320
uh from uh the impact of the pandemic

587
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,960
because

588
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,760
of course the economic impact was

589
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,520
radically different from the one that

590
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,480
you know vasil and i and many others saw

591
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,559
during the financial crisis and the euro

592
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,440
crisis

593
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,360
because this was both a supply and a

594
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,799
demand sign

595
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,679
crisis and here we then come to to to

596
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,039
basically lessons

597
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,159
learned now the reason i fall onto the

598
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,480
you know if this was a really binary

599
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,880
question did we win or lose on this

600
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
the reason i say that we will most

601
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
probably win is the following number one

602
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,840
the the biggest winner in this is is

603
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,720
science

604
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,360
i think was it not for uh crispr

605
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,960
technology

606
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,440
as put forward and then rewarded

607
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,159
by jennifer doudna and emmanuel

608
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,320
charpentiere with the nobel prize of

609
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,080
crispr technology we would have not

610
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,600
gotten this vaccine

611
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,559
so fast so you know i i mean i'm really

612
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,559
really impressed what science was able

613
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,960
to do and also what big pharma was able

614
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,000
to produce

615
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,520
uh in terms of vaccines

616
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
the second winner in this i think is

617
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
actually global corporation

618
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
to a certain extent a lot of political

619
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
leaders who had some nationalistic

620
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
tendencies i'm not saying that they

621
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,960
haven't gone away

622
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,679
uh realized that on this one we need to

623
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,400
cooperate

624
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,720
even uh you know of course we were quite

625
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,480
lucky in the sense that in the united

626
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,240
states they'll switch from donald trump

627
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,799
to to

628
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,600
joe biden so that sort of accelerated

629
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,799
the idea of of corporation the w.h.o

630
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,840
uh etc etc and actually today the

631
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,919
commission has come out with uh

632
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,880
10 points or 10 lessons learned from the

633
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,120
pandemic which we can discuss but

634
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
they're sort of quite global lessons uh

635
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,559
if you will

636
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,960
um a third one is a bit of a soft one i

637
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
i think this has been a collective human

638
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,159
experience

639
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,640
you know we as human beings understand

640
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,279
each other

641
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,000
from all around the world differently uh

642
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,120
as a result of

643
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,760
of this pandemic because we understood

644
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
understand what

645
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,840
what a pandemic means how it can hit all

646
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,640
of us

647
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,279
uh in no matter where we are and in that

648
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,279
sense there's a collective experience

649
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,960
which goes beyond the

650
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,279
sort of more traditional identity or

651
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,400
national

652
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,720
collective experience and i think that's

653
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,480
uh an important one

654
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,279
the two other winners of of of this uh

655
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,279
crisis albeit short term

656
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:10,320
uh one is climate um and

657
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,919
the reason i say this is i just read

658
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,120
bill gates

659
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
latest book on the climate crisis where

660
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,480
he says that

661
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,159
in order for us to solve the climate

662
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,039
crisis we need to reduce

663
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,480
the greenhouse emissions

664
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,360
per annum right now there are 51 billion

665
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,240
tons

666
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
actually we need to reduce them to zero

667
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,760
so there's a long work ahead

668
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,159
uh but the estimate that we have seen is

669
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,720
that the the kovidia brought it already

670
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,039
down to 47 billion tons

671
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,200
so i think this was a good awareness

672
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,880
type and then finally i

673
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,000
you know for us information managers who

674
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,880
sit in different

675
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,640
capitals around the world in front of

676
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,960
screens and put numbers and

677
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,960
letters together and express them either

678
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,039
on video or in writing or in speech or

679
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,480
however it might be i mean you know the

680
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,320
future work is different

681
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,400
i know vasil you like to travel a lot

682
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,440
right uh

683
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,159
but you know to be honest uh you'll have

684
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,000
less of an argument to

685
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,159
take every trip in the future a lot of

686
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,000
our future work is going to be behind

687
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,880
the screen

688
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
especially in the line of work that we

689
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,000
do for better

690
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
or for worse having said that i do miss

691
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,400
the social contact as well

692
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,559
so this is my take on the pandemic

693
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,200
perhaps attach more optimistic than that

694
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,400
of harry and angel thank you

695
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,039
thank you alex yes i do like to travel

696
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:31,600
because i

697
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,240
i like meeting people on the other hand

698
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,600
i have to say that

699
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,640
during the pandemic and lockdown my wife

700
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,600
was very happy

701
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,440
because we were after a long time

702
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,039
together as a family and it was

703
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,799
quite a actually quite very nice

704
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,159
experience so

705
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,200
uh and all it's all relevant anyway uh

706
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,600
i would like to combine some questions

707
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,159
my wife was very happy at the beginning

708
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,320
and now she says well what you find

709
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,760
something to do you know

710
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,520
so so it's it's a it's a question of

711
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,240
relative

712
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,000
relatives yeah my wife has

713
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,670
a loud spouse problem

714
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,159
[Laughter]

715
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,600
does it mean in finland

716
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,240
well it means that when i have these

717
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
earphones airpods in

718
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
and she's having her zoom in the other

719
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,700
meeting she comes to the door and says

720
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,600
[Laughter]

721
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,640
i i can i can understand that uh

722
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,600
but uh i can maybe uh a question

723
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,440
question to you and uh i would like to

724
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,039
i would like to combine some questions

725
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,279
which are coming through slido

726
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,080
and one is actually coming from mexico

727
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,039
uh

728
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:43,919
uh from from your home country and hell

729
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,960
and uh

730
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,080
it says uh it's coming from mauricio

731
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,200
meshulam and says special health from

732
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,279
mexico to mr guria you can actually see

733
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:53,919
it

734
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,240
on the screen in countries as ours and

735
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,520
most of the world's poverty and

736
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,840
inequality are increasingly

737
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,559
increasing severely why you feel will be

738
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,360
better

739
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,600
i think it's more reaction to the poll

740
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
which we did at the very beginning which

741
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,840
showed that

742
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,919
most of the people are optimistic at

743
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,520
least those who are connected to this

744
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,399
session

745
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,279
over 80 percent but i think i hear what

746
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,880
you described was actually much more

747
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,399
sobering evaluation of the

748
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,840
impact of pandemic but if you want to

749
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,919
uh respond to mauricio from mexico yes i

750
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,480
think

751
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,159
what what what he needed was the third a

752
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:30,720
c

753
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,320
item because it was binary it was better

754
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,840
or it was worse and the the

755
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,880
the c one depended a lot on what harry

756
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,080
mentioned which is what do we do

757
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,279
about these challenges today are we

758
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,399
going to build

759
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,080
greener well we're not doing a great job

760
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,200
uh we have spent about 16

761
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,039
trillion which is about 75

762
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,159
of the us economy just to put in context

763
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,000
um by the way oda

764
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,760
overseas development assistance is only

765
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,240
160

766
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,880
billion that's one percent of what has

767
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
been spent

768
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
in you know throwing at the the the

769
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,520
virus

770
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,000
and it just gives you an idea of how

771
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,799
much more

772
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,159
room there is uh for

773
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,360
developed countries for richer countries

774
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,960
to spend more on what would be

775
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,080
not only generous but very smart

776
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,360
spending going forward to help the least

777
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,640
developed countries but the

778
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,039
now what are we doing in terms of green

779
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,760
even

780
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,720
in these trillions that we've spent it's

781
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,360
only

782
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,080
uh a very small fraction that is

783
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
deliberately green

784
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,720
most of the money is being invested and

785
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,200
thrown

786
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,360
at uh well jobs and companies and

787
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,760
whatever all the support systems but

788
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,799
basically

789
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,799
uh what i would call the traditional

790
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,919
type of

791
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,520
uh investment the status quo uh very

792
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,000
little

793
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,039
is being deliberately green and a very

794
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:13,520
large

795
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,720
part also is being harmful

796
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
deliberately you know it's it's it's

797
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,080
harmful to the

798
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,720
to the environment so basically we are

799
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
undoing with one hand

800
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,039
what we're very strenuously doing with

801
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:27,919
the other hand

802
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,799
so we're not doing great on the green on

803
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,399
the equality

804
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,559
well the problem is that uh the

805
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,919
crisis itself you know we had a bad

806
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,320
situation before the pandemic

807
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,159
okay we had a bad situation in terms of

808
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,760
uh trade it was flat with all these

809
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,679
these tensions between the united states

810
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,360
and china and everything else and

811
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,159
in the united states and and europe and

812
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,360
and

813
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,240
south korea and and what have you in

814
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
japan etc

815
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,880
so we had a problem before

816
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,770
we had a problem with investment because

817
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,320
[Music]

818
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,559
well insecurity uncertainty

819
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,760
breeds low growth

820
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,120
why through the investment uh channel

821
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,399
and investment had flattened

822
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,440
uh the same thing uh you know you

823
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,480
you you did not have um

824
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,159
productivity growth was was very low

825
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,200
uh if at all um

826
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,440
business dynamism the so-called churn in

827
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,799
terms of jobs

828
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,799
and in terms of creation of new

829
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,399
companies vis-a-vis the ones that

830
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,840
disappeared

831
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
and then the question i repeat of

832
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,039
unequal opportunities the question of

833
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,159
uh inclusiveness so that was bad

834
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,600
before the pandemic and then the

835
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,360
pandemic struck

836
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,919
and the pandemic has been terrible in

837
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:00,640
terms of

838
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,679
inequality so again

839
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,640
i refer to to harry's point about what

840
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,519
do we do

841
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,480
about the opportunity now what do we do

842
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,240
about the policies now

843
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,840
so we don't really know how we are going

844
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,080
to

845
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,200
end up it depends a lot on the policies

846
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
that we take

847
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,519
and also because a very very large part

848
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,799
of the world

849
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,799
the larger part of the world which is

850
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,720
the developing world

851
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,960
we still have not taken a very clear

852
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,320
position

853
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,399
the only thing that has started now is

854
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,080
the question of vaccination

855
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,000
but as tedros at the who said

856
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,480
we don't need 1 billion we need 11

857
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,080
billion vaccines

858
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,799
now but a billion is a starter it's a

859
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,000
good way to start

860
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,039
and then maybe with availability and

861
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:51,440
with

862
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,480
uh greater financial support we will get

863
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,440
better

864
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
and then the question of resiliency i we

865
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,880
were caught

866
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,919
with our parents down absolutely uh in

867
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:02,399
terms

868
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,840
of our health systems and that includes

869
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,880
the uh more developed countries in the

870
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,399
world uh

871
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,720
so now clearly the the question is

872
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,120
we have already rebuilt in this last

873
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,840
year

874
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,720
but the question is what to do going

875
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,519
forward

876
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,640
and then again the developing world the

877
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,200
developing world the emerging economies

878
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,240
what are we going to do about them uh

879
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,080
so i think the the question is

880
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,960
rather than being optimistic or

881
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,000
pessimistic

882
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,120
the question is how to be activistic

883
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,080
how to get on with it how to start to

884
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,720
work

885
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,159
uh towards uh what we can build about

886
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,640
uh you know do a better future the

887
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,000
digitalization question

888
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,799
which was uh uh evoked for example is

889
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,399
absolutely crucial

890
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,399
uh what are we gonna do about it because

891
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,159
digitalization can actually

892
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,360
produce a lot of lost jobs

893
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,200
uh in the lower part of the workforce

894
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,839
the lower skilled part of the workforce

895
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,879
the question is

896
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,879
how are we going to upskill how are we

897
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,480
going to uh

898
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,679
you know reskill

899
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,199
uh the working force so uh what i see

900
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,280
uh is is a la vasil is is a lot of

901
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,679
a lot of challenges and a lot of

902
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,280
question marks

903
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,560
but also i would say very clear paths

904
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,000
to action and to policy

905
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,918
and therefore i would say let's get on

906
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,280
with it

907
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,359
uh rather than say winners or losers or

908
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,000
optimistic or pessimistic says well we

909
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
got what we got uh we got the situation

910
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,159
now

911
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,040
uh huge amounts of money unprecedented

912
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,440
amount

913
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,879
of money but been allocated and

914
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,639
dedicated to

915
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,599
fighting the pandemic the question now

916
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,720
is we got to get

917
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,160
a lot more targeted build resilience

918
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,040
build sustainability

919
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,200
[Music]

920
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,720
and upskill

921
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,119
build a more inclusive more sustainable

922
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,960
recovery

923
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,119
because we're not doing uh a very great

924
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,520
job so far

925
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,079
thank you i fully agree with you and i

926
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,440
think it goes back to the

927
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,839
uh to the point that alex made which is

928
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:26,480
uh

929
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,240
uh what have you learned from this

930
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,079
pandemic from the crisis and how

931
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,560
are we going to rebuild in a better way

932
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,480
and i think about this new policies and

933
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,839
ways how we tackle

934
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,000
uh some of the issues uh i mean they

935
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,960
have been with us

936
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,680
the inequalities etc uh but they have

937
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,320
been aggravated by by the pandemic

938
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,400
but i would like to move to to to harry

939
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,680
and uh

940
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,000
kind of two types of questions one is

941
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
about the supply chain

942
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,440
and uh the impact on global trade etc we

943
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,480
have seen obviously

944
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,680
during the especially in the beginning

945
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,760
of pandemic many disruptions

946
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,920
to the supply chains many countries kind

947
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,800
of focusing

948
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,920
internally on their own problems um

949
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,320
big issues for the global trade decrease

950
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,119
in

951
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,800
in the international cross-border

952
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
investments etc

953
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,720
a lot of discussion for example in the

954
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,480
european union union about so-called

955
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,760
strategic autonomy

956
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,960
as a response to this fragility

957
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,400
what do you think is the status or the

958
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,560
situation now and how can we deal with

959
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,480
these issues for the future

960
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,079
and the second issue is as

961
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,599
macroeconomist what do you think about

962
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,079
the

963
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,720
growing inflation and uh to what degree

964
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,520
is this a

965
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,119
big issue or is it something which is a

966
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,040
kind of just temporary phenomenon

967
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,119
you know it's very interesting about

968
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:44,560
about the supply chain

969
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,599
uh because i i not only was a private

970
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,440
equity investor in companies that

971
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,400
engage in the shipping and logistics and

972
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,640
supply chain management but now i'm i'm

973
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,839
an advisor to them

974
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,720
and deal with investment disputes around

975
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,359
them

976
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,760
was that many people in industry even

977
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,200
very senior people

978
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,800
in industry when china went offline

979
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,440
because of the pandemic and sort of the

980
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,160
world

981
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,200
shut down for for a moment and and

982
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,440
that's being optimistic

983
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,800
all of a sudden executives were finding

984
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,320
out that you know it's not just a

985
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,680
question of

986
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,920
the supply chain running you know

987
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,040
bilaterally

988
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,599
if you will between china let's say in

989
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,119
the united states

990
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:31,359
rather what happened over the last two

991
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,800
or three decades

992
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,400
is supply chains have become

993
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,079
extraordinarily complex

994
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,440
and tiered so that a product that

995
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,359
you know might have a label made in

996
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,160
china on it that comes to us shores

997
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,400
you know some component maybe a basic

998
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
component is manufactured in china

999
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,200
that then is shipped over to let's say

1000
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,160
thailand

1001
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,240
where an additional component is put on

1002
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,760
it more value added

1003
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,000
and then it gets shipped maybe to brazil

1004
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,680
where there's more of a finishing

1005
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,839
of of the product and then it comes to

1006
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:03,200
the united states

1007
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,400
and so when china went offline all of a

1008
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,720
sudden many firms recognize that

1009
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,480
it's not just because china went offline

1010
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,079
but because they were the

1011
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,440
maybe the producer of the first link

1012
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,599
in that chain and they realized oh my

1013
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,359
god the supply chains are

1014
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,359
extraordinarily complex

1015
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,119
people in middle management and people

1016
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,280
who are you know working the ropes

1017
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,839
they understood this so i think that has

1018
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:28,640
really been

1019
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,400
an eye opener for much of industry today

1020
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,119
and i think when you combine this this

1021
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,560
issue which i raised and i'm sure

1022
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,200
also echoed with the digitalization i

1023
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,680
think

1024
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,000
it really means that supply chains in

1025
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,160
order to become more resilient from

1026
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,200
shocks

1027
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,720
whether it's a health shock whether it's

1028
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,400
a pure economic shock whether it's a

1029
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,000
natural disaster

1030
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,560
i think people are beginning to rethink

1031
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,560
how can we make these supply chains more

1032
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,160
resilient and one of the things that's

1033
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,000
beginning to happen

1034
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,440
is adding redundancy uh

1035
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,000
into supply chain it's almost like when

1036
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,040
a power plant

1037
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,240
goes offline you have spare capacity

1038
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,560
to take care of peak problems i think

1039
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,800
what we are beginning to see now

1040
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,160
in industry is investment in uh

1041
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,839
second tier uh other types of ways of

1042
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,320
supplying into the supply chain from

1043
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,079
places that you might not have

1044
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,960
ordinarily have thought of as being part

1045
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,880
of the supply chain

1046
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,880
i think with respect to inflation

1047
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,720
you know there's a raging debate here as

1048
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,960
many people may know

1049
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,800
about whether or not inflation at least

1050
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,079
in the united states

1051
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,240
where i'm sitting is going to be a

1052
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,760
significant problem

1053
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,079
now i think a lot of people have been

1054
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,280
surprised at

1055
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,839
how much pent-up demand there was for

1056
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,760
products for services

1057
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,599
and as a result of some policy mixes

1058
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,960
people are at record levels applying

1059
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,079
for new jobs and leaving other jobs

1060
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,720
but i think what also has been under

1061
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,160
misunderstood

1062
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,240
is that although there is a rise in

1063
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,760
prices now

1064
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,280
this is a natural part of macroeconomic

1065
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,400
resiliency of you get you get a blip

1066
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,599
in demand but then it settles down to

1067
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,359
its more stable state

1068
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,880
and so for instance there was a really

1069
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,560
interesting article in the wall street

1070
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,200
journal

1071
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,599
yesterday or the day before about where

1072
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,880
lumber prices

1073
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,520
have gone through the roof from you know

1074
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
home depot and other package stores for

1075
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,560
building supplies

1076
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,000
oh and people began to buy excess amount

1077
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,920
of lumber thinking that they could then

1078
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,920
resell it by making a profit all of a

1079
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,800
sudden

1080
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
they're realizing that there's excess

1081
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,400
supply of lumber out there and

1082
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,000
lumber prices now are beginning to

1083
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,079
decline so i think there's

1084
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,720
there is very much an open question

1085
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,680
about whether

1086
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,640
these tendencies will result in in a

1087
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
stable state of inflation

1088
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,640
inflation does not necessarily just mean

1089
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,000
a rise in prices it means a sustained

1090
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,200
rise in prices and that it permeates the

1091
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:07,839
economy

1092
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,839
not just in wages but in the prices of

1093
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,240
goods and the price of utility services

1094
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,520
and the like

1095
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,640
i i don't know uh whether we have a

1096
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,680
serious inflation bound uh but i do have

1097
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,000
a

1098
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,079
fair amount of confidence at this point

1099
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,200
with respect to

1100
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,440
the federal reserve policy where you

1101
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,520
know interest rates are extraordinarily

1102
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,520
low so there's there's ammunition that

1103
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,400
they could use

1104
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,640
the question is will they overshoot and

1105
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,319
that's what the debate is about whether

1106
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:34,960
or not

1107
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,480
they might raise interest rates too

1108
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,800
quickly and then force us into

1109
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,359
a deep recession but i think this is

1110
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,000
still

1111
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,599
very much a painting in progress and i

1112
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,599
would tell people who are

1113
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,440
extraordinarily worried about

1114
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,680
inflation to take a deep breath and

1115
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,800
let's just see

1116
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,640
how things pan out over the next month

1117
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,319
or so to figure out whether or not this

1118
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,079
is a sustained

1119
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,680
change in demand leading to real

1120
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,520
rises and prices thank you harry

1121
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,359
thank you and uh because we don't have

1122
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,720
much time we have uh

1123
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,200
uh three minutes left uh so before i go

1124
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,000
to alex

1125
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
uh i want to use the question which came

1126
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
via slido

1127
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,200
basically i think we can show the

1128
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,760
question itself

1129
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,520
should companies with fragile balance

1130
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,880
sheets even

1131
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,359
pre-endemic right to the recovery wave

1132
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:29,200
benefit from the government help

1133
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,240
i i think i would formulate it in a way

1134
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,119
what is the role of governments in this

1135
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,880
recovery phase

1136
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,079
and we have seen many types of responses

1137
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,079
during the pandemic especially in the

1138
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,000
form of providing a lot of liquidity

1139
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,520
to the markets monetary easing different

1140
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,440
guarantee schemes which were developed

1141
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,680
for small medium enterprises to be able

1142
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,359
to survive

1143
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,200
now as we are getting out of this

1144
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
situation of course with high

1145
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,880
public debt deficits etc to what degree

1146
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,440
should governments play a proactive role

1147
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:03,920
maybe

1148
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,200
in the process itself uh we know that

1149
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,319
we have the recovery and resilience plan

1150
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,359
750 billion coming in the in the eu

1151
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:15,839
and many other uh instruments which are

1152
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,760
which are coming so is is this uh

1153
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,079
the right way should it be more maybe

1154
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,359
kind of less affair

1155
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,480
um alex uh how do you see the role of

1156
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,000
governments in this

1157
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,680
post-pandemic or recovery phase

1158
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,760
no in one minute keynes or adam smith

1159
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,680
brief answer i think in the first year

1160
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,160
the european union and the united states

1161
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,119
if i may use

1162
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,680
developing economies developed economies

1163
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
used every club in the bag

1164
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,760
to get out of this the european union

1165
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,119
did in four months

1166
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,960
what it was not able to do in four years

1167
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,040
during the euro crisis number one

1168
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,920
the ecb's pep program number two the eib

1169
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,760
is program from small and medium-sized

1170
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,880
businesses

1171
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,200
uh number three converting the european

1172
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,880
stability mechanism into a health

1173
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,720
mechanism number four the commission's

1174
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,079
sure and trust plans

1175
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,319
and number five the recovery and

1176
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:12,400
resilience facility in other words next

1177
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,680
generation europe

1178
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,319
that was huge on top of what the member

1179
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,680
states themselves did

1180
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,520
i can just give you an example from the

1181
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,119
country that i know best

1182
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,400
20 billion euros in excess

1183
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,640
lending during the first year of the

1184
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,640
pandemic and remember this is a country

1185
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,040
with an

1186
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,920
annual budget of roughly 55 billion and

1187
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,000
with a gdp of roughly a little bit over

1188
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,280
200 billion

1189
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,079
so i would probably at this stage tone

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,680
virtually

1217
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,319
and uh i think we have certainly a mixed

1218
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,280
picture but i

1219
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,359
believe that we have learned at least

1220
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,720
something from uh

1221
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,480
from pandemic and will be able to

1222
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,400
rebuild the world in a better way

1223
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,680
especially in dealing with the

1224
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,680
inequalities both

1225
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,520
among the countries within the countries

1226
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,960
and among the different sectors of

1227
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,680
economy

1228
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,000
