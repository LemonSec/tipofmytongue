that the forum is grateful

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
for this opportunity to hear your

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,239
insights today on how we can bridge the

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,039
gap

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
on the you know the digital marketplace

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
through a renewed or refreshed eu

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,960
us data agenda now the covid19 pandemic

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,480
has accelerated the use of the

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
technologies now we've used it to

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
control the virus

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,840
and it's spread and also on research and

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
we've developed those effective

33
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,600
vaccines but also to ensure that people

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,520
could stay connected

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,159
and safe online as well at home so

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,520
clearly digital

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,600
was here to help and to avoid further

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,720
disruptions

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,960
and just as clear as how technology is

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,479
what will help us

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,720
dealing with the consequences of of the

42
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
pandemic you know to reboot our economy

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,840
and restart

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,159
uh you know with the recovery if we

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,840
allow of course the technology to

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,360
flourish so we really have

47
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
this great opportunity to better manage

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,119
and foster the efficient use

49
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,759
and sound deployment of technology so in

50
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,799
this context

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,720
there's great momentum especially this

52
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,560
week when it comes to digital policy in

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
the relations between the us and the eu

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
and i'd like to start by asking you why

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,960
do you think this transatlantic

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
partnership and this dialogue are so

57
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
important

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,920
in this what should be its role in

59
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
restarting the the economy especially in

60
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
the digital

61
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,680
era and and also what are the conditions

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
that the us and eu

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
should enable together in the data

64
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,399
economy for

65
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,560
for us you know to to be able to use

66
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
technologies better and quicker perhaps

67
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
even to predict future crisis

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
well first of all i think you've framed

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
the issue really well and just when we

70
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,239
think about where we are in the world

71
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,120
today

72
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,760
as you put it you know the world runs on

73
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,840
digital technology the world runs on

74
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,319
data

75
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,599
and that's true for each of the

76
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,440
communities and countries in which we

77
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,879
live

78
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,000
and it's going to become each even more

79
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,480
vital

80
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,720
each and every year i think the first

81
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
thing we have to do is just

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
ensure that the issues around digital

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,319
technology and data

84
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,080
are indeed playing a central visible

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,280
explicit role in the eu

86
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
us agenda we won't deal with these

87
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,560
issues well if we don't give them the

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
attention that they deserve

89
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,760
second i think we need to recognize that

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,239
the flow of data across the atlantic

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,800
is perhaps even more important than the

92
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,040
flow of people and the flow of people is

93
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
something we've been suffering from a

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,760
lack of and

95
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,159
we need to get people and data

96
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
continuing to move on an ongoing basis

97
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,000
to do that we need to recognize i think

98
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,280
a third thing

99
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
and that's the critical need to put in

100
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,720
place

101
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,159
common or at least consistent rules

102
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
that really respect the values on each

103
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
side of the atlantic

104
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
certainly in europe data needs to be

105
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,599
protected in a manner that is consistent

106
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
with european values that conforms with

107
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
european law

108
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,760
of course i like to remind my friends in

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,000
the united states where i live that

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,959
our american values frankly are rooted

111
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,720
in european values they

112
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,159
come from europe and i think we need to

113
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
then start to work through the specific

114
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,599
challenges

115
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,920
and take them one by one recognizing

116
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,680
that some of them are hard

117
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,599
but we need to make progress across the

118
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,840
board

119
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,000
thank you very much and let's hope the

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,920
message will come clear

121
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,040
uh to uh to the u.s and the eu as their

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
meeting in brussels

123
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,680
now with this new biden administration

124
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
transatlantic partnership and relations

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,358
seem to be back on track and

126
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,680
both partners seem to be rooting for you

127
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
know fresher and stronger dialogue

128
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,840
on tech and trade but let's be honest

129
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,600
there are some unresolved

130
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,880
critical issues let's let's let's

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,720
use that term when it comes to data

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
governance so what do you think should

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,680
be maybe the

134
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,199
well if you have one or two main

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,600
priorities that both partners

136
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
uh must really address to preserve and

137
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
strengthen their relations and their

138
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,520
impact and maybe some of the concrete

139
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,840
ways in which they should do so maybe

140
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
you know what kind of data governance or

141
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,759
agreements could help us

142
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,320
through it well i i do think that things

143
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,479
are moving in a common and positive

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,320
direction and you see governments on

145
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
both sides of the atlantic

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
that want to work together that want to

147
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
make things work and i think that's

148
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,479
welcome news

149
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,639
for everyone because we all depend on

150
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,240
this flow of data

151
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,880
i think the clear starting point frankly

152
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,080
needs to be

153
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
to come to terms with the issues that

154
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
are front and center in the wake of the

155
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,440
shrems ii decision we are

156
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,080
dealing with something that is just sort

157
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
of one step

158
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,520
short of a genuine crisis in the ability

159
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
to move data across the atlantic the

160
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
ability of european companies

161
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,440
to do business in the united states the

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,840
ability of my company to do business in

163
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,639
europe and support european customers

164
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,759
so i think the sooner we can get

165
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,960
something in place that both sides of

166
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
the atlantic feel good about

167
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
the better but i also think that we not

168
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,919
only need to move

169
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,759
fast we need to act with a level of

170
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,039
ambition

171
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,919
the issues that we're seeing around data

172
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,520
and privacy

173
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
are obviously sort of going around and

174
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,080
around again we've been at this now for

175
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,160
multiple years

176
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,319
as the safe harbor was replaced by the

177
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,199
privacy shield and now we're at it again

178
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,840
and i think what it really requires is

179
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
that we put in place a

180
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,319
longer term deeper and more stable

181
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
agreement between governments

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,199
i think this can build on the statutory

183
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,840
foundation in the cloud act that was

184
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,039
passed by the u.s congress in 2017 that

185
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,039
creates the legal authority for the

186
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,400
executive branch

187
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,680
to enter into an agreement with say

188
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,000
european governments to negotiate with

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
the european commission uh and i think

190
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
we need to look even

191
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,919
more broadly than that i think that that

192
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,639
we may have a period of time

193
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,400
where the u.s has to consider some

194
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,479
statutory changes

195
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,840
but we just have to rebuild the

196
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,160
foundation

197
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
so that there is the kind of trust that

198
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
the transatlantic relationship really

199
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,960
requires

200
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,960
yeah absolutely and i think we uh we

201
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,479
will have heard uh

202
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,080
from the commission and the u.s

203
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
administration that there is definitely

204
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,120
a handshake

205
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
that's really about to materialize

206
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
through this u.s eu

207
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,280
tech and trade transatlantic council and

208
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,840
there are

209
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,240
many areas where both can collaborate

210
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,199
i have a question actually still on this

211
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,560
uh because you know in your your

212
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
wonderful book tools and weapons which

213
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,039
you published in in 2019

214
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,039
you wrote to regulate technologies that

215
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,360
are bigger than themselves governments

216
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759
will need to work together and indeed

217
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,440
there are various areas for mutual

218
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,639
engagement on which

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,240
you know would be critical for the eu

220
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,759
and the us to work together you know it

221
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:36,240
would be

222
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,720
mutually beneficial in order to pull

223
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
resources you know share each other's uh

224
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,759
us assets and strength and we have many

225
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,479
but it will

226
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,199
also be indispensable for our respective

227
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,680
resilience and our agenda i know the

228
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,240
eu is rooting for strategic autonomy for

229
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,199
instance

230
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,000
now in the pandemic we've seen how our

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
critical systems and our infrastructure

232
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,400
have come under attack you know with

233
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,639
disrupted operations especially towards

234
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
vital infrastructure like hospitals what

235
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,520
are some of the ways in which you

236
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,080
believe

237
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,800
the tech industry and in particular

238
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
microsoft can play

239
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,199
a supportive role in ensuring um you

240
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,199
know more resilience in cyber security

241
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,599
globally but also of course acting as a

242
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,160
bridge

243
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,879
as part of the transatlantic relations

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,400
well i think it's a really

245
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
interesting question and one of the

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,440
things i would just start with

247
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,599
is at a time when there is rightly so

248
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,199
much discussion about digital

249
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,479
sovereignty

250
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,159
we should recognize that there is no

251
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,919
digital sovereignty without

252
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,599
cyber security and we really need to

253
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,000
strengthen cyber security protection

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,720
around the world and across the board um

255
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,800
certainly i think that responsibility in

256
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,160
many ways is on our shoulders

257
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,120
at microsoft and other tech companies we

258
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
need to keep

259
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
strengthening the features that provide

260
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
cybersecurity protection

261
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,839
and i think even more than that we need

262
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,519
to keep making these features

263
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,040
easier for organizations and companies

264
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,920
and governments and individuals to use

265
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,680
the second thing that i just think has

266
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,320
been so

267
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,120
noteworthy over the last six months is

268
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
that every time we've really dug deep to

269
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
understand what happened with the cyber

270
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,320
attack and we

271
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,200
really worked with customers to see you

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
know what had happened within their

273
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,920
networks

274
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,519
what we found was a common trait

275
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,279
people became victims in large part

276
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,600
because they did not necessarily deploy

277
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
all of the protections that exist

278
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,720
already so

279
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
i think we need to help governments and

280
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
businesses large and small

281
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,279
ngos use a short but

282
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
critical list of features if people are

283
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,760
going to run their software on a server

284
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,200
in their own building

285
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
they have to be patching the server

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
better yet they should probably move to

287
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,760
the cloud so they don't have to keep

288
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,680
patching their machines and a

289
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,080
company that runs cloud services will do

290
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
so instead

291
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,480
it's just an imperative that we have

292
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,440
customers

293
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,240
that are using anti-malware and using it

294
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,560
on

295
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,200
all of their machines that they're using

296
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,399
multi-factor

297
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,040
access that they're ensuring their

298
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,959
network administrators

299
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,640
follow what's called lease privilege

300
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,560
access meaning they only have access to

301
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,160
the part of the network that they need

302
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,279
to work on

303
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
yet they're running on the principles of

304
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,600
what we call a zero trust environment

305
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,399
in other words run your network on the

306
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,120
assumption that

307
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,079
someday someone will get inside it but

308
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,040
don't let them run

309
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,560
wild when they're there so you tie down

310
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,800
your devices with the kinds of services

311
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
that we and others

312
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,200
run and perhaps above all else use the

313
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,240
authentication

314
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,279
keys the keys that are used the password

315
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,680
so to speak by your administrators

316
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,000
to you know manage and access your your

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,920
email your documents

318
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,160
store them in a secure location either

319
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
on a secure hardware device or

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
in the cloud if there's one thing that i

321
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
think so

322
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,279
many of the attendees of this meeting

323
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,640
share in common

324
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,279
is that frankly almost all of you are

325
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:09,839
high

326
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,880
on the list of priorities

327
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,560
for an attack we follow this every day

328
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,279
from russia from iran from china from

329
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,399
north korea

330
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,640
and people who work in government people

331
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,040
who work for think tanks people who work

332
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
at ngos

333
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
yeah you need to think about this

334
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,680
because believe me unfortunately

335
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,000
our adversaries are thinking about you

336
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
thank you so much uh brett smith yeah

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,519
it's been a difficult year uh

338
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,240
for you know cyber security but i think

339
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,920
both the eu and the us are taking it

340
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,519
seriously i actually

341
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,480
