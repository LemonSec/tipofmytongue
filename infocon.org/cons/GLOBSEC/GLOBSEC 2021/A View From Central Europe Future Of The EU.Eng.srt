we want

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,919
to talk not about too much about the

47
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,240
past but more about where we are today

48
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
and how you see the future now before we

49
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,479
get started i just want to remind the

50
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,440
audience that

51
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,199
we are very interested in hearing your

52
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,199
questions to the foreign ministers we're

53
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,000
going to try to

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,479
integrate them into this discussion

55
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,440
towards the end

56
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,720

the end

61
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,560
of the discussion so do be thinking

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
about that along

63
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
the way now

64
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,919
to set a baseline for talking about the

65
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,960
future

66
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,600
i would first like to quickly ask each

67
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,720
all each of you

68
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
how you see the eu right now

69
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,039
is the union that we have here today

70
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,199
in the european union uh what your

71
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,800
country imagined

72
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,240
it would be 17 years ago when you

73
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,440
uh joined the eu and if it's not

74
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,680
the way you thought it would be is that

75
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,800
because the eu

76
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
has changed or is it because you have

77
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
changed

78
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
let's start right here with minister

79
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
ciarato

80
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
good afternoon to all of you thank you

81
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,479
very much for invitation ivan

82
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,479
thank you for uh giving us the chance

83
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,479
again for visagrat foreign ministers to

84
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,680
express our

85
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
views here i think that the whole world

86
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,880
has uh

87
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,360
changed it has changed a lot especially

88
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,440
during the recent uh one and a half

89
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,319
years

90
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,000
and i think it's absolutely not an

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
exaggeration to say that

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,039
we are entering a newer new age a new

93
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,240
world order

94
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
both when it comes to global politics

95
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,479
and global economy and what we

96
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,160
understand from the current situation is

97
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,960
that this

98
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,599
new age or this new world order starts

99
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,919
with a very tough competition

100
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,720
a tough competition uh regarding uh

101
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,759
who's gonna be

102
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
strong stronger or the strongest and

103
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
who's going to be the winner of the

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
competition for the redistribution of

105
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
the capacities of the global economy in

106
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,840
the new era

107
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,039
if we look at the share of gdp

108
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,479
we eu do have now it's

109
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,800
unfortunately much less compared to what

110
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,199
we used to have 10 years ago

111
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,759
if we look at the political strength of

112
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,400
ours well

113
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
about this we can debate but regarding

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,000
gdp is definitely about

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,560
figures gdp relative to other countries

116
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,199
they're

117
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,240
too global okay i mean the share of uh

118
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,879
european union's gdp to the global gdp

119
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,400
has shrinked a lot unfortunately

120
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,919
it has many aspects of course because

121
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,080
others have grown much

122
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,000
more quickly but what i think would be

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
the most important now

124
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,840
is to make sure that the european union

125
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,759
is going to be among the winners

126
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,759
of this new age both when it comes to

127
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,599
political strength and when it comes to

128
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,720
uh

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,520
economic power and the way how we can

130
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,319
make eu

131
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,759
strong i would say again is that we make

132
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,720
the member states

133
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,120
themselves strong so you you know we

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
never believed

135
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,240
in the concept called united states of

136
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
europe but we always believed in the

137
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,160
concept of strong eu

138
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,560
based on strong member states and we

139
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
really still do believe that if the

140
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,958
member states are themselves strong

141
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,719
you add them together it will end up in

142
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,399
a strong european union this is our

143
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,958
position okay so competitiveness very

144
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,679
much at the

145
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,919
at the forefront of your perspective on

146
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,880
the eu

147
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,000
uh minister kocha well thank you and

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,920
good afternoon and well welcome to my

149
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,640
colleagues from

150
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,200
uh vishgrad first when entering the room

151
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,360
that that was a very

152
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,399
exceptional feeling because rarely when

153
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,080
v4 show wapsweep are clapping and

154
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
i hope people will be clapping also at

155
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,560
the end of this panel

156
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,160
but you asked about our view 17 years

157
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,200
ago when when we joined european union

158
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,519
in a retrospective and all in all will

159
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,279
with with all the problems i think it's

160
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,959
a success story for my country if you

161
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,600
look around

162
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
how the country looks like certainly

163
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,519
it's because we've been working hard

164
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,519
in order to change our country but i

165
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,279
dare say that without being member of

166
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,720
european union

167
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,480
the outcome would not be that positive

168
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,240
because it opened

169
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,320
the country it has brought new

170
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,839
responsibility to us which is changing

171
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,000
positively

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
the country and it has opened uh

173
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,800
opportunities and economic development

174
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
we joined

175
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,959
eurozone as the only country of of

176
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,080
vishegrad

177
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,600
but certainly one has to see in order to

178
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,040
make the picture

179
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,560
complete that we have not expected when

180
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
we joined that

181
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
a decade more than a decade of a crisis

182
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,120
would be ahead of us and that was

183
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
difficult and that's the legacy we have

184
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,440
to deal with

185
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
also when when talking about the future

186
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,440
because it's fine to talk about

187
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,839
uh what we want to achieve in in the

188
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,160
future but unless we address the issues

189
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,959
which are on the table and that are the

190
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,360
outcome of unresolved crisis

191
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
which we have experienced over the last

192
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,399
10 12 years

193
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,959
we can barely talk about challenges uh

194
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,600
in the future but the overall

195
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,839
overall overall outcome of our

196
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,279
integration i hope i speak on behalf of

197
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,720
slovak citizens

198
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
is a is a very positive one mr kalanick

199
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,760
you of course have watched the eu evolve

200
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,800
too

201
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
you see me younger man than myself so

202
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,640
you have a younger man's perspective

203
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,959
on this what's your feeling about how

204
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,839
the eu

205
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,880
has evolved and what the czech

206
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,480
republic's position is

207
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
in it relative to what you imagined 17

208
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,040
years ago

209
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,320
well first of all thank you for having

210
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,640
me

211
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
um that's a really um welcome

212
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,839
uh uh um a change uh to be sitting here

213
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,120
you know among uh my v4 colleagues but

214
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,320
more importantly

215
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,880
the fact this is uh um uh taking place

216
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
and um and the physical form

217
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,079
uh it's uh quite uh refreshing and

218
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,959
um that's a that's a joyful feeling uh

219
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,920
indeed

220
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
but um you know it's a tricky question

221
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,880
and um uh you know i always say i mean

222
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
you know obviously the obvious answer

223
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
would be yes i mean the eu has evolved

224
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,600
uh

225
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,040
for sure uh but uh and so has your

226
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
country yeah well

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,240
true yeah but the most important uh

228
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,399
thing here is that um you know sometimes

229
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,360
uh i cannot help but think that uh we uh

230
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,000
tend to

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,279
forget uh maybe uh uh what we were uh

232
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,399
getting uh ourselves uh uh into

233
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,600
that is uh uh you know uh a lot of hard

234
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,680
work and and responsibility

235
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,000
uh you know just the the fact that now

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,160
we can sit at the table

237
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,079
in brussels and uh you know this is you

238
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,959
know i mean

239
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,519
it we have this this ownership this is

240
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,040
shared ownership

241
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,600
and uh uh you know it's it's up to us i

242
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,160
mean

243
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,240
uh you know sometimes i feel it hasn't

244
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
quite

245
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,200
sinked in yet uh uh fully but uh you

246
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,839
know with that

247
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,399
with time uh you know i'm very hopeful

248
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,519
uh um

249
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,959
but uh the the most important thing here

250
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,760
is that um uh you know in the years to

251
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,720
come

252
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,320
uh you know i believe uh that uh we will

253
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
um be able to uh sort of uh uh

254
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,240
not not think of you know um you know is

255
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,200
it is it different

256
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,160
is it the you know different eu than we

257
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,120
were hoping for

258
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
but rather i mean it's the the you uh

259
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,800
you know we can

260
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
uh you know it's it the eu will be as we

261
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
we we make make it i mean it's our um uh

262
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,639
it's it's our doing so so so i think um

263
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,200
you know this once we can uh we can

264
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,760
accept

265
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,959
uh uh it will make the whole of uh the

266
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,600
eu

267
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,639
a much better place mr al you've watched

268
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,040
the eu evolve as well poland has also

269
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,720
evolved i was actually there

270
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,320
um where the borders come together

271
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
uh among some of the visigrad states

272
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,600
together with germany

273
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
uh in 2004 and and witnessed this the

274
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,440
succession from that perspective which

275
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
was it was a fascinating and moving

276
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,079
moment

277
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,480
uh poland being a large neighbor of

278
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,240
germany where i live uh this was

279
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,240
a very significant and moving uh

280
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,440
situation there how

281
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
how have you ex how do you have you seen

282
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,839
the eu evolve relative to what your

283
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:46,720
country's

284
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,079
aspirations were your expectations there

285
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,120
because i know it was quite

286
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,839
controversial in poland the idea of even

287
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,639
joining the eu

288
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,839
yes thank you very much let me begin

289
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,399
in the most traditional way of thinking

290
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,920
with globsec and

291
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,760
evan korchok personally for inviting us

292
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,760
and offering this opportunity to discuss

293
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,880
this issue well let me say that i'm

294
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,959
not in a position to agree with you

295
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,639
because

296
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
the issue of joining the eu was not so

297
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,839
controversial in poland the overwhelming

298
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,639
majority

299
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,760
was for joining and still today the

300
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
overwhelming majority

301
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,720
uh one of the highest actually in the eu

302
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
is for our for our uh presence

303
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,680
in in the uu structure so i don't know

304
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,839
from where you are taking this person

305
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,040
i'd be happy to provide you with an

306
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
article that i wrote at the time about

307
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,240
it um where the polling number was okay

308
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,519
anyway

309
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
i appreciate your your knowledge based

310
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
on the articles but uh it's my country

311
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,279
and i know of course

312
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,839
of course uh

313
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,000
17 years ago there was an overwhelming

314
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,560
feeling

315
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,560
in in poland that european union

316
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,199
united europe integrating europe is the

317
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,440
most natural place for us

318
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,320
and this feeling still prevails there is

319
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,880
no

320
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,320
there is no uh question about that

321
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,440
what we expected from the european union

322
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,040
at that time i would say

323
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,399
actually two things two things first

324
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,399
that we are joining a political european

325
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,199
structure

326
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,120
with strong european institutions

327
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,600
which are helping to pursue

328
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,639
the interest of member states at a

329
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,680
strong member states so

330
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,519
it was a community of a cooperation

331
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,320
of mutual understanding based on the

332
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,440
principle of

333
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,639
equality subsidiarity

334
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,680
and proportionality and i suppose that

335
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,639
is exactly

336
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,759
what most of us in poland expect from

337
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,040
the european union

338
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,600
in the future in order to be satisfied

339
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,720
as much as we were 30 17 years ago i

340
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,440
suppose what is absolutely necessary

341
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,480
is is a clear cut distinction between

342
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
the competences

343
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,199
of the european institutions and the

344
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,399
member states

345
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,519
if we manage to do that it's the union

346
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,560
is not going to be

347
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,680
perfect institutionally but something

348
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,000
it's going to be very satisfactory for

349
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,279
every member of state

350
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,240
this is one thing this is now i have

351
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,360
briefly if you don't mind because i'd

352
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,639
like to move on

353
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,000
i would think that we attach an enormous

354
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,959
value to a single market a single market

355
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:51,360
with

356
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,480
its four freedoms because it makes

357
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,279
our economies competitive within the

358
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,480
european union

359
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,279
and the european union competitive envy

360
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,120
in the world which is going to be more

361
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,240
and more complicated

362
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,280
also economically now indeed the region

363
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,039
that you represent here has one of the

364
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:09,359
most

365
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,079
dynamic in the european union it must be

366
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,919
said

367
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,319
so that's setting the stage that's kind

368
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,359
of the baseline

369
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,679
for where we are now and i want to now

370
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,679
start looking towards the future

371
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,959
uh you mentioned minister kochak

372
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,839
that the that the eu has suffered a

373
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,200
number of um

374
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,600
of crises and that you maybe had not

375
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,960
anticipated these crisis that's the

376
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,720
nature of crises right that whether it's

377
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,160
economic or whatever something

378
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,039
happens and very recently uh or just now

379
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,280
indeed we are experiencing a crisis

380
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,440
that is uh shaking the eu to its

381
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,720
foundations

382
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,600
uh not just the eu but the entire world

383
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,360
it must be said

384
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,280
we're talking of course about the the

385
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
pandemic right the pandemic

386
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,039
is has hit us in a way that we

387
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,039
never could have imagined has hit the

388
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
global economy with a lot of talk about

389
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,160
the economy here

390
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,640
it's hit the global economy but also our

391
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,360
entire

392
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,600
the fabrics of our societies how we live

393
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,000
together fundamental freedoms that we

394
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
cherish have been compromised and we are

395
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
slowly coming out of this lockdown which

396
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,360
we can hope will

397
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,919
continue but talking about the forces uh

398
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,320
shaping the eu's evolution right now the

399
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,240
austrian foreign minister this morning

400
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,080
alexander schultenbach

401
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
he um schallenbach he this morning he

402
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,679
suggested that the pandemic though

403
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,080
terrible as terrible as it is it has

404
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
also provided

405
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,640
a positive impetus for the eu

406
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
that it is bringing the eu together

407
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,240
perhaps and

408
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,679
changing it in a way that might be

409
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,760
positive do you see it that way do you

410
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,160
see

411
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
this pandemic that we are in right now

412
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,520
this crisis as it's shaping the eu

413
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,919
the decisions that have been made at

414
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,840
european level on how to deal with it do

415
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
you think this is going to make the eu

416
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,160
stronger

417
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,919
moving forward or not

418
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,520
who would like to begin peter

419
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,320
you guys get together all the time you

420
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,640
you've done this before i know but

421
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,320
i need three more minutes okay look we

422
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,679
always knew that the slovaks were

423
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,600
fantastic and very polite hosts so

424
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,160
you don't you don't disappoint us that's

425
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,650
great

426
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,919
[Music]

427
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,200
look i think that the eu made some

428
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
very good decisions and some very bad

429
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,960
decisions

430
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,679
when it comes to tackling the crisis

431
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,840
let's start with the good one okay

432
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
to be equally polite to uh even

433
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,559
that was europe come on

434
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,039
it was absolutely a good decision to

435
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,400
allow the states

436
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,679
the governments to give financial

437
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,799
incentive to investments

438
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,960
of private companies during the crisis

439
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,520
under much more flexible circumstances

440
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
than during peaceful times

441
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,240
we have taken the advantage of this

442
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
flexibility put forward by the european

443
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,280
commission

444
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
and we decided not to distribute money

445
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,600
on a social basis

446
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,880
but to give investment incentive to

447
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,159
companies

448
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,120
who have agreed to make investments into

449
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
their capacity and or

450
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,840
technology parallely to making a

451
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,559
commitment

452
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,000
not to not to fire anybody and this was

453
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,600
a good decision by european commission

454
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,600
to allow this we have broken investment

455
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
record last year in hungary regardless

456
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,640
of the pandemic because we use that

457
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,320
scheme

458
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,600
what was a bad decision was that um

459
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,039
regarding the procurement of the

460
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,640
vaccines

461
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,799
i think eu proved to be very slow

462
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,679
because um big entities outside of the

463
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,200
european union including the united

464
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,679
kingdom the united states israel

465
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,919
could start the vaccination campaigns of

466
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,120
them much

467
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
more quickly than the european union

468
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,200
could and on the other hand what i think

469
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,919
was

470
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,960
was really a big mistake that the issue

471
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
of vaccines

472
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,159
was considered as of ideological

473
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,159
or geopolitical nature okay i'm sorry

474
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,280
i'm just going to interrupt you if you

475
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,760
don't mind

476
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,960
i'm just going to interrupt you very

477
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
very briefly and put my apologies but um

478
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,360
what i

479
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,080
would like is for you to to think not

480
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
just about like what has gone wrong in

481
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
handling the pandemic but rather

482
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,000
has the pandemic going to lead to any

483
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,280
changes like okay

484
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,880
this was slow this you know the way that

485
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,559
your the eu handled the

486
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,559
procurement of vaccines it was almost

487
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,520
universally criticized the point is

488
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,679
have we will the eu learn from that is

489
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,200
this going to create an

490
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,360
opportunity for reform within the eu

491
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,880
that will shape its future development

492
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,720
in a way that you find

493
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,880
encouraging yeah we definitely do have

494
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,000
to because

495
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
i mean eu does have to change you're

496
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,760
totally right because i think what

497
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,720
uh has become very uh clear that

498
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,600
institutions can lead

499
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,000
the integration very well under peaceful

500
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
circumstances

501
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,120
but when it comes to crisis and when

502
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
it's time to act then we need leaders

503
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,240
and then simply institutions uh cannot

504
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,960
replace

505
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,120
leaders and that's why i think that the

506
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,880
um that the decisions

507
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,919
made on uh on national basis on member

508
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,039
states basis

509
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,080
were extremely important and

510
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,679
i think under um under uh serious uh

511
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,440
emergency situations

512
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,400
uh the room for or the space for

513
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,159
national decisions uh

514
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,720
should be kept free and should not be

515
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,039
let's say taken into consideration as if

516
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:31,919
they were

517
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
means to violate the european unity okay

518
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,440
so i think a healthy

519
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,080
a healthy balance between um between

520
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,880
answers

521
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,360
coordinated by brussels and the answers

522
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,480
based on national

523
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,880
level uh must be kept and i think this

524
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,080
is something that we have to learn from

525
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
this crisis definitely

526
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,840
okay there's a lot more that we could

527
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,200
talk about there uh

528
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,679
vis-a-vis hungary and the eu and uh and

529
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,200
some of the some of the aspects but uh

530
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,480
perhaps we'll get in into that a little

531
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,840
later uh minister

532
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,440
chuck you've had a little a few moments

533
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,960
to think about that um

534
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,480
perhaps you're are you ready i i'm never

535
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
ready to answer

536
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,400
this question because i'm sick and tired

537
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,360
of uh

538
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,159
you know receiving all the time the

539
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,000
question whether crisis air

540
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,120
a or b pandemic now will be the the

541
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,280
point that will change finally

542
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,440
european union for the better and i

543
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,559
don't think any people are

544
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,320
and i don't think it's and i don't think

545
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,000
it's completely appropriate

546
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,039
uh to ask whether the eu or what went

547
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,440
wrong

548
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,280
what was fine with the european union

549
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,600
tell me and show me identify

550
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,799
one state that was prepared for this

551
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,679
pandemic

552
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,679
not that the european union was not able

553
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,400
to deliver masks at the beginning

554
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,440
uh but the states were not ready and

555
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,679
in spite in spite of all the

556
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:49,039
deficiencies and

557
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,159
and you know shortages and problems i

558
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,320
dare say that had we not

559
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,679
entitled european union to procure and

560
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,640
acquire the vaccines collectively for us

561
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,720
individually i don't think slovakia

562
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,159
would be better prepared to

563
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,559
acquire registered vaccines because the

564
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,360
truth is

565
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,799
that there was access but not to

566
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,600
registered vaccines

567
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,159
and hungary has decided we follow then

568
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:14,640
to

569
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,120
go for other vaccines outside of those

570
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,679
were

571
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,159
outside of the european market uh if you

572
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,080
all that but that's reality

573
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,799
two i don't think it's it's so

574
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,640
appropriate to say that eu

575
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,360
was slow because the other day i i in

576
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
france i received the question

577
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,720
that european union acted as if it was

578
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,000
a state you know when it comes to

579
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,640
uh procuring uh vaccines but it took us

580
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,799
60 days and that was a big difference

581
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,720
between united states and united kingdom

582
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
because there was a state

583
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
decision which we have not back then

584
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,159
so those are realities with which we are

585
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,120
facing

586
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,440
and the the change that it may uh

587
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,120
trigger for the future

588
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,799
yes maybe there will be acceptance

589
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,320
amongst member states among

590
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,600
our citizens to uh to give more

591
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,440
competence for the european union when

592
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
it comes to health but there we do have

593
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,080
to

594
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,559
identify what kind of competence we

595
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,120
transfer

596
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,799
on european union when it comes to

597
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,720
health health protection that could be a

598
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,679
lesson but

599
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,159
once again i don't think that this

600
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,039
pandemic with

601
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,240
will be a major a watershed change

602
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,799
uh for us to resolve the problems we've

603
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,760
been facing

604
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,640
over the last 10 or 20 12 years i mean

605
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,360
can we

606
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
resolve all obstacles and probably

607
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,120
remove obstacles within

608
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
internal market which is not properly

609
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,919
functioning irrespective of pandemia

610
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,720
can we complete steal the eurozone which

611
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,640
is a difficult legacy

612
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,279
from from previous uh previous crisis

613
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,039
and you can continue can we improve our

614
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,799
foreign policy because of pandemia i

615
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,840
don't think so

616
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,480
okay what is needed is a determination

617
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
and readiness to act in order to improve

618
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,320
things which do not function

619
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,320
and this is my expectations from the

620
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
upcoming debate

621
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,039
uh within the conference on the future

622
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,640
of european union okay

623
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,159
well still i think it might be

624
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,080
appropriate to to ask this question

625
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,840
about whether this crisis has provided

626
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,240
some

627
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,559
impetus for for change uh positive or

628
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,919
negative um

629
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,559
so i'll i'll continue if uh in unless

630
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:14,960
you're

631
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,279
you know our other guests here have have

632
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,640
uh think otherwise uh

633
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
uh would you like to scare the comment

634
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,760
um minister

635
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
perhaps briefly because i very much

636
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,640
subscribe to what's been said before

637
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,120
uh you know look you know when it comes

638
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,720
to the pandemic

639
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,320
you know one has to realize that it was

640
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,400
it was a wake-up call you know i uh

641
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,000
and and here i would slightly disagree

642
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
with yvonne uh here

643
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,480
very much like uh uh to see this um as a

644
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,600
watershed moment

645
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,400
it won't be probably but uh uh you know

646
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,200
i think uh

647
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,320
it was this you know painful realization

648
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,919
that uh the eu um is ill-equipped

649
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,120
uh uh to uh um

650
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,000
address the uh health crisis of this

651
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,880
magnitude

652
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,159
but look you know we didn't

653
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,320
uh you know nobody planned for that and

654
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
i you know here i agree with you

655
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,520
the uh the the notion that

656
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,000
um you know this was uh you know some

657
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,520
kind of a nation state

658
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,480
uh that that failed it is well uh uh you

659
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,200
know um

660
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,360
i mean that's silly uh you know i i

661
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,559
think um uh

662
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,480
well i mean what what you know i mean

663
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,720
obviously and mistakes were made

664
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,600
uh but but also i i think uh there's

665
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,799
been a lot of

666
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,279
uh you know good and a lot lot of

667
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,720
positive that that's been

668
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,399
that's been accomplished and you know we

669
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
should not lose sight of

670
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,360
of of this and as we as as we move

671
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,240
forward

672
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,640
you know i think you know we should look

673
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,679
at this

674
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,480
as you know lessons learned and make

675
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,200
sure

676
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
that when the next pandemic hits us

677
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,399
we are prepared but you know as as the

678
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,039
as the eu the eu institutions but also

679
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,480
member states so

680
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,760
so i think um as the saying goes um

681
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,000
you know no no no good crisis should go

682
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,760
to waste and we should look at it

683
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,279
that way okay um mr

684
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,440
rao perhaps we want to move on or would

685
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
you like to say something about that

686
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,679
because uh

687
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,240
again minister schallenberg from austria

688
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
was adamant that um there were good

689
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,960
things that were going to come out of

690
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,240
this for the eu

691
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,600
for the future of the eu i'm just

692
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,200
wondering if you if you show that or not

693
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,919
very briefly

694
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,720
kind of a yes or no well i wouldn't like

695
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,120
to

696
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,000
overstate the importance of this

697
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,279
experience it was

698
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,600
it has been a traumatic experience and

699
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,120
from each

700
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,919
such a multi-dimensional experience

701
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,880
smart

702
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,600
leaders and concerned citizens in a

703
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,039
democratic system

704
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,440
can draw their own lessons and as far as

705
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,440
the european union is concerned

706
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,799
i suppose that it this

707
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,399
experience indicates some strengths and

708
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,279
some weaknesses of the european union

709
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,399
for example i'm i'm i'm a supporter of

710
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,559
the subsidiarity

711
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,039
principle and i suppose that the

712
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,880
validity of this principle has been

713
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,679
confirmed

714
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,960
in this in this crisis because if you

715
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,399
if you take for example the

716
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,799
medical infrastructure that had to be

717
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
had to be created

718
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,880
at this spot in order to accommodate the

719
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,039
coveted 19 patients

720
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,480
nobody can replace the local authorities

721
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,039
and

722
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,320
in in in doing that it's so what is

723
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,039
absolutely necessary is to create a

724
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,720
space for a reasonable

725
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,159
activities so if in in poland we

726
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,679
we have a boost now of of uh

727
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,200
e e medical in medical system

728
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,960
right uh there is there are so many

729
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,559
digital uh arrangements considering

730
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,640
medical services and so on

731
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,600
so it can be done well at the bottom

732
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,880
certainly okay when you

733
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,600
think about other things like access to

734
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,080
access

735
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,880
to drugs very often or access to medical

736
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,679
data

737
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,919
of course of course the european union

738
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,080
could be very helpful here okay

739
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,399
it's a matter what i said it's a matter

740
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,720
of a division of competences

741
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,679
and also what is extremely important

742
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,200
it's a human and political attitude here

743
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,039
do you recall the beginning the

744
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,760
beginning of a pandemic in our part of

745
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,200
of europe borders got close

746
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,919
yes this was very unfortunate and what's

747
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,200
the end of that

748
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,600
i'm very proud that the medical staff

749
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,559
from poland

750
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,000
came over here to slovakia to assist the

751
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,080
slovak colleagues in the action of the

752
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,880
vaccinations of many many

753
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,679
many people exactly so this is exactly

754
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,279
the indication that we can

755
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,080
learn in a small way from this kind of

756
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,799
experience

757
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,279
like any other experience very good

758
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:02,720
because there is a lot of talk about

759
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,559
the health union now within at the

760
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,240
european union level and whether

761
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,559
if changes can be made that would allow

762
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,440
this to really

763
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
evolve better because you really insist

764
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,960
on calling this a

765
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,840
health union i mean

766
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,159
anyway i do send some skepticism on the

767
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,440
panel about the uh

768
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,080
about the impact of of the pandemic in

769
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,360
terms of the eu

770
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,200
evolving i want to get on to some other

771
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,240
questions particularly about the

772
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
conference on the future of europe but

773
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,440
uh perhaps minister kulan uh

774
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,200
minister koch and i'll just make a quick

775
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,279
interview what came to my mind when i

776
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,120
was listening to my colleagues who were

777
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
right on everything what they said but

778
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,720
jakub i wish it was right would you say

779
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,279
that it's a it was a wake-up call

780
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,120
my experience says that with each and

781
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
every crisis in the european union the

782
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,480
outcome is a wake-up call and then we

783
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,880
fall asleep

784
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,840
this is the problem because you know

785
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,000
eurozone

786
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,159
what is it migration more or less we're

787
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,840
awakened from time to time

788
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,000
and so on and so on so i i wish that

789
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,080
this time it was a wake up call and

790
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,399
second the more provocative question

791
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,200
i i entirely understand with my friends

792
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,000
bigness who

793
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,919
says you know subsidiarity and

794
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,760
competence and flexibility but

795
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,480
can we identify as we sit here something

796
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,880
where the eu has prevented us from doing

797
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,919
something

798
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,799
i believe the challenge and the failure

799
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:27,440
i could

800
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,519
yes we were under very heavy attack for

801
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,120
months because of buying vaccines from

802
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,799
the east but that's not the question of

803
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,720
competence that was a question of rules

804
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,840
i mean we agreed

805
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,760
we agreed with the european and i'm not

806
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,960
criticizing you

807
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,559
are you what vaccines from the east as

808
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,399
well sorry you bought vaccines from the

809
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,519
east as well

810
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,159
yes after you after the actually after

811
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,279
you

812
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,799
after after you now we helped and i had

813
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,960
and i personally i did yes i know

814
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,399
something about that yeah i'm proud of

815
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:55,440
that and

816
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,640
so we we bought after you decided to

817
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
a good decision but not to follow the

818
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,320
rules that we established within the

819
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,919
european union you opened the door and

820
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,120
this is perfectly

821
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,760
your right yeah gentlemen i'm sorry just

822
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,480
one second

823
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,000
you say that you say that we didn't

824
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,200
follow the rules but you know the

825
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,120
european regulation says

826
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,679
that there are two ways a vaccine can be

827
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,600
approved in the european union either by

828
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,559
ema

829
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,679
or under uh emergency circumstances by

830
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:22,880
the national regulators

831
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,039
so what we have done was it has been and

832
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,720
is enshrined in the european uh

833
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,600
regulations

834
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,760
and look we were not ready to look at

835
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,880
the vaccines as

836
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,960
ideological or geopolitical nature but

837
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,279
as tools for saving lives of the people

838
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,440
and the fact that we are at 65 percent

839
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,120
of vaccination rate and we

840
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,799
we were the first country in eu to open

841
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,960
up economy was was mostly thanks to our

842
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,760
quick steps

843
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,200
at the beginning and i don't feel that

844
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,799
we would have violated

845
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,360
any common rule or um any common

846
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,559
agreement because

847
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,399
it was not said that you are not allowed

848
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,559
to buy vaccines from anywhere else we

849
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,960
subscribe to the europeans

850
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,000
i'm afraid i'm going to have to

851
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,919
interrupt you thank you thank you both

852
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,559
yourself

853
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,440
against the regulations

854
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,039
i sense i sense that there's a need for

855
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,119
further discussion on this topic

856
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,119
between the two countries there and i'm

857
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,560
sure those those discussions will

858
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,918
continue but um

859
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,760
what you know we are talking about the

860
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
future of europe here there's been a lot

861
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,399
of discussion of course about the

862
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,000
vaccine procurement and you know who's

863
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,199
buying what from whom under what

864
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,480
conditions but

865
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,399
moving forward uh there's something that

866
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,079
we absolutely have to talk about here

867
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,760
today because it involves everyone in

868
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,119
the european union uh

869
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,560
ostensibly and that is the conference

870
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,760
on the future of europe this is um

871
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,520
this has been described as as the one of

872
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,320
the largest

873
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,239
public consultations one of the biggest

874
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,000
exercises in cons

875
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,879
in deliberative democracy uh on the

876
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,480
continent and i wanted to

877
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,719
get your opinions on that the conference

878
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,079
on the future of europe

879
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,639
the if you're everyone in the room is

880
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,000
probably aware of this

881
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,160
that there is supposed to be this rather

882
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,079
long detailed process that is going to

883
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,160
gather input from the citizens of the

884
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,280
european union

885
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,400
and these this input is supposed to

886
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,480
turn into the form of recommendations

887
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,680
which

888
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,960
at the end could be perhaps should be

889
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,560
written into european law now

890
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,200
the question is what what do the member

891
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,240
states think of this

892
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,160
how how do the states of central europe

893
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,760
how do the visigrad

894
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,839
group countries see that what do you

895
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,119
make of this cons

896
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,960
this conference on the future of the

897
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,240
europe is it going to going to be

898
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,960
valuable or not where should we begin i

899
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,160
think i'll start at the other end of the

900
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,720
panel

901
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,119
um first since we've uh had a little

902
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,240
finally more conversation here

903
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,800
okay thank you my strong

904
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,520
impression is that thinking about the

905
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,960
future of europe

906
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,400
we should look at the european union

907
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,599
from the perspective of citizens not

908
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,920
from the perspective of politicians

909
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,880
not from the perspective of those who

910
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,160
consider themselves

911
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,920
reformers but from the perspective of a

912
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,200
of the citizens

913
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,960
as it should be in any democratic

914
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,480
entity and that's what this conference

915
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,040
supposedly is exactly exactly

916
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,079
so i i i dare to believe

917
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,880
that for example the average for the

918
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,480
average

919
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,520
european citizens such issues how to

920
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,240
structure or restructure european

921
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,960
parliament

922
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,160
whether to have a head candidate spitzen

923
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,119
candidate

924
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,650
or they have to

925
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,839
[Music]

926
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,440
transnational lists it's now

927
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,640
as important as the clear-cut division

928
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,160
of competences

929
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,119
between between the member states and

930
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,320
the

931
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,720
and the european institutions whether

932
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,839
administrative or judicial

933
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,640
institutions this is this is the bottom

934
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,440
line because

935
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,839
we have to talk about things that people

936
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:02,640
understand

937
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,160
the other thing the other thing

938
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,280
is very i suppose what we have to work

939
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,400
upon

940
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,000
in the future is the true is the true

941
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,720
single market that doesn't

942
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,800
discriminate anyone for

943
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,040
in the in the european in the european

944
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,079
union so

945
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,920
everybody is treated is treated

946
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,800
fairly whether it's from a big country

947
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,640
or a small country

948
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,079
and if you launch a company in one

949
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,520
country

950
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,760
and you are from another one so you have

951
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,560
every

952
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,480
right to compete according to the to the

953
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,040
european rules and the other thing

954
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:45,839
extremely

955
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,119
important is the issue that has been

956
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,400
brought up by the notion of

957
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,520
so sovereign autonomy

958
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,400
it's a very questionable issue i

959
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,079
understand that it

960
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,160
has been brought up because people

961
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,680
expect it

962
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,240
because remember states won't want to

963
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,520
discuss it

964
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,560
but we have a to decide what kind of

965
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,920
dimension this

966
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,480
this kind of autonomy is going to be if

967
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,440
it has to

968
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,720
if it's going to be a have a

969
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,160
an economic dimension i welcome it very

970
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,200
very much so because i want europe and

971
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,480
every member state in europe be

972
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,680
competitive

973
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,040
but if it's going to has a military

974
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,800
dimension for example

975
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,000
with an intention to replace for example

976
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,640
some elements of the structure of the

977
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,839
of of nato realistically

978
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,640
i'm not in favor of it because our

979
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,839
military resources of the european union

980
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,040
this doesn't need much proof are more

981
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,000
than

982
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,640
more than limited okay so that's if the

983
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,079
if we do have conclusions coming out of

984
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,760
the consultation on this conference on

985
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,400
the future

986
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,400
of europe that uh in your opinion

987
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,160
would undermine your country's

988
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,640
sovereignty with respect to

989
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,520
defense on the one hand uh that would

990
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,200
not be good but if it were purely to

991
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,079
make it more competitive

992
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,400
on the economic side that might be okay

993
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,599
um minister kulanek

994
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,680
we do need to move along i would really

995
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,960
like to get your views on this because i

996
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,240
want to bring in some questions and we

997
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,079
only have about 12 minutes left

998
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,680
okay okay i'll try to be brief

999
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,920
i suppose i i take it uh we give is

1000
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,520
quite eager to participate

1001
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,520
and and the conference on the future of

1002
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,040
europe um

1003
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,320
which is good um but this this might be

1004
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,880
a

1005
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,320
a bit of a silly stunt but uh how

1006
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,720
many of you in this room actually know

1007
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,320
about uh uh

1008
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,359
this uh uh conference this uh uh

1009
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,480
uh endeavor by uh uh european

1010
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,440
union and and perhaps more importantly

1011
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,240
how

1012
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,160
many people outside of this room

1013
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,359
actually uh know

1014
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,440
um about this um uh

1015
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,720
quite worthwhile undertaking but uh

1016
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,680
you know i i mean i i'd be uh you know

1017
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,800
perhaps a bit

1018
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,839
skeptical uh uh you know um uh

1019
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,040
and uh you know hence it uh you know

1020
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,599
my answer i mean i i think this is uh

1021
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,359
this is great um

1022
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,079
uh you know we we should have it but uh

1023
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,599
you know i wish

1024
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,880
we would try to uh

1025
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,079
bring the eu closer

1026
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,520
to its uh citizens and really i i i

1027
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,240
believe that

1028
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,920
you know putting european citizens at

1029
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,280
the forefront

1030
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,560
uh you know of this uh uh discussion

1031
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,920
uh uh is uh what uh the eu uh

1032
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,040
needs above all and maybe using it uh

1033
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,400
to raise awareness about

1034
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,599
what the eu means to

1035
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,960
individual citizens that's that's the

1036
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,760
way

1037
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,119
forward so i you know i think and

1038
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,520
it's you know i guess up on us also uh

1039
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,880
you know to make sure that

1040
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,800
uh um you know more and more people

1041
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
actually know about this process

1042
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,440
and and so you know encourage people to

1043
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:13,760
to

1044
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,319
uh take power you both see it as as good

1045
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,640
in principle

1046
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,160
as long as it kind of aligns with your

1047
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,920
own country's interests it sounds like

1048
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,960
to a degree although that's

1049
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,560
not what i'm hearing from you is jolly

1050
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,000
good but you know i

1051
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,640
i i feel we should encourage people uh

1052
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,000
you know to take people

1053
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,119
to take part in um any any other

1054
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,160
thoughts on this i mean i

1055
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,000
just perhaps perhaps this is not really

1056
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,680
on your radar screen the conference on

1057
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,800
the future of your own

1058
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,160
no of course it is on peter's right

1059
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,319
mostly no no no no yes let's be serious

1060
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,000
my sophisticated answer is we'll see

1061
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,240
i don't know because we promised to our

1062
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,920
citizens

1063
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,560
uh right after we stood in a shock after

1064
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,839
british referendum

1065
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,079
uh in june 2016 and later on in

1066
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,240
september 2016 that we would

1067
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,960
come up fairly soon with an answer about

1068
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,720
the future of european union and since

1069
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,119
then

1070
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,760
almost six years have elapsed already

1071
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,960
and we're still

1072
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,520
about to launch a conference of which we

1073
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,640
expected people

1074
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:19,280
in in jumbo in chrome i don't know

1075
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
they'll be coming up with bright ideas

1076
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,440
about the future are we not naive

1077
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,240
i don't think it will work that way okay

1078
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,119
no no

1079
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,400
we no we will we will be engaged in that

1080
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,480
i my intention is to travel across

1081
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,920
slovakia

1082
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,800
and speak to people but you know it will

1083
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,079
be

1084
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,480
barely possible and realistic to gather

1085
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,760
that many people

1086
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,839
somewhere in the in east of slovakia and

1087
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,200
south of slovakia

1088
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,119
and elsewhere to discuss europe and once

1089
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,079
you gather those people unless you speak

1090
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:52,560
like we do there is silence okay there

1091
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,599
is silence

1092
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,240
so it's a bit you know my expectations

1093
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
are very limited for that at the end of

1094
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,040
the day it

1095
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,960
it is about political responsibility

1096
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,079
what we need more

1097
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,640
than yet another conference is action

1098
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,240
okay within european union

1099
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,720
because what has amassed on our table in

1100
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,359
terms of problems that we are facing

1101
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,040
it's clearly it has been clearly

1102
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,200
identified we've been we

1103
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,800
all the time we've been circumventing

1104
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,480
those problems i'm a bit

1105
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,160
controversial and more provocative but

1106
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,599
where else if not here

1107
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,280
at the at the conference should we speak

1108
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,280
that way so we'll

1109
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,440
we'll try our best but at the end of the

1110
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,240
day it is about political responsibility

1111
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,880
to do

1112
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,800
things which for which maybe people will

1113
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,040
not upload us but if politicians are

1114
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,480
responsible they'll be doing those

1115
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,040
things

1116
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,720
you know i appreciate your candor uh

1117
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,920
which is one of the great things about

1118
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,599
this globe sag forum is that we get

1119
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,160
we're hearing people of your stature uh

1120
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,000
speaking your mind about things uh and i

1121
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,280
know that's not always so easy for

1122
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,480
diplomats right

1123
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,839
uh and you are your country's top

1124
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,400
diplomats um uh minister senator

1125
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,000
just a few words before i put one

1126
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,440
question from the audience i just have a

1127
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,720
short remark here

1128
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,760
uh the future of europe does not equal

1129
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,119
the future of the european union

1130
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:01,920
definitely so

1131
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
if we say future of europe this means

1132
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,280
that we have to include those who are in

1133
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,280
europe but not in the european union

1134
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,760
we i think sharing this stage share an

1135
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,200
opinion about the importance of

1136
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,920
enlargement

1137
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,640
uh it would not be an exaggeration

1138
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,640
either to say that now you see the most

1139
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,079
pro-enlargement countries

1140
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,640
of the european union uh on the stage

1141
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,720
and i do believe that uh countries from

1142
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,960
the western balkans who have been uh

1143
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,599
candidates uh for a long time should

1144
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,240
also be

1145
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,280
uh included in north macedonia yeah we

1146
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,079
don't think that

1147
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,400
the um that the mission which is called

1148
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,000
creating european union would be

1149
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,079
complete without the western volcanoes

1150
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,680
it's very let's say

1151
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,839
unnatural that they are not part of

1152
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,040
european union

1153
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:45,040
and to be honest we are very very

1154
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
disappointed with the fact that in the

1155
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,240
recent years

1156
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,760
just some very very minimal successes

1157
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,560
were reached

1158
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,359
on the territory of enlargement um you

1159
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,040
have to count how many chapters were

1160
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:57,839
open and close

1161
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,480
basically very close to zero to next

1162
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,599
week there's going to be the

1163
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,000
igc's with serbia and montenegro of

1164
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:04,880
course another

1165
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,200
very limited success unfortunately so

1166
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,640
what we hope for is

1167
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,200
that our decision makers will include

1168
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,720
the countries of the western balkans

1169
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,640
into this series of conferences as well

1170
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,720
okay we've also had a question coming in

1171
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,960
i've just noticed in our app about

1172
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,400
people are very interested in knowing

1173
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,240
what your positions are on

1174
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,800
uh the accession possibilities of

1175
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,520
ukraine

1176
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,400
and belarus um at this point if i mean

1177
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,359
if any of you really

1178
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,440
have a strong statement on that i would

1179
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,040
welcome that otherwise i'd like to get

1180
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,480
some questions coming

1181
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,280
from the audience here uh do we have any

1182
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,160
questions here

1183
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,160

event today that the eu will be one of

1204

the winners of the new age

1205
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,040
do you think the eu can be a winner when

1206
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,800
some member states do things like

1207
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,400
undermine eu law or go against real core

1208
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,240
principles of the european union such as

1209
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,839

00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,760
you think

1221
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,280
why don't you pose the question as you

1222
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,520
really mean it do you think that

1223
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,720
uh poland and hungary we do violate the

1224
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,720
freedom of press and on what basis do

1225
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,440

1226
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,359

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:16,480
freedom of press what regulations

1228
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,960

1230
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,319
the i would be grateful if you could

1231
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,520

1232
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,359
answer the questions but i mean we have

1233
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,040
to okay okay but we have to be brave in

1234
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,880
the audience we have to be uh brave

1235
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,480
enough to name things um

1236
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,720
as they are uh i do believe that

1237
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,680
european union

1238
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,880
can be winner of this uh new age

1239
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,040
but but there's one precondition for

1240
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,920
that

1241
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,200
many but one for sure that we stop

1242
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,880
judging lecturing each other we stop

1243
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,520
interfering into domestic issues of each

1244
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,319
other

1245
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:53,359
and we bring back the um policies of

1246
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:54,400
european union

1247
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,880
based on mutual respect and we don't

1248
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,599
think

1249
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,079
that we know things better of another

1250
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,040
country

1251
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,720
than the people there themselves respect

1252
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,880
and we do have to respect the decisions

1253
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,880
the democratically made decisions

1254
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,680
of other countries and if we can stop

1255
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,720
accusing

1256
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,240
each other and we can stop attacking

1257
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,559
each other on a political basis then i

1258
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,319
think european union can be a winner and

1259
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,680
i hope it will be a winner

1260
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,040
of the new um uh global age

1261
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,280
and we will we will work for that i

1262
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,160
would just uh

1263
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,079
bring a follow-up to that maybe uh with

1264
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,240
respect with the word respect

1265
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,480
um because there's you can respect a

1266
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,760
country but there are

1267
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,800
also principles that are enshrined in

1268
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,680
in europe uh european principles and i'm

1269
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,400
just wondering

1270
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,520
to what how you balance those out uh

1271
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,440
how you balance respect for countries

1272
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,280
sovereignty with respect for the

1273
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,599
principles that are enshrined in the eu

1274
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,520
charter would anyone like to reflect on

1275
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,720
that

1276
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,920
myself yeah well uh if

1277
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,119
you know that someone else is

1278
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,960
volunteering we who have been part of

1279
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,640
the european union

1280
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,359
we share the same values and we have to

1281
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,000
respect

1282
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,200
the same regulations and i think that

1283
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,480
all the countries who have been

1284
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,480
represented on this stage

1285
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,319
are respecting the regulations uh

1286
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:18,400
on which the european union is based

1287
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,440
upon the rule of

1288
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,079
respect and we do respect the uh

1289
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,160
sovereignty of ourselves and others

1290
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,079
uh as well including rule of law

1291
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,440
absolutely you know

1292
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,839
we have been under communist occupation

1293
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:35,119
31 years ago we had to fight for our

1294
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:35,920
freedom

1295
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,960
we did fight for our uh freedom we are

1296
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,760
proud

1297
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,079
to be a democratic country and we will

1298
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,000
never accept we will never accept

1299
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,880
anybody to challenge whether we have a

1300
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,640
proper functioning democracy

1301
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,960
or not if there are concrete issues if

1302
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,480
there are concrete issues

1303
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,079
which you would like to discuss we are

1304
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:56,079
always ready always open and always

1305
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,160
ready article 7 procedure has been going

1306
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,599
on for how long has been

1307
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,920
a year more than that you know all the

1308
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,760
questions were raised we answered all of

1309
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,400
them

1310
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,160
why the procedure is not being closed

1311
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,319
why regardless of the fact that all

1312
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:09,760
questions were raised and all questions

1313
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,680
were answered because it's political

1314
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,359
and this is an interest of the liberal

1315
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,040
mainstream to have

1316
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,640
the article seven procedure and the

1317
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,160
continuous attacks against two

1318
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,680
conservative patriotic christian

1319
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,880
democratic governments

1320
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,559
to go on okay so there are different

1321
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,839
views on this in the european union

1322
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,680
he was just uh showing some interest

1323
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,440
before we move on to you okay and we

1324
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,319
only have a couple of minutes

1325
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,599
unfortunately but this is such an

1326
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,559
important part

1327
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,400
that we need raising a very important

1328
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,680
question and the

1329
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,800
answer is very simple especially when it

1330
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,760
comes from our part of europe

1331
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,160
as peter has indicated

1332
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,720
given our past we know what it's what it

1333
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,359
is the

1334
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:55,440
freedom of the media the freedom of

1335
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,119
press because i was

1336
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,000
people of my generation were busy

1337
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,319
producing

1338
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:04,960
newspapers into underground we were

1339
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,240
ready to pay the highest price for vets

1340
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,200
five seven years in jail and so on and

1341
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:11,920
so on

1342
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,559
and i don't recall that one one

1343
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,359
newspaper

1344
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:18,319
one news underground newspaper was

1345
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,880
denouncing another one that it's not

1346
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,119
free enough and so on and so on so we

1347
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,800
only have about we have a value

1348
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,400
sorry we only have about two minutes

1349
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,040
okay we have the value of pluralism

1350
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,160
in our dna and that's we believe

1351
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,880
that the european union if it's going to

1352
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,839
succeed

1353
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,760
it has it has to respect the value of

1354
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,040
pluralism

1355
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,599
i disagree with you because you have

1356
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:44,559
different views

1357
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,760
than i am then i have have so

1358
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,640
i can i can criticize your point of view

1359
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,559
and i'm not going to condemn you

1360
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,040
i'm not going to preach anything to you

1361
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,760
and i'm

1362
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,960
not going to assume that

1363
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,119
your contribution to democracy is

1364
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,400
smaller than mine

1365
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,440
okay because your prime minister

1366
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,079
your prime minister enjoys the same see

1367
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,559
the same political support among his

1368
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:11,280
voters

1369
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,400
as mine in mind so start

1370
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,440
start respecting that okay so respect is

1371
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,800
obviously a very key principle i'm sorry

1372
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,760
to interrupt you here but

1373
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,280
we are absolutely out of time and i just

1374
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,640
want to bring minister korchak in

1375
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,760
because i know that he did

1376
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,079
have a point he wanted to make there um

1377
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,839
just once if one sentence if you like to

1378
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:28,319
comment

1379
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,680
i'm fine with press but

1380
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,760
although it's tough in slovakia price is

1381
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,880
very tough

1382
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,720
but two i want to say on the record i

1383
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,800
don't think that the eu is depriving us

1384
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,119
of

1385
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,280
our freedom i i think it's on the

1386
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,319
contrary

1387
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:44,960
sorry who said that the eu is depriving

1388
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,000
world i'm okay

1389
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,359
i can turn here okay it was no no no

1390
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,640
wait it's big no no

1391
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,559
it's a neutral statement because from

1392
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,400
time to time

1393
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,119
we hear voices from central europe as if

1394
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,480
european union

1395
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,400
would be a source of problem and i don't

1396
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,240
think that's the case european union by

1397
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
far is not a perfect project but

1398
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:09,599
over the last years uh the the

1399
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,319
once again the voices are loud and i

1400
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,000
i've been confronted and i don't

1401
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,839
like it with kind of you bashing

1402
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:20,000
okay but that is going to be the final

1403
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,440
point

1404
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,559
and i'm sorry we're gonna have to leave

1405
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,000
it there i'm hearing in my ear that we

1406
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,760
absolutely have to get out of the room

1407
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,040
it has started now and

1408
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,240
and we we we pluralism and respect a

1409
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,920
warm round of applause for both of those

1410
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,640
principles

1411
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,240
and all four of our foreign ministers

1412
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,879
with us today

1413
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,319
i really want to thank you for for

1414
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:56,079
engaging with the topics we

1415
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,599
really got going there towards the end

1416
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,040
and i have a feeling we could have gone

1417
00:53:59,040 --> 00:53:59,920
on for at least

1418
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,520
another hour or so and i hope to have

1419
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,880
the opportunity to speak with each of

1420
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,079
you individually um

1421
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,880
as in the future but uh right now i do

1422
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,839
need to introduce the the next
