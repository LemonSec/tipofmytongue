1
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,350
in my opinion the most important

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,480
question we have to resolve in Europe

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:15,910
right now is to answer to what extent

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,480
there is life inside the European Union

5
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:23,830
and outside eurozone one way we play

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,810
under the UK is on his way to leave the

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:29,979
European Union and it was a very

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:34,500
significant player also in economic

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:38,769
questions and at least very close to our

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:42,160
mentality to carry out economic reforms

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:44,649
and economic policymaking and from this

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:51,339
point of view it was our everyday still

13
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:55,590
close ally in doing anglo-saxon economic

14
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:59,800
policies so right now the question is

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:03,489
what the euro European Union can offer

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,910
to member state still inside but outside

17
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:11,850
the euro area and for the euro area the

18
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:14,979
main issue to resolve is what extent

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,789
centralized more some of the processes

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:22,600
and create a kind of a more integrated

21
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:27,450
Europe or on the other hand or otherwise

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:32,530
to build on the existing foundations and

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:37,140
try to strengthen the current walls and

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:40,390
not dream about something which has no

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,420
political support in some of the Member

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,420
States
