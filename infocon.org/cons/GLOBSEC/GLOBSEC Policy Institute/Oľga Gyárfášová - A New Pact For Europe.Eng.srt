1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:08,350
slow public always was and still is very

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:12,129
much in favor of the european union

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:15,610
membership so it did not change so much

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:18,009
after the break seat and i can call the

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:21,430
very recent public opinion poll which

6
00:00:18,009 --> 00:00:23,700
said that more than sixty percent of

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,919
those of executions would vote for

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,738
remain and only something more than

9
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:33,330
twenty would vote for leaving the

10
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:36,970
european union so that means that still

11
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:40,030
european project is very popular and

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:43,989
failure going slovakia in spite of the

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:49,210
fact that of course within last three

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:52,630
four years we saw certain decline but as

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:56,610
I said still inside maybe majority of

16
00:00:52,630 --> 00:01:02,140
public key sir for yes staying remaining

17
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:05,800
within the EU maybe to be more specific

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:11,440
about public opinion it's necessary to

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:13,960
add that today the support is Morgan for

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,759
more qualified but on the other hand

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,570
it's still a subject or based mostly on

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,120
a coma

23
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:26,500
and social benefits which European Union

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:30,010
brings to Sobek citizen so that means

25
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:34,119
these are earphones these are labor

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:38,619
market opportunities and jobs outside

27
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:43,990
the country much less it's it is based

28
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:48,009
on values on solidarity and on feeling

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:51,130
of solving common European problems

30
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:55,360
together it's one of the factors which

31
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:58,350
are responsible for that I see or among

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,210
the factors I see also the way how the

33
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,710
national political elites communicate

34
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:08,649
the agenda so that means that there are

35
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,250
pointing and you when something is

36
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:16,930
wrong and are taking the ownership if

37
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:20,880
there are some successes and maybe this

38
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:25,930
is not open euro skeptical rhetoric but

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:30,459
the increase in placentia accent or

40
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:35,070
implicit great line in the communication

41
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:35,070
is undermining support
