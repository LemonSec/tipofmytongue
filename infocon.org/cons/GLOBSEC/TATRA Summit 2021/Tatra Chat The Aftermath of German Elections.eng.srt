tv journalists presenters moderators and

in fact today i'm the moderator and he's

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
the speaker

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,560
um

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,520
so uh without further ado let me just

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
introduce this whole thing with um

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,439
a question

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,280
actually what i would call the new

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,960
german question you know during the cold

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,479
war the german question was the relation

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,240
between the two german states the new

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,159
german question is

37
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
can and will germany pull its weight

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
schaffenville does

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,840
and it is it has so much in common with

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
the old german question

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,920
in the sense that

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,320
a it affects the rest of europe this is

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,479
not just about germany and b it's

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,240
completely open

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,119
and

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,840
i want to first turn to ali who followed

47
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
the campaign actually interviewed all

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
the major candidates of the german

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,479
parties

50
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,600
and i want to ask you the opinion polls

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,360
and forecasts

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
from the beginning of the year till

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,960
about the month of july

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,360
were wildly different already but they

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,038
were completely different from what we

56
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,520
got on the evening of the 26th of

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,319
september how come what has changed how

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,200
has this campaign panned out ali over to

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,080
you

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
thank you so much i think you can pretty

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,480
much shortly sum it up with the botched

62
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,680
campaigns

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,959
uh let's start

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,640
let's several for that matter let's

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
start with amin lashit who of course was

66
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
the candidate of the cdu and uh poised

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,599
to uh to succeed chance america after 16

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,239
years in power to say that he ran a

69
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,920
lackluster campaign i think is

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
diplomatically put

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
people did not warm up to him and most

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,760
importantly

73
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,000
his own party did not warm up to him i

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,200
think

75
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,760
he more than anything the internal

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,239
attacks that he had to suffer uh from

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,120
his rival marco soda the csu but also

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
from from other conservative sides from

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,760
within his party certainly undermined

80
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,640
his authority in holland and and uh

81
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,959
the one thing that probably didn't mean

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,000
was you know we in the summer we had uh

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,640
the flood catastrophe in north rhine

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,400
westphalia and it just shows as a

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,239
journalist you know this the power of

86
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,000
photos the power of images and and

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,519
so basically you have this image where

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,400
the president of germany uh frankfurt

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
steinmeier is speaking in very somber

90
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,760
terms

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,080
about the flood catastrophe

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,239
expressing his condolences and then you

93
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
have a candidate army lashed in the

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
wings and nothing to do with what

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,080
steiner was saying but

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,840
laughing and laughing about a joke that

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,799
one of his advisers made um that a lot

98
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,720
of people thought was in poor taste i i

99
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,480
happen to agree

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
of course completely unrelated to the

101
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
flush catastrophe but it shows the power

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
of pictures and images and at the very

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
latest hold on from there on his

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
campaign i think never

105
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,840
found its footing again annalina berbock

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,519
when she was announced as the green

107
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,439
canada for the very first time in the

108
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,760
history post-world war ii in germany you

109
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,319
had a very realistic chance of a green

110
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,480
party chancellor

111
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,879
really realistic chance and i i remember

112
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,200
the first week after she was announced

113
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,160
she

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,238
her face of course was on covers of all

115
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,839
german magazines of all european

116
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,040
magazines uh the epitome that's when you

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,400
know how you made it when you're being

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,520
interviewed by christian amanpour

119
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,000
was she was on that program and the sky

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
was the limit a young

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,440
intelligent dynamic woman with the right

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,560
agenda climate change uh diversity and

123
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,400
so on so forth well turns out

124
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,919
unfortunately for her um that

125
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,400
she wasn't quite as careful with her cv

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,440
online

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,680
and you know there are very few things

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
then then germans excuse

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,840
more than a very unprecise cv

130
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,160
and you know we as the masters of

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
precision the germs did not appreciate

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,400
that what many perceived to be she

133
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,280
inflated her cv

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,360
whereas i think it was unnecessary on

135
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
her part because it's clear she was

136
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
barely 40 years old it's clear that

137
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
she's not going to come from this long

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,759
line of accomplishments it's clear that

139
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,680
she's a young fresh face i think that's

140
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,320
what was part of her allure but

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,199
so

142
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,080
the plagiarisms of her book again you

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,320
could argue as an earthquake why would

144
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,160
you even need a book like that at a time

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
like this and then to wrap it up

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
hollande of course the spd and olaf

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,720
schwarz who trust me

148
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,919
trust me

149
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,919
five six months ago elma broke will

150
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,680
agree with me who just

151
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,280
long time

152
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
european parliament's

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,560
member

154
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,440
nobody six months ago would have bet two

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
cents on olaf schultz on being the next

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
german chancellor which

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,039
if nothing very very unforeseen happens

158
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,880
this is what we're going to get and i

159
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
think olaf choice you can take this as a

160
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
compliment what i'm about to say you can

161
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,919
take this as a criticism for i just

162
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,960
throw it out there i i think he was a as

163
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
the german say de la chris the laughing

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,000
third one while analina bearbox and i

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
mean luscious campaign

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,039
folded throughout weeks and months and

167
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,360
he was very smart by adopting chance

168
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,120
america's tactics of

169
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
never becoming and getting too concrete

170
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,800
about any issues uh that that by the way

171
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,560
emma broke is a

172
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,600
uh is a tactic that has served uh angela

173
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
merkel very well for 16 years of uh not

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,080
get

175
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
becoming very concrete not making

176
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,960
promises

177
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,160
taking politics on a day by day as or

178
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
seeing it as a day by day discipline

179
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
um and

180
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,360
really epitomizing what klauswitz said

181
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,919
making politics the art of the possible

182
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,599
not of wishful thinking and now hold on

183
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,319
to hand it over to you what we have now

184
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,520
is

185
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,759
a social democratic party which was all

186
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,039
left for debt six months ago we have a

187
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,160
candidate

188
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
who interestingly enough

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
uh had its own share of scandals as

190
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
german finance minister but frankly

191
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,520
speaking those were scandals quote

192
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
unquote that the german public either

193
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,319
didn't understand nor cared about

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
plagiarism is something everybody on the

195
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,160
streets gets a laughing person emit a

196
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,639
flood catastrophe is an image everybody

197
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,000
gets try to explain why a cart try to

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,840
explain the wire card scanner to the

199
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,280
average german even i as a journalist

200
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
had to sort of immerse myself to fully

201
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,039
understand what is happening so we have

202
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,319
now uh that is really the short recap of

203
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,080
what happened olaf schwartz as being the

204
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,560
laughing third yeah great just before we

205
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,960
turn to georgina one tiny follow-up the

206
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,240
one party you haven't mentioned is the

207
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,800
liberals and there was one surprising

208
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,960
figure in these elections among first

209
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,479
voters

210
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,240
the uh the two parties closely uh on the

211
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,160
same level and both leading the whole

212
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,080
pack were the greens and the liberals

213
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,599
how come the liberals are suddenly so

214
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,599
popular with young people in germany

215
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,520
that is truly speaking that is a

216
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
phenomenon that i personally don't fully

217
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,840
get

218
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,599
you know because they are maybe they're

219
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,879
just cool

220
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
you know obviously they have a party

221
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
leader charismatic party leader and

222
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,400
christian lindner who poses in white

223
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,280
t-shirts and and a beard and and is is

224
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
by all accounts objectively speaking a

225
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,159
good-looking man but does that account

226
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,399
for why the young people vote for him uh

227
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,880
i i don't know it could be even some

228
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
have suggested even on the young young

229
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,479
part

230
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,760
not everybody is is marching with

231
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
fridays for future right i mean i think

232
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,959
there are

233
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,440
young people within germany as well who

234
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,519
believe that climate change is important

235
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,880
but for whom

236
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,720
it's also extremely important that the

237
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,800
german economic engine keeps running

238
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
exactly let me now turn to georgina and

239
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,480
uh in 2011

240
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,240
polish then foreign minister radek

241
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,279
chikorski famously said in berlin

242
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,920
today i'm less afraid of german power

243
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,480
than of german inactivity

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,440
um and i mean he he almost faced a a

245
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,160
parliamentary inquiry about this because

246
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
the nationalist opposition at the time

247
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,279
hated him for saying that he meant it at

248
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,440
the time about the euro crisis it was it

249
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,959
was coined on

250
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,760
germany's austerity policy

251
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,880
um

252
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,440
but today it might as well be a played

253
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,519
even by radik chikovsky

254
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,080
also about on on german defense and

255
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,440
security

256
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
on a german vision for europe on

257
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,959
german innovation in the country itself

258
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,279
so georgina what are the expectations in

259
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,440
paris and brussels from this probable

260
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
next government you know i think that's

261
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
extremely good strategic foresight

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,519
because that is the question that

263
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
everyone in paris is asking themselves

264
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,720
what is germany going to do differently

265
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,839
or is the new chancellor simply going to

266
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,760
solidify merkel's legacy and that is the

267
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
question that everyone's asking look if

268
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,160
you just take a step back and consider

269
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
merkel as a leader she was undeniably a

270
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,279
leader in europe but i do wonder whether

271
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,760
that was by necessity rather than by

272
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,440
choice you know there were those very

273
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
very tricky

274
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,160
moments in the eu's recent history and

275
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,760
merkel was the one to kind of bang the

276
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
heads together in the council to get

277
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,079
that approval is that part of her own

278
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,160
experience domestically where coalition

279
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,920
building and consensus building is such

280
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,440
a sort of everyday fact of german

281
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,040
politics

282
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,600
but no one wants to step into merkel's

283
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,000
shoes no one wants to play that role and

284
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
that's for two reasons one because

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
there's a realization that actually you

286
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,079
know you can't do anything without

287
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,560
germany in europe you need germany to be

288
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,399
able to move forward and secondly

289
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,320
because actually it's not just about

290
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
germany it's about all member states and

291
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
increasingly the european parliament and

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,519
the european commission agreeing and

293
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,240
that's a lot of people to please

294
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,440
um

295
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,519
on your question about what can we

296
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,279
expect from germany

297
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,519
i mean

298
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,839
i i suspect that in the first couple of

299
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,839
months whoever is chancellor there's

300
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
going to be a solidification of merkel's

301
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,360
legacy

302
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,480
but the question is what comes next and

303
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,959
does that come before the french

304
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,920
presidential election or after

305
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
because again

306
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
although it's not just up to germany and

307
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,560
france uh to determine what happens in

308
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,680
the eu those countries do matter and

309
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
when i talk to people be that in

310
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,279
brussels or in paris or in other eu

311
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,200
capitals there's the sense of are we

312
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
going to see a more assertive germany on

313
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
defence in foreign policy are we going

314
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,519
to see a green you know it's not just

315
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,880
about the chancellor actually it's about

316
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,560
who's going to be foreign minister who's

317
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,399
going to be finance minister i mean to

318
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,040
pick up where ali left off um

319
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,200
in paris people like oh if we have a

320
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,680
green foreign minister will we see a

321
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,480
different position on china will we see

322
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,639
a rejection of north stream two

323
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,800
uh if we have a finance minister who's

324
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,639
the liberals are we going to see even

325
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,519
tougher on fiscal discipline precisely

326
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
at a point where perhaps paris and other

327
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920
capitals um in southern europe would

328
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
like to see a revision of certain of

329
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,560
those fiscal rules don't worry georgina

330
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,639
the greens won't let him

331
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,399
but it i mean i think there's a lot of

332
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,959
pragmatism in paris and in brussels and

333
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,240
there is a sense that you know what we

334
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
need we need to be patient we need to

335
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,480
let these coalition talks play out but

336
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
certainly i have and i don't know if

337
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,560
everyone else in this room agrees rarely

338
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,959
seen as many important pieces of

339
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,040
legislation being discussed at one time

340
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,600
in brussels and you those discussions

341
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,079
can go can go on merkel is going nowhere

342
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,000
until there's a new chancellor but to

343
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,839
move forward you really do need a german

344
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
government in place and so the question

345
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,680
is will that lead to a significant

346
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,839
change at the moment i think and i

347
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,480
suspect that most capitals think let's

348
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,880
not hope for change just yet and let's

349
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,639
just assume that there will be more of

350
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,240
the status quo

351
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
excellent yes if i may just jump in

352
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,399
georgina you said nobody really wants to

353
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,240
step into the shoes of chance america in

354
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,079
europe if i understood correctly it's my

355
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,920
understanding and please correct me if

356
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
i'm wrong that uh emanuel mccoy has been

357
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
drawing that exactly that even

358
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,000
throughout her reign i mean he was not

359
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,360
shy about

360
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
laying out his own vision for what

361
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,959
europe is supposed to be chance america

362
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,800
left him hanging that's a different

363
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
story altogether did not

364
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,200
chime in his grand vision for an

365
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
independent european strategic policy

366
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,399
strategic defense policy and all that

367
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,880
but i think emanuel khan was not shy has

368
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,959
not been shy is not shy

369
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,839
about

370
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,680
trying to be one of the leading if not

371
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,760
the leading voice in europe let me just

372
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
say one thing perhaps interesting to the

373
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,959
audience because we're right in the

374
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,720
midst of this conversation about foreign

375
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,959
policy and germany's role for those of

376
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,399
you who may not have been following the

377
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,360
uh debates as closely as we have

378
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,320
we had three main television debates

379
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,680
and

380
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,639
not a single i repeat not a single

381
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,279
foreign policy question was asked in

382
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,480
those three television debates all right

383
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,560
so that's just that's all you need to

384
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,279
know as non-germans about the priority

385
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,600
that our campaign and our politicians

386
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
placed on both foreign policy and europe

387
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
as i may say german leadership is

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
something i understand georgina and this

389
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,480
part of the world too that is very much

390
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,120
wanted you you quoted the former polish

391
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,560
foreign minister but i have two things

392
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,959
to say about this first of all uh what

393
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,600
if and when germany does exercise uh its

394
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
power and flex its muscles as it has

395
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,760
done during the financial crisis as it

396
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,839
has done during the migration crisis

397
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,839
it's always a bit of a twenty you know

398
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,000
catch 22 game isn't it

399
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you know we've been vastly criticized

400
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,079
for flexing our muscles for imposing

401
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,880
austerity uh budget measures we've been

402
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
severely criticized in this part of the

403
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
world by central and eastern europe for

404
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,360
now closing the borders and and letting

405
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
syrian refugees into our country so you

406
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,600
would argue it's it's a catch-22 the

407
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,800
other thing and last thing i'll say

408
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,720
about german leadership of course and

409
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,079
that has nothing to do with chance

410
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,360
america that has nothing to do with

411
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,560
chances or even chance helmut call it is

412
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,959
that german and the terms german and

413
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,680
leadership are just uh um is not

414
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
historically speaking has never been a

415
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,199
good match in the sense what i'm trying

416
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,399
to say is

417
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,880
we when you talk about germany history

418
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,760
is never far away you only you're you're

419
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,839
a native speaker you only need to

420
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,560
translate the the term leadership leader

421
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,600
into german to know um that that we as

422
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,040
germans are not very comfortable with it

423
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
the kerber foundation and the munich

424
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,920
security com uh uh conference had a

425
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
joint

426
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,320
john paul uh uh asking

427
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,880
do germans one more

428
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,800
should germany accept more leadership or

429
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,519
less that was the question to to to our

430
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
public well guess what georgina guess

431
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
what roland you know the outcome so the

432
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,079
the leadership role

433
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,240
i'm afraid that europe is expecting from

434
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,040
us uh is not going to be forthcoming uh

435
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
very soon we are one of many that's how

436
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,240
we see each other and a team player and

437
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
and to get past that to get beyond that

438
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,440
i think it takes a couple of more

439
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,680
generations indeed i think one of the

440
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,000
big problems or even elephants in the

441
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,240
room i could say is is the fact that

442
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,519
germans still want to be a big

443
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
switzerland

444
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,320
and you can prove this in opinion polls

445
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,759
and i also want to come back to your

446
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,240
first to first part of what you said in

447
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
you know asking for german leadership in

448
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,199
some cases is just asking germans to do

449
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,160
or to lead on the way that the the the

450
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,480
person who asks wants them to lead right

451
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,720
which is uh which is a dubious approach

452
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,519
to leadership but anyway we have one

453
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,880
question from the audience i'm sure

454
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,199
there are more so

455
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,720
marcin zabarovsky microphone over here

456
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,759
and andre is next

457
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,160
thank you we collect

458
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,279
sure uh it's it's well i pretty much

459
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,560
wanted to say the same thing which was

460
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,880
just being said because i attended in a

461
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,760
couple of events in warsaw and we heard

462
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
from

463
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
german diplomats that there is no

464
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,160
appetite for

465
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,799
leadership in foreign and defense policy

466
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,720
i understand that the three party

467
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,839
leaders they agree on qualified majority

468
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,959
voting

469
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,480
in in uh

470
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,280
in

471
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,799
cfsp and

472
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,959
uh

473
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,679
and defense eu defense policy so which

474
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
if it goes through that that would be

475
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
quite meaningful

476
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,919
but given that there is no appetite no

477
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,480
interest in it how attractive the post

478
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,520
of foreign minister actually even is

479
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
because i would imagine that the green

480
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,960
would actually prefer to be the climate

481
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,080
minister

482
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,360
and the fdp would rather prefer to be

483
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
refined as minister of economics

484
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,160
minister

485
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,240
and uh and they'll be pushing each other

486
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,200
to this post which has glorified title

487
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,919
but no influence not least also because

488
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,000
a lot of eu issues rest with the

489
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
councillor armed

490
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,559
thank you thanks very much andre you're

491
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,520
next right here in front of you

492
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
thank you andre matashek i'm journalist

493
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,160
here from slovakia david pravda

494
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,400
we have been talking about what's what

495
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,280
what

496
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,640
paris maybe

497
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,799
is expecting and the others so

498
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,360
now uh can you maybe

499
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,919
show tell us that what we should expect

500
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,160
in our region because it's a

501
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,919
transfer marker was all the time

502
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,919
perceived as somebody who

503
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,160
somehow understands the region uh

504
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,400
central europe i would sometimes say

505
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,480
that maybe too much uh he showed too

506
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
much understanding for people like like

507
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,520
prime minister orban uh but

508
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,080
general feeling was she understood the

509
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
region quite well and

510
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,039
with a

511
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,000
new

512
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,640
german chancellor or whoever it will be

513
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,320
it might be a different we feel that it

514
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
might be a different will it be

515
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,520
different do you think that it will be

516
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,720
different

517
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,200
this kind of host politic question will

518
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,120
be different thank you

519
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,559
all right and the third question goes to

520
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,760
you sir

521
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,000
is hello my name is marco rosso i work

522
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
for meridian infrastructure from paris

523
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
i'm half german half italian so maybe a

524
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,640
bit of context i work in paris and

525
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,600
travel

526
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,039
europe so

527
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,120
i had a question that i would like to

528
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,720
that the panelists to answer your

529
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,440
introduction was more like schaffenville

530
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,200
there is a fear

531
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,960
is it real i think this is something

532
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,799
that outside of germany

533
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,039
is not seen so much as it is usually in

534
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,960
german to see oh this is a great change

535
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,360
a big catastrophe is coming how can we

536
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,200
how can we do this i think after 16

537
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
years of government in any other place

538
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,600
in the world in a democracy you would be

539
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,360
looking forward for the new things that

540
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,440
are coming and i feel that in germany at

541
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,000
least it is uh

542
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,080
very much more on the fear side oh can

543
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
we can we make this

544
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
all right i would i would like to with

545
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,919
so so we have the foreign ministry

546
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,679
question the question of what to expect

547
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,559
in central europe and aren't germans too

548
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,360
apprehensive about themselves and please

549
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,200
take your pick don't answer all three

550
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,840
but i think the first one goes to you

551
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,120
definitely the first one if you allow

552
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,280
also the uh the third one of course the

553
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,640
first one you're absolutely right the

554
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,640
foreign policy uh post is probably not

555
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,480
the highest price you have in coalition

556
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,559
talks in germany maybe different in

557
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,200
other parts of europe uh mainly for one

558
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,960
because for 16 years we've had a pretty

559
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,400
efficient foreign minister and her name

560
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,200
was angela merkel and and you know

561
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,760
anyone who was at veda chamacht anyone

562
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,600
who was at the foreign policy pretty

563
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,960
much

564
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,320
had to had to sort of assert him himself

565
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,159
in that role and make that voice assert

566
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,400
we've had allow me that assertion

567
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,880
by all accounts as somewhat weak foreign

568
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,440
foreign minister for the past four years

569
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,240
which uh we need we need a change in

570
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,840
that part of the ministry but you're

571
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,559
absolutely right uh uh for foreign

572
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,039
policy is for the foreign minister was

573
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,840
usually a post which politicians wanted

574
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
because it had the highest approval

575
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,679
ratings because what you did you walked

576
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,520
around the world you you cut ribbons and

577
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
you shook hands and as a german you

578
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,360
never had to take any tough decisions or

579
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,840
declare war or rescind war or or

580
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,640
threaten people and therefore uh it was

581
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,240
certainly an attractive post for those

582
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,440
who want a popularity um but but right

583
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,720
now georgina already alluded to it the

584
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,120
the greens the greens might might get

585
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,600
first step at this annalina berber or

586
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,440
that habeck might be one of them we'll

587
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,280
see let me just one

588
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,919
very very short remarks about the way

589
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,600
the germans perceive themselves because

590
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,720
i think that's

591
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
indeed look you know as being half

592
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
german

593
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,320
that germans are extremely fond and

594
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,840
protective of status quo okay i've said

595
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,240
it this morning to my talk to the young

596
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
leaders as well if you run for president

597
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,559
in the united states what is the number

598
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,200
one term the number one word you have to

599
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,320
immediately utter change what is the one

600
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,480
term that gets you to lose elections in

601
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,400
germany change

602
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,960
okay so that is why you're not having

603
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,880
any grand visions by any of the

604
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,039
candidates chance america understood

605
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,720
understood that soul of the german

606
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,440
public very well so yes you are right of

607
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,440
course nobody in germany is looking for

608
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,360
drastic change if anything the attitude

609
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,559
is can we hold it together can we stay

610
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,400
at the level that we are at being

611
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,960
mindful that we have a russia that is

612
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,720
pretty assertive and aggressive towards

613
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,480
the central eastern european neighbors

614
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,240
we have a transatlantic partner in the

615
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,480
us that is no longer as reliable it used

616
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,280
to be and we of course we have a more

617
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,159
more and more confidence uh china which

618
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,080
we as germans are beholden to for

619
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,559
economic reasons uh from hungary and

620
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,159
poland we haven't even in that

621
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,640
particular discuss about so think of it

622
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
as we have our roof under a head the

623
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
world around us is tumbling but we're

624
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,720
saying please dear god let nothing

625
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,600
change

626
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,480
quite unrealistic georgina one minute

627
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,720
maximum

628
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,480
well i'm sure yeah i mean i'm i'm

629
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
probably not best placed to comment on

630
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
what the potential chance to learn how

631
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,120
you know how he sees such a but dude

632
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,480
from paris uh there is i think um a

633
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,159
recognition that perhaps some of the

634
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,039
handling say for example you know

635
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:17,520
announcing a summit with putin between

636
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,360
france at a bilateral level and then

637
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,720
going to the european council and then

638
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,960
going to see uh central houston european

639
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,880
states probably was not the right way to

640
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,320
do things and so there's a recognition

641
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,120
that actually um germany because of its

642
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,280
experience because of its history um

643
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,679
really matters in that conversation and

644
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,120
that's i really wanted to come back to

645
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,720
you on ellie because i completely

646
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,440
disagree on my contract wanting to lead

647
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,840
europe and then you know before go

648
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,679
moving to paris i was like yeah you know

649
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,440
france really wants to lead that's not

650
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,840
true france wants uh

651
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,679
uh to be the one to have a vision for

652
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,840
europe france has the ideas

653
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,080
but macron doesn't think that he can

654
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,679
achieve all of this on his own or by

655
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,080
leading he knows that he needs germany

656
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,679
in fact he needs all eu member states he

657
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,400
cannot replace germany um and if you

658
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,919
look at everything that's been discussed

659
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,159
in the council say the digital services

660
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,559
act the climate pact the strategic

661
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,720
compass of this blueprint for european

662
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
foreign policy those are all driven by

663
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
france so actually france is very much

664
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,520
able to influence without leading and it

665
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,960
knows that if it wants to get anything

666
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,400
done it needs to work with other

667
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,840
countries so basically you're saying

668
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,039
they have a vision but they want

669
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,120
everyone else to pick up the tab well

670
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,559
they want to with everyone else to

671
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,400
deliver on it there you go i would never

672
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
say that

673
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,840
elmer brock last question goes to you

674
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,799
microphone right here in the middle

675
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,200
or to your left

676
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,559
thank you very much

677
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,720
first of all one

678
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
of the important outcomes of this

679
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,159
election is that all four parties

680
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,720
competing for that or that coalition are

681
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,919
pro-european parties and all the leaders

682
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,679
compared to other countries is a real

683
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,240
luxury problem germany has in this case

684
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,200
and that means it meets stability

685
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,279
for european cause but with

686
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,520
differentiations

687
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,919
secondly

688
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,000
a german chancellor will play always an

689
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,919
important role because of the critical

690
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,000
mass of germany

691
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,840
and every chancellor has to grow in

692
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,400
these shoes

693
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,080
and therefore

694
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,520
it doesn't matter who will become

695
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,720
chancellor he will grow in such shoes

696
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,520
but i think it's really a lesson of

697
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,200
history germany has

698
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,279
therefore the germ chancellor will never

699
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,320
look

700
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,679
for

701
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,440
leadership

702
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,640
because as bismarck said germany is too

703
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,880
small for supremacy

704
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,080
and too big for balance

705
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,960
and

706
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
via europe with shared leadership

707
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,640
germany has come out of this role this

708
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,640
is comfortable for our neighbors and for

709
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,039
ourselves and no responsible german

710
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,559
chancellor will

711
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,559
go out of this situation

712
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,240
last point

713
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,240
i'm sure that the liberals will not take

714
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,919
the foreign ministry

715
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,600
because they went out of power

716
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,919
parliament after they took the foreign

717
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,640
ministry i'm absolutely sure

718
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,360
when i discussed it with mr lindner

719
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,720
two weeks ago

720
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
they will take the finance ministry

721
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,640
thank you so much

722
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,679
fantastic final words really doesn't

723
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,000
need it's not it's a non-sequitur time

724
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,320
is up i just want to say as a as a

725
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
takeaway for the whole debate give

726
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,279
schultz a chance uh and i'm saying this

727
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,760
as a member of the cdu party

728
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,919
so thank you so much for active

729

we'll now have please stay put we'll

732
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,919
have a

733
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,000
debate on fiscal monetary policy

734
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,919
alignment led by eleanor ragg and we

735
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,840
