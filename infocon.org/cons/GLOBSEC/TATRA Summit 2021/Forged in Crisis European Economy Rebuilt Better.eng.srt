summit i have to highlight this we all

23
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,120
may have used cars and planes to get

24
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,360
here but there was also this year a

25
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
special train provided by the ministry

26
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
of transport

27
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,639
where the green deal focus group took

28
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,199
place on the train so very apt to set

29
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
the tonality for the summit

30
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
you're also going to find a lot of young

31
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,599
faces at the tatra summit this year the

32
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,360
tatra summit young professionals have

33
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,440
been welcomed to encourage debate and

34
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
dialogue with senior leaders to get a

35
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,039
fresh perspective on the problems we're

36
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,719
dealing with so welcome them as well

37
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
we'll also have a whole lot of q a this

38
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
is an intimate summit we want to talk to

39
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,560
each other we want to spark some ideas

40
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,039
so make sure you participate in the

41
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,039
theme that we have for this year which

42
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,840
is forged in crisis the european economy

43
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
rebuilt better we can go on ad nauseum

44
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
about how europe seems to perform really

45
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
well after every single crisis but is

46
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
this the crisis that will really change

47
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,919
everything we'll find out at least what

48
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
you think through the sessions the

49
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,599
pandemic is of course the biggest crisis

50
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,000
we've faced since world war ii so if

51
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,240
europe is not forged now it never will

52
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,400
be so this year we will facilitate those

53
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,440
discussions and really focus on the

54
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,440
policy recommendations and the business

55
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
solutions we really need to make this

56
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,400
happen

57
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
the focus for the eu ministerial

58
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,199
meetings this time really did shift

59
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
though from post-pandemic recovery to an

60
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,720
energy crisis and that really dominated

61
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,199
the conversation on the agenda was also

62
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,039
the implementation of the recovery and

63
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,440
resilience facility but again where is

64
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
the focus for politicians at this point

65
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,960
that is a quick question and a question

66
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,639
that will really ground us in our

67
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,280
discussions around a deeper strategic

68
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,520
economic digital and green

69
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,319
transformation now the main program is

70
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,399
going to be held in this particular room

71
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
so keep coming back to it for all of the

72
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,479

when we need good news uh in this

128
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,279
environment uh

129
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,279
as much as we we we need first is that

130
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,519
the weather is great we arrange a

131
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,920
perfect weather this is probably the

132
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
last weekend of a great weather in

133
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,880
tatras from monday on it will be snowing

134
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
so we've made the globe section made

135
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,040
everything that you can have a beautiful

136
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
view outside it's colorful and to enjoy

137
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,640
a little bit of fresh air and number two

138
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,240
is that we reached

139
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,360
100 percent of vaccination

140
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,839
at least in this

141
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,320
room which i think is absolutely great

142
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
because that's why we can meet here if

143
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,959
it would be maybe a few weeks later

144
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,440
maybe it would be more difficult but

145
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,360
all those who have been vaccinated are

146
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,920
helping not only us but to economies

147
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
also to function

148
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,320
this year we are celebrating the 10

149
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
years uh anniversary of tatra summit and

150
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,839
when i look back 10 years ago it was

151
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,000
2011. we were sitting with ivan korchok

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
then the permanent representative

153
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
at in brussels in the eu in his garden

154
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,720
and we were brainstorming about the

155
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,440
responses to euro crisis

156
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
at that time we asked ourselves

157
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,959
questions will the euro currency survive

158
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,320
another year

159
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,639
what will happen to greece does center

160
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,120
europe know what it wants and how to fix

161
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
the euro crisis

162
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
and actually it was the crisis that the

163
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,040
slovak government

164
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,079
over the soviet government fell

165
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,000
and it was like chasing the train we

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
were constantly overtaking by events we

167
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,320
felt that the discussion in central

168
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,880
europe and in slovakia and in brussels

169
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
were like two absolutely separate

170
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,399
universes and there was an urgent need

171
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,000
to bring closer

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,760
the european debate and the debate in

173
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,040
slovakia

174
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,440
which was almost non-existent

175
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,920
so how to interconnect them and we were

176
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,000
convinced that if we want to influence

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,800
the european politics and vice versa

178
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,560
we need to be part of a broad upon

179
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,200
european debate so we created and

180
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,160
established this platform

181
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,959
within 10 years i think it emerged into

182
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,079
an intimate but still important forum

183
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,160
for political and business leaders to

184
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,839
discuss the political and economic

185
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,079
future of europe and during that time

186
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,399
during these 10 years tatra summit

187
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,440
hosted

188
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
hundreds of experts politicians european

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,680
officials and beyond

190
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,040
in this room

191
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,600
we have welcomed olaf schultz probably

192
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,560
the next chancellor of germany who was

193
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
sitting here a few years ago wolfgang

194
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,880
schwab donald tusk angel guria

195
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,320
cristalina

196
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,800
they all came here to discuss about the

197
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,880
future of europe and our economies to

198
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,800
our beautiful mountains

199
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,360
but it was not only about debates for

200
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
these 10 years for example there were

201
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,360
some memorandus signed between the

202
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
ministers of finance of ishigar iv and

203
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,560
france

204
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,800
or tatra summit also gave birth to the

205
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,720
slovak bacteria alliance so there are

206
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,880
very concrete outcomes

207
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,279
but actually when i look back at this 10

208
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,959
years

209
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
it is a decade of crisis and

210
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,920
firefighting when we look at uh europe

211
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,160
after the financial and economic crisis

212
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,800
migration crisis came after that brexit

213
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,519
after that pandemic so we are in

214
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,000
constant firefighting and events are

215
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
dictating us and we are just reacting

216
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,959
so the key

217
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,279
uh question today is

218
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
how could we go over this decade of

219
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
firefighting how could we

220
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,000
create a vision how could we use this

221
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,800
pandemic into an opportunity can we turn

222
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,639
it into an opportunity

223
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,760
for our

224
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,000
economies and that's why the claim of

225
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
this year's

226
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,880
forum is great

227
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,399
it's the i'm sorry

228
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,279
forging crisis european economies

229
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,839
rebuild better

230
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,680
there is a little anecdote that i want

231
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
to share with you that illustrates my

232
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,079
point an elderly man went to the train

233
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:43,440
station

234
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,839
wanted to book his tickets

235
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,000
and asked i liked i'd like to have a

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,399
return ticket please

237
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,480
and the clerk said where to

238
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,800
and he says back to here of course

239
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,040
but this illustrates that we will never

240
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,240
go back to the world before the pandemic

241
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,240
so what we need to do is we really need

242
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,279
to

243
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,720
use it

244
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,440
and create a good opportunity how to

245
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,639
reform our economies i really think this

246
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,360
is a momentum that we cannot lose

247
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,120
this task is not easy and it cannot be

248
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,240
sorted out only by governments

249
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,160
we need public private collaboration we

250
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
need a broader mobilization of our

251
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,079
public to make it happen

252
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,320
we need joint projects joint initiatives

253
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,920
joint financing

254
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
and i hope this platform can help

255
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
to mobilize that collaboration between

256
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,279
public private media and all the

257
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,399
stakeholders

258
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,079
and i see three

259
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,320
interconnected dimensions of reforms

260
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,880
first is the national level

261
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,040
i see here prime minister of slovakia

262
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,320
who has just announced the reform autumn

263
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,639
a few days ago

264
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,160
there are national recovery and

265
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,320
resilience plans as part of the broader

266
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,440
european strategy on national level

267
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,519
we are trying to make eu recovery fund

268
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,800
an impulse

269
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,959
for sustainable growth not only just a

270
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,399
simple recovery

271
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,199
second there is a regional dimension

272
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,440
because the investment gap is so big

273
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
that it cannot be filled only by

274
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,880
european money

275
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
we need to mobilize the private capital

276
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,959
but we can do it only on the regional

277
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,120
basis because our economies are too

278
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,680
small to mobilize private capital that's

279
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,480
why

280
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,440
we need and we came up with the idea of

281
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
starting the danube tech valley

282
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,279
initiative and we are

283
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,040
we hope we will be able to move it

284
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,519
further soon

285
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,240
shall we create regional capital markets

286
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,480
or how to attract and keep talents here

287
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,759
in this region these are the key

288
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,600
questions and the third is the global

289
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,560
element

290
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,399
and the global trends we need to watch

291
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,279
because they are defining uh they will

292
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,199
be defining our actions that's why i'm

293
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,839
glad that we have here in the room also

294
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,880
the secretary general of oecd mr corman

295
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
who joined us uh here in bratislava we

296
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,079
are very happy to have you

297
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,240
we can see that one of these effects the

298
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,839
global effects of the pandemic is

299
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,160
de-globalization slowly but surely the

300
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,799
multi-retinal system is unfortunately

301
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,240
breaking up

302
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,919
the logistic difficulties brought to

303
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,319
light by current crises are already

304
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,559
pointing to a shift away from global

305
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,520
just-in-time supply chains

306
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,599
just think of the complications that the

307
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,439
delays in the production

308
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,160
of cars because of the lack of the chips

309
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,039
created in europe

310
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,520
moreover as economic difficulties mount

311
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,480
the inevitable growth of nationalism and

312
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
my nation-first politics will push

313
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
companies also to localize business

314
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,760
operations

315
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
and favor national and regional supply

316
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
chains and thirdly

317
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,520
china's geopolitical rise has been more

318
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,080
than three decades in the making

319
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,679
china has successfully transformed

320
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,039
itself into an economic and

321
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,039
technological superpower by just few

322
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,120
expected such a confrontational

323
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,039
atmosphere that we are seeing

324
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,600
now finally the climate change policies

325
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,120
will forge economies to go local

326
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,799
there will be pressure to get rid of the

327
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,640
carbon footprint from production and

328
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,280
global supply chains

329
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,039
and this is a huge opportunity for us

330
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,840
and for center europe as well so

331
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,760
how this translates into the situation

332
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,280
in central europe if you want to know

333
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,200
more you can look up our strategic

334
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,280
transformation index that you will see

335
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
downstairs

336
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
so before i conclude my remarks i just

337
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,520
want to thank to all of our partners

338
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,280

we always love hearing from you robert

372

so not to worry at all before we get

373
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,280
started um raise your hands that this is

374
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,559
your first time at a tatra summit

375
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,880
ooh welcome newbies

376
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,640
raise your hands if you've done every

377
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,480
single one of them for the past 10 years

378
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,200
three

379
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
keep going to them to figure out how

380
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,640
much it's changed it's been a

381
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,480
magnificent change and now when people

382
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,799
ask me what i think of the tatra summit

383
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,120
i usually liken it to jackson hole in a

384
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
completely different environment so

385
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
there you go that's the setting that

386
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
we're going into the spirit that we're

387
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,440
going into our first conversation that

388
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
sets out our groundwork for the next two

389
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
days here uh in the mountains we're

390
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,960
talking about being forged in crisis

391
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,280
europe rebuilt better so could i invite

392
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,039
to our little stage prime minister of

393
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,280

and paul pasquale executive director

reefs and bank international

402
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,520
[Applause]

403
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
gentlemen last year we talked about a

404
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
recovery fund we have it now it's big on

405
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,720
the face of it but the question we're

406
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,960
faced with is how do we use all this

407
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,840
fire fire power sensibly and in a way

408
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,240
that it actually has impact and puts the

409
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,159
health of our planet and our people at

410
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,400
its very center how do we balance

411
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,919
recovery and resilience in the new

412
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:19,679
normal are we still hankering for the

413
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,000
old normal or are we

414
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
finally at a point where this is the

415
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
crisis that brings unity to europe or

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,960
not so let me

417
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,360
start with the audience first i'd love

418
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,799
for you to get involved if you have a

419
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,720
point to make a question to raise raise

420
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,640
your hand catch my eye i will keep

421
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,720
coming back to you but when you do speak

422
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,159
make it really really short we have lots

423
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,880
of time outside to speak um and also

424
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,120
give us your name your organization and

425
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,640
the country that you're from so we get a

426
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
perspective of where you're coming from

427
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
um and wait for the mic to get to you if

428
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,120
you possibly can

429
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,679
so the question here says is we seem to

430
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,120
be careening from one crisis to another

431
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,520
just as we start getting a grip on

432
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,840
how to recover from covid we are dealing

433
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,640
with an energy crisis we're heading into

434
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,880
a supply chain issue which is waiting

435
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
for us just a couple of months down if

436
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,559
it's not already here

437
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,200
um prices are going up inflation's going

438
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,080
up

439
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
firms are struggling across the board

440
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,559
not just here in europe and in central

441
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,720
europe but across the world

442
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,159
everything seems to be taking us by

443
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,440
surprise

444
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
surprise yet again so are we once again

445
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,320
headed for a trap where we're going to

446
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
try and address an immediate crisis and

447
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,679
somehow

448
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,840
lose our perspective and the longer term

449
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
vision that we have of building the

450
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,559
stronger europe with a green focus a

451
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,480
green recovery at its center i want to

452
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,880
start with you prime minister

453
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,280
no not at all we are definitely not in

454
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,799
trap yeah and uh

455
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,799
the reason why i say that and i was

456
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,640
thinking you know because i knew that

457
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,320
this question will come

458
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,720
and i think uh we're facing a lot of

459
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
challenges

460
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,919
and i say challenges not problems

461
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,080
because there are really challenges but

462
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,960
we are facing a great opportunity

463
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,840
and that's myself being a prime minister

464
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,120
in this turbulent time i always wait for

465
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,880
the day when there will be

466
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,280
better news than the news before

467
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
somehow i get the opposite and you

468
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,799
listed them you listed them and it's

469
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,880
growing we thought okay pandemi is the

470
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,840
crack is the crisis now we see the

471
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,200
economic

472
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,880
uh crisis that

473
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,799
related to it now we see the energy

474
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,400
crisis we're asking whether we're gonna

475
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,559
have enough energies etc and we wonder

476
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,039
what else could come but

477
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,360
being in the crisis over the last one

478
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,279
and a half year we see that it's

479
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,480
manageable

480
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,799
and the reason why i said it's a great

481
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,559
opportunity i see what's happening

482
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,039
within the europe if we go before the

483
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,200
crisis you could see that bureau was

484
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,679
speaking about integration institutional

485
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,919
integration we're looking for ways how

486
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,279
to make us more integral and and it

487
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,600
caused a lot of political

488
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,919
i would say discomfort some country said

489
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:05,039
yes

490
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,120
sanchez says no way

491
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,559
but then the crisis came somehow

492
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,240
everything went away and we were looking

493
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,640
for a solution to survive the crisis and

494
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,799
you could see a different and very

495
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,000
interesting

496
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,960
motion among the leaders uh one thing

497
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,880
yeah first it was maybe a little panic

498
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,679
because

499
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,679
kovit wasn't here or basically this kind

500
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,480
of epidemic wasn't here for 100 years so

501
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,320
nobody really had a clue how to deal

502
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,080
with it but

503
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,159
much more things on the european level

504
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,760
got faster

505
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,919
cooperation among the countries was i

506
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,440
would say

507
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,159
easier after the first turbulent times

508
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,000
where everybody was we have in slovakia

509
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,120
saying that the

510
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
the shirt is closer than the than the

511
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,600
code so yes some countries started to

512
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,039
look at themselves how to help

513
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,880
themselves and then the others

514
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,799
uh just like you know it's happening in

515
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,600
the airplane but uh the the thing is

516
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,840
that after that we were thinking okay we

517
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,919
need to help each other and this is the

518
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,640
great opportunity that any crisis that

519
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
will come and yes there will be some

520
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,240
crisis coming

521
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
i think the energy crisis will be a

522
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,200
rather shorter one

523
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,480
but we definitely know and i can share

524
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,919
that from the discussion that we have at

525
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,320
the leaders of the

526
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,039
european council that we all realize

527
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,000
we'll do better if we work together

528
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,720
and we had a western balkan summit

529
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,240
this this week

530
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,240
and i heard from the leaders they said

531
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
please if you come up with the solution

532
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,840
don't leave us out

533
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,400
so that's another important fact that

534
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
it's about cooperation and the

535
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,760
cooperation will be based on real needs

536
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,760
not on artificial ones not that we need

537
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,080
to be institutionally more integral

538
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,840
because it might look from a design

539
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
perspective better no it will be based

540
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,120
on a real needs and if we are willing to

541
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,679
help each other we'll be we will build a

542
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,080
stronger europe and europe must become

543
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,200
stronger it must become a leader within

544
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,880
the within the

545
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,919
world

546
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,440
so that's why i think it's a great

547
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
opportunity mr coleman do you agree with

548
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,520
that do you believe that europe has the

549
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,039
ability to

550
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,760
look beyond a crisis to crisis which it

551
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
has been known for uh your predecessor

552
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,679
had a famous saying

553
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:16,960
that europe

554
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,880
takes a while to get to where it needs

555
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
to be but it gets there in the end are

556
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,200
we still on the journey on the road to

557
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,559
getting there

558
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,720
well firstly um

559
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,279
but this covert pandemic and the crisis

560
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,279
that we've gone through has shown

561
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,679
is what we can achieve and what we can

562
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,120
actually get on top of when we put our

563
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,600
mind to it i mean overwhelmingly um i

564
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,600
mean if you look at where we are now

565
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,279
compared to where we thought we would be

566
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,919
i mean we're in a very strong position i

567
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,480
mean when the covert pandemic first hit

568
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,720
and you know all of the expectations uh

569
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,559
you know were i mean look it's been a

570
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,080
terrible crisis but if you look at where

571
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
we now are i mean vaccines were

572
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,679
developed much more quickly than was

573
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
anticipated

574
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,440
i mean the economic recovery is underway

575
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,799
the economy

576
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:02,480
economic growth is picking up the

577
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,919
economic outlook is improving i mean

578
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,760
since the middle of 2020 we have

579
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,120
continuously

580
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,440
upgraded our growth projections moving

581
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,039
forward and the reason for that is

582
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,200
because governments across europe and

583
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
around the world have got on top of the

584
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,240
health situation relatively well and

585
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,720
relatively quickly they've put a lot of

586
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,159
policy support there's been a lot of

587
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,320
monetary and fiscal policy support which

588
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,480
has uh you know under which has

589
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,960
protected i guess um you know businesses

590
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,640
and households from the worst impacts of

591
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,840
the crisis and we're now in a good

592
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,159
position to build for a stronger a

593
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,080
better future and in terms of your

594
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,600
question on europe i mean i've got a

595
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,559
very

596
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,320
positive view about what europe has

597
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,760
achieved i mean if you look over the

598
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,600
last

599
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
five six seven decades i mean where

600
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,080
europe came from and where europe is

601
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,720
today i mean it's i mean i was i was

602
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,480
born in europe i grew up in europe and

603
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
then went to australia for 30 years and

604
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,039
and coming back to sort of see

605
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
the the strength and the the

606
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
like-mindedness in the broad and what

607
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,039
has been achieved in terms of economic

608
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,039
prosperity and political stability

609
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,919
across

610
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,159
the broad european continent i mean i

611
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,919
think i think it's fantastic now in

612
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,600
terms of where we go to from here i mean

613
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,600
of course there will be uh external

614
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,120
shocks there'll be crises and there'll

615
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,120
be challenges but if we put our mind to

616
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,279
it if we work together if we cooperate

617
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,960
we can get on top of them i mean that's

618
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,520
what the response to the pandemic has

619
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,760
shown and i mean you know what do we

620
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,600
need to do well we do need i mean we did

621
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,240
have

622
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,320
sluggish productivity growth before the

623
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
crisis how can we get on top of that we

624
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,159
did have the climate change challenge

625
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,520
before the crisis and this is a

626
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,279
generational challenge that we need to

627
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,960
get on top of and like

628
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,640
the virus emissions don't stop at

629
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,640
anyone's border and so we do have to

630
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,840
have

631
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,520
an ambitious and effective but also

632
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,919
globally coordinated approach to that

633
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,799
and one of the reasons why we went

634
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,399
through the pandemic

635
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,080
comparatively well

636
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,559
the health management response was

637
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,640
effective in the broad

638
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,320
vaccines

639
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,760
were available more quickly than we

640
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,760
thought monetary and fiscal policy

641
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,919
support went in very fast and very

642
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:07,600
effectively but also the digital

643
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,039
transformation

644
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
accelerated strongly in the quantity

645
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,120
pandemic helping

646
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
businesses and communities adjust

647
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,159
and there's lots of opportunity in the

648
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,679
digital and green

649
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,559
transformation to build a stronger

650
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,440
cleaner fairer economy of the future and

651
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,640
i mean i think that that's what we have

652
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,080
to put our mind to that's what we've got

653
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,159
to cooperate on and i think that there's

654
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,240
lots of positive opportunity and i

655
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,159
believe that the future is right as long

656
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,039
as we learn the right lessons out of the

657
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,039
pandemic which is that we've got to

658
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,960
cooperate and work together across

659
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,880
nations and across

660
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,080
continents

661
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
mr pasquale do you agree are you that

662
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
optimistic that we're going to stay on

663
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,080
track for this green recovery that we've

664
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,440
been promised

665
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
well thank you first

666
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,840
let me say thank you to to our host uh

667
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,520
prime minister it's it's my first time

668
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,760
here i'm very honored and it's

669
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,039
uh it's a beautiful place and exactly uh

670
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,000
the uh the spirit or the idea behind it

671
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,240
is is perfect too

672
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,120
which is also close to to our heart as a

673
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,039
skyfishing group because we act in the

674
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,799
region it's bringing brussels closer to

675
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,120
the region uh and also having this this

676
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:19,919
link

677
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,279
between

678
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,399
politics

679
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,320
economies and and of course the

680
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,399
financial sector

681
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,559
i'm um

682
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,960
honestly i'm quite impressed that this

683
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,000
time

684
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,760
it it happened

685
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,840
the reactions in brussels were very fast

686
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,200
and

687
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,080
as it's been said also central banks

688
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,120
reacted in the right way very fast much

689
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,799
faster than before

690
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,520
the banks also acted i think the right

691
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,480
we entered it uh the crisis in a much

692
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,840
sounder position than the last time

693
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,880
and um i think what is what is crucial

694
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,440
that uh there is uh as the prime

695
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,519
minister said there is a vision

696
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,159
that unites us in europe of course the

697
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,919
devil is in the detail at the end of the

698
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,960
day but uh there is a vision uh we have

699
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,159
a next generation eu program that

700
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,440
sets the right priorities and i think

701
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
next generation will be not pushing

702
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,760
problems to the next generation but

703
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
providing them with opportunities and

704
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,640
this is if we get it right it's uh also

705
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,720
in particular true for central and

706
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,159
eastern europe there are huge

707
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,640
opportunities out there and we are very

708
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,159
positive and

709
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,799
open to contribute mr rash

710
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,240
positive as positive

711
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,640
yes and no i'm very much optimistic and

712
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,080
very much positive

713
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,679
about where we are right now the

714
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:47,600
momentum we which we got

715
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,919
and um which i believe would not have

716
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,200
been possible

717
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,679
prior to uh covet 19 the healthcare

718
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,279
crisis which we have for the paname

719
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,320
which we went through uh a year ago has

720
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,399
mobilized i would say many positive

721
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,840
aspects of of our society

722
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,480
if i remember what happened 18 months

723
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,760
ago in slovakia where

724
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,559
we started to talk to have dialogues

725
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,279
among cross sectors among policymakers

726
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,880
private sector which have not been

727
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,760
possible before in a very open and in a

728
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
very positive and constructive way

729
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
that's also why i believe that it was

730
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,480
managed so good and this secrets um i

731
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,960
would say a general shift of what are

732
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,799
the values in the society in the

733
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,320
community cooperation as was mentioned

734
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,720
by by the prime minister so from this

735
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
perspective point of view i'm optimistic

736
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
i'm also optimistic of what we are

737
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,720
facing right now

738
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,760
um which is obviously uh some

739
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,080
hiccups or some further evolutions and

740
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,679
i'm very much optimistic what we will

741
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,120
achieve

742
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,600
in the next generation program on the eu

743
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,760
level there's a huge topic it's not only

744
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,760
green it's not only about energy there's

745
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,399
a lot about social aspects as well in

746
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,320
quality inclusion and these aspects

747
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,760
which need to be touched and which i

748
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,080
believe are very very much important so

749
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,120
i believe

750
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
there is a good momentum there's good

751
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,080
positive energy a lot of people want to

752
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,480
contribute and we want to drive

753
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,200
the trap i see is in the execution

754
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,120
because you can have very good ideas and

755
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,919
we have a lot of very good ideas but

756
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,799
if you look what the next generation

757
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,159
foresees by 2030 or by 2050 europe wants

758
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,480
to be neutral climate or emission

759
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,519
neutral uh 2030 we want to reduce by

760
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,360
minus 55

761
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,519
i think the implementation will be the

762
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,679
biggest challenge so that we will have

763
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,240
initiatives which will

764
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,279
assure us that we will be there

765
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,200
in six years or seven years or eight

766
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,120
years where we want to be and there we

767
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,880
need to be very careful not to fall in

768
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,440
the trap of a short-term view

769
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,399
which

770
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,000
currently everybody is talking about

771
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,760
energy prices you know where it is it

772
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,559
was couple of days 160 now is 120

773
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,720
something uh this day when this morning

774
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,240
when i followed we need to be very

775
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,320
careful that we don't lose this

776
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,440
long-term view so and that's the a big

777
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,040
challenge ahead of us and

778
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,719
cross-functional it's not only policy

779
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,040
makers private sector everybody of the

780
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,079
community

781
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,599
how do we do that prime minister how do

782
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,359
you balance the politics of it for short

783
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,679
term when you're being told by companies

784
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,399
that they need your help bail us out

785
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:25,280
otherwise you're going to lose

786
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,520
productivity you're going to lose jobs

787
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,359
that's a bit of a

788
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,599
scary threat to be making and then

789
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,199
you're looking at your long-term vision

790
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,918
where you want this to be a sustainable

791
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:37,599
green recovery how do you balance the

792
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:39,520
politics i'm not sure about the word

793
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,520
bail us out or bail them out i don't

794
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,199
think that's the right term and that's

795
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,320
not the right solution but help i fully

796
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,599
agree help cooperation uh well

797
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,918
as you heard i think we see an

798
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,760
opportunity but what's the difference

799
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,480
between opportunity and a success

800
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,000
hard work

801
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,320
if we want to have success and we must

802
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,200
have success we'll have to sweat

803
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,760
and we will switch we must sweat so what

804
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,680
i mean by that professionality

805
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,079
cooperation and the execution because

806
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,839
yes now we have all the plans the plans

807
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,119
are written well

808
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,440
we have experience of not having good

809
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,400
execution

810
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
here in slovakia it's difficult

811
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,760
because sweat requires or hard work

812
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,359
requires sweat and not everybody wants

813
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,200
to sweat but if we want to succeed we

814
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,960
must sweat we must cooperate so

815
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,680
definitely the dialogue and i'm glad and

816
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,079
i remember the time when i got into the

817
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,040
uh position of minister finance and the

818
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,119
crisis occurred and we had a very

819
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,119
constructive discussion with the banking

820
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,599
sector with the other sectors companies

821
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,440
because we had to find a solution

822
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,400
together

823
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,160
because if you want to finance you need

824
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,000
to help uh have the help of the banks

825
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,359
banking sector

826
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,280
not just the central bank of europe but

827
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,599
also the banks here with the the central

828
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,320
bank of slovakia and i remember uh

829
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,400
governor how he was helpful so so it

830
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,960
worked well we have the experience of a

831
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,560
good cooperation

832
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,680
good we need to grow uh higher and and

833
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,480
that's the way to go and also inspire

834
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,119
each other i saw it last year that we

835
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,720
were looking country to country what

836
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,079
they did okay that that's a good

837
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,680
solution let's imply

838
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,000
kutz arbeit was something that some

839
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,320
countries knew and others didn't really

840
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,640
reflect we saw that that was the pill

841
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,960
that was the medicine for sustaining the

842
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,359
labor in their jobs helping the

843
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,680
companies to get

844
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,000
get by it was costly

845
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,400
very costly but worthy because the

846
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,880
social aspect of the of the citizens

847
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,000
were kept

848
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,040
in like security so that was important

849
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,079
and now we're facing the energies yes

850
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:46,560
we will have to be very effective on on

851
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,040
not overspending and i think when we

852
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,880
speak about the the green economy when

853
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,200
we speak about the energy for from

854
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,760
short and midterm we have to start to

855
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,599
speak how we're going to make the rest

856
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,280
of the world greener

857
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,599
because yes europe will become greener

858
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,680
we will be the greatest of the of the

859
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,240
whole world but i'm asking is this

860
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,359
enough

861
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,119
are we going to pay the whole bill

862
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,960
because i think it's need to be

863
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
worldwide if we want to save this uh

864
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
this planet

865
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,720
mr carmen that's an interesting point

866
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,680
right

867
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,880
when you

868
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,240
speak as

869
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,720
as the secretary general of the oecd to

870
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,000
your members

871
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,079
what is the advice you give them because

872
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,160
uh prime minister hagar is not alone in

873
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:31,279
the quandary he faces

874
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,960
well i mean

875
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,320
the prime minister's right i mean when

876
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
it comes to climate change the only way

877
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,200
we're going to solve it

878
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,520
is through an appropriately globally

879
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,200
comprehensive approach a globally

880
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,960
coordinated approach but europe is

881
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,440
providing leadership and i'm

882
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,960
you know very confident that europe will

883
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
continue

884
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,359
to provide leadership but we need to

885
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,520
have a vehicle for multilateral

886
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,440
cooperation that finds the right

887
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,640
solutions

888
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,320
internationally and i mean we've we've

889
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,160
had one recent example of great success

890
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,000
when it comes to multilateral

891
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,839
coordination that is reform of our

892
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:04,960
international

893
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,720
tax arrangements in the context of

894
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,119
digitalization and globalization in fact

895
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,280
the inclusive framework with bringing

896
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,599
together about 140 countries around the

897
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,280
world is meeting right now to try and

898
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,000
put the final touches on that deal and

899
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,160
that'll make our international tax

900
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,320
arrangements fairer and work better in

901
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,640
the context of digitalization

902
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,400
globalization now i believe and i've

903
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,040
said this publicly we need something

904
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,280
similar when it comes to the climate we

905
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,400
need something similar when it comes to

906
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,079
carbon pricing arrangements around the

907
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,760
world you know in the end what is the

908
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,200
challenge i mean we want to be able to

909
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,000
lift the level of ambition and effort

910
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,240
in a way that doesn't create

911
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,480
unfair uh tried distortions and

912
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,320
counterproductive environmental outcomes

913
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,040
i mean you want to be able uh to lift

914
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,800
your level of ambition on climate in a

915
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,880
way that helps to reduce

916
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,560
emissions globally rather than to just

917
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
shift them into other parts of the world

918
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,640
and that doesn't have negative

919
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,520
competitiveness and and i guess tried

920
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,760
implications so how do we best do this

921
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,599
at a time when all around the world

922
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,040
while there is you know an increasing

923
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,320
number of countries that commits

924
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,880
themselves to global net zero

925
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,560
there are different circumstances

926
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,160
different starting positions and

927
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,760
different policy mixes that are used in

928
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,359
different parts of the world how do you

929
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,440
bring all of that together into

930
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,000
one coordinated approach that is

931
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,880
effective and fair effective as i say

932
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,480
because it helps reduce global emissions

933
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
and doesn't just shift them and fair

934
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
because every country and every part of

935
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,359
the world

936
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,320
carries a fair and proportionate

937
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,040
part of the burden and and that is you

938
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,760
know where i think the oecd and others

939
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,680
can hopefully apply

940
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,160
a positive and constructive role in

941
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,760
you know bringing the european

942
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,200
perspectives and perspectives in other

943
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,079
parts of the world onto one page to make

944
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,800
sure we can get to global net zero in a

945
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,720
way that is effective and fair all

946
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
around if you if you don't mind me

947
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,079
following that up with a with a question

948
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
you've been in this position of having

949
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,079
to balance the politics just like mr

950
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,079
hager um

951
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,400
how do you bring that experience on

952
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,560
being on the other side of the debate if

953
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,040
i can put that put it that way to

954
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,839
feeding in your strategy now of heading

955
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,800
to net zero despite all of the pressures

956
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,760
that you get from trade unions from your

957
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,680
industries that dominate within your

958
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,079
countries that experience how do you

959
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,359
draw from that in your ambitions as the

960
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,520
boss of the oecd at this point

961
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,359
well i mean balancing the politics is

962
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,680
essentially making sure

963
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,000
that you know you're very clear in

964
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
explaining what the problem is you're

965
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,560
very clear in how you're

966
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,240
seeking to address it

967
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,800
and you know you you make the case and

968
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,720
you know that is in the end the

969
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,040
political dynamics

970
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,960
in relation to an issue like climate

971
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,480
change will be different

972
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,520
in different parts of the world

973
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,440
depending i guess on the

974
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,040
starting position circumstances and

975
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,359
broader economic and political context

976
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,960
but but in the end

977
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,400
you know if we have a mission that we

978
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,640
agree that we all agree on uh if there

979
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,960
is a pathway and it's not just about

980
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,800
tomorrow it's about the transition

981
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,079
pathway over over a period then i mean

982
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,079
in the end you gotta you gotta explain

983
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,040
what it is

984
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
that you're doing and and why and you

985
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,160
gotta try and take people with you i

986
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,359
mean in the end

987
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,760
to have certainty around policy settings

988
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,440
over the medium to long term

989
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,040
you're only going to achieve that if

990
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,440
you've got a broad public consensus

991
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,400
backing you up and the only way you

992
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,319
get up end up with broad public

993
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,960
consensus is by continuing to engage in

994
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
the conversation and explaining what it

995
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,480
is that you're doing and why

996
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,800
so that brings up a point mr that that

997
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
that mr gorman's brought up bring

998
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,240
everybody along how are you within the

999
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,040
banking sector talking to your customers

1000
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,160
about what is sustainable what is green

1001
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,400
how do you differentiate between it when

1002
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
the lines haven't really been clearly

1003
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,920
drawn yet on

1004
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,400
a policy level at this point it's very

1005
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,000
difficult actually it's very very

1006
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,040
difficult

1007
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,119
just to make an example there's so much

1008
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:07,040
work going on on the taxonomy we're

1009
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,800
working on european level we're working

1010
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,520
on national level for instance from from

1011
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,839
banking perspective point of view we

1012
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,000
don't know yet what we should report in

1013
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,839
february we have a deadline in february

1014
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,079
we should report something

1015
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,000
defining our assets

1016
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,760
according to green not green and so on

1017
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,760
so there's a lot of things to be done in

1018
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,160
order to create a common understanding

1019
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,599
so that

1020
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,839
every stakeholder each stakeholder

1021
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,839
around the table understands what we are

1022
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:36,240
talking about okay and there's still a

1023
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,960
lot of work to be done and i think we

1024
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,480
need to do it in a pragmatic way

1025
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,960
otherwise we risk green washing and all

1026
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,800
this type of kind of topic which we

1027
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,119
don't want because we want to achieve

1028
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,599
minus 55 percent in a certain time

1029
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,319
horizon we want to be neutral in 2050

1030
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,280
and we need to be very transparent so

1031
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,760
when we are facing our customers it can

1032
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,200
be family households or

1033
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,200
corporates business partners

1034
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,599
policymakers there are many many many

1035
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,440
what i believe

1036
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,160
it is very much important that we create

1037
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,640
certain standards and that we create

1038
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,760
certain blueprints which will help us to

1039
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,520
bring this i will make an example this

1040
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,359
morning we had a very good discussion on

1041
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,920
the train uh from bratislava here we had

1042
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,040
the

1043
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,119
the the building the green building uh

1044
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,079
topic how to make that sustainable and

1045
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,000
we are missing these blueprints how does

1046
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,359
an end customer if i talk to a

1047
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,480
family

1048
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,040
how do they know that this is the right

1049
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,920
way to upgrade their house or to build a

1050
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,160
new house with this technology and i

1051
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,720
believe we need to deliver

1052
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,680
a certain confidence and

1053
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,160
like a consumer protection versus these

1054
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,960
end users in terms of standards so i'm a

1055
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,800
very big fan of

1056
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,880
handbooks and blueprints because this

1057
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,280
will ensure that whatever we define will

1058
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,160
bring also the level we made the topic

1059
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
today about the housing

1060
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,920
talking with afri tax we have two

1061
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,079
million houses or houses units in

1062
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,800
slovakia for instance most of them need

1063
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,680
to be renovated reviewed and redone and

1064
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,640
so on most of them have shablons they

1065
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,119
are similar constructed similar done and

1066
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,200
so on so there's easy to identify three

1067
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,359
four blueprints work together with

1068
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:25,760
business partners which will deliver the

1069
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,359
technology in order to um and how can i

1070
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:31,280
say upgrade the house so that we achieve

1071
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,040
that and this is the second point the

1072
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,200
discussion with the business partners

1073
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,760
we've done we as bank we are just an

1074
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,960
intermediate we don't have to

1075
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,480
we don't have the technology we don't

1076
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,480
have the end solution and this is

1077
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,160
another thing which i appreciate very

1078
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,040
much in this kind of platforms and which

1079
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,480
i very much support and i like very much

1080
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,079
is to have this brainstorming with other

1081
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,920
partners business partners they're

1082
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,079
coming from energy how to reduce energy

1083
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:02,560
drug we're talking about mobility how to

1084
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,280
make

1085
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,760
mobility in towns different mayors of

1086
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,280
the single towns these are all

1087
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,720
stakeholders which we need to bring

1088
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,359
together to discuss and see what we can

1089
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:13,280
that's the second momentum which i

1090
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,760
believe very much and at the end it was

1091
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,000
not yet said

1092
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,839
what we want to achieve in 2030 uh goes

1093
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:24,160
in terms of reduction of carbonization

1094
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,800
the

1095
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,119
decarbonization requires much more

1096
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,079
resources than is currently on the plate

1097
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,400
on a european level it is said that it

1098
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,200
needs additional 200 billion a year

1099
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,920
if i'm not wrong in slovakia in order to

1100
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,440
achieve the target

1101
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,560
uh until 2030 we need to chip in 20

1102
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,839
billion

1103
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,319
in order to get this money mobilized

1104
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,720
investors it was said by robert in

1105
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
in the opening speech we need to make

1106
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,319
sure that the solutions which we are

1107
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,160
going to find will create the value

1108
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,640
because this money needs to be somehow

1109
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,880
flow it needs to be repaid back it needs

1110
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,280
to create value it's not a male donation

1111
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,280
perspective point of view and so it will

1112
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,760
become very much important to understand

1113
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,920
what are their sustainable financial

1114
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,839
financing tool for

1115
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,760
achieving what we want to achieve we

1116
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,000
have a question in the audience uh if we

1117
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,040
can just pass the mic

1118
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,160
thank you very much

1119
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,839
uh my name is vasil

1120
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,920
one of those who actually came to each

1121
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,480
of the ten tatra summits i'm very proud

1122
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,400
of it i'm actually one of the founders

1123
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,280
so maybe that's that's that's the pride

1124
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,560
coming from as a child

1125
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,040
but i i share the optimism of the of the

1126
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
of the panel and i'm very happy we have

1127
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,440
optimistic leaders

1128
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,480
but

1129
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,960
i think the situation is not as rosy

1130
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,520
probably and when you look at europe

1131
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,359
there are probably kind of there is a

1132
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:50,480
tradition of going from crisis to chaos

1133
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,960
into sub-optimal solutions

1134
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,720
and i had the opportunity to spend some

1135
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,079
time in european politics and

1136
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,839
unfortunately this is

1137
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,319
what happens so

1138
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,599
if you look at

1139
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,599
realities i think just one of them which

1140
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,920
is capital markets union how long have

1141
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,280
we been talking about capital markets

1142
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,960
union and we all know that this is

1143
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,280
necessary for europe to be competitive

1144
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,280
uh not to have situations when

1145
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,680
most innovative companies from europe

1146
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,240
are leaving to united states israel

1147
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,599
china wherever

1148
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,160
and and not much happening so

1149
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,240
my point is yes we are moving forward

1150
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,640
kind of muddling through but uh the the

1151
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,800
world around is uh moving in the

1152
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,880
lightning speed so i basically want to

1153
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,240
ask uh

1154
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,480
what do you think why should europe be

1155
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,920
different

1156
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,440
when looking to the future what what is

1157
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,720
going to be different what has to be

1158
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,119
different for europe to be really

1159
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,440
optimistic and to be much quicker with

1160
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,000
the changes that we need

1161
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,160
uh who wants to take that one uh prime

1162
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
minister i can start because we have

1163
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,640
just the discussion uh on the european

1164
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,680
level

1165
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,040
about the global role of europe uh in

1166
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,400
the in the world

1167
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,599
so

1168
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,880
and when you said rosie rosie

1169
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,079
time right now definitely not yeah well

1170
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:08,240
when we're optimistic it doesn't mean

1171
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,000
that uh we we don't see the problems and

1172
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,280
we just want to look at them as a

1173
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,720
challenges so so definitely there is uh

1174
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,400
plenty problems every day we wake up

1175
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,880
into so so uh i'm seeing that but when

1176
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,280
we see of the vision or or the vision of

1177
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,359
the europe i don't think that it's been

1178
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,520
defined yet

1179
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,359
some people have or there are different

1180
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,119
views on

1181
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,640
what europe should be

1182
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,640
and i think this crisis is going to

1183
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,760
reveal

1184
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,200
the motives

1185
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,119
of the leaders in the europe it's

1186
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,280
already happening

1187
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,079
and and

1188
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,240
but what's important is that we all

1189
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,800
realize that if we want to succeed if

1190
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,760
europe wants to succeed

1191
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,280
and this is the i would say one of the

1192
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,119
last chances for europe to succeed

1193
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,800
otherwise just like you said the

1194
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,359
lighting speed of of the other big

1195
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:03,119
countries and continents here in the

1196
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,920
world will just take us over and europe

1197
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,760
will be this old continent so uh we need

1198
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,559
to

1199
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:12,960
cooperate and we need to define it very

1200
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,359
quickly and it's happening

1201
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,400
it's happening

1202
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,720
every month we speak about it on the on

1203
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,520
the

1204
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,960
on the summits

1205
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,119
so if it doesn't happen within half a

1206
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,559
year or so then we'll start losing

1207
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,240
and when when i look at it

1208
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,160
europe and that's that's said many times

1209
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,720
on the summits we have economically we

1210
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,079
are very strong

1211
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,400
uh also in the green we are very strong

1212
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,000
we're preparing instruments for the

1213
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,240
innovations uh et cetera so this is

1214
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,400
going to be our strength and we should

1215
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,520
keep that but we need to have a

1216
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,480
strategy a common or joint strategy

1217
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,680
of towards china toward russia toward

1218
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,880
united states and and not

1219
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,240
rely on maybe some old ties that were

1220
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,319
here because somehow they they're not

1221
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:05,440
there anymore i i might just pop in here

1222
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,280
too because i mean often in in these

1223
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,000
sorts of conversations i i find that

1224
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,640
europeans have a temptation to be quite

1225
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,480
hard on themselves i mean i i'm

1226
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,440
certainly much more positive about what

1227
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,440
europe has achieved and continues to

1228
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,920
achieve and the prospects for europe i

1229
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,680
mean of course you always got to look

1230
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,559
ahead

1231
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,960
you know at what else needs to be done

1232
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,280
and you know generally if a decision

1233
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,119
can't be made swiftly it's because

1234
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,960
there's not an established

1235
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,880
consensus across

1236
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,440
the necessarily you know in the broad

1237
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,200
community yet that can help carry that

1238
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,359
forward but i mean every now and then

1239
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:42,800
you also got to look back and and

1240
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,480
reflect on you know where you've come

1241
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,720
from and where you got to and i mean the

1242
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,480
quality of life the living standards i

1243
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,920
mean the quality of life across europe

1244
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,720
now compared to a couple of decades ago

1245
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,079
i mean in this part of the world in

1246
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,599
particular i mean it's it's

1247
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,559
extraordinary like how well europe has

1248
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,559
done and continues to do and you know

1249
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,960
europe has experienced decades and

1250
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,119
decades of peace stability and

1251
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:06,640
prosperity yes there have been

1252
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:07,920
challenges and there will be challenges

1253
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,680
in the future but the governance

1254
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,079
arrangements in europe actually

1255
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:12,880
do

1256
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,280
um you know have the capacity to work

1257
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,640
through it and you know what can be

1258
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,480
described as muddling through it's

1259
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,000
actually respecting each other's

1260
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,520
different perspectives and trying to

1261
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,920
find a way forward that is fair to

1262
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,079
everyone i mean be be careful what you

1263
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,839
wish for i mean you know that there are

1264
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,680
some systems of government that are very

1265
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,680
efficient but that doesn't mean that

1266
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,480
they're

1267
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,720
better i mean you know we are i mean

1268
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,400
across europe and across the western

1269
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,400
world i mean we believe in individual

1270
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,720
liberty we believe in uh freedom we

1271
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,800
believe in democracy we believe in

1272
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,720
you know the rule of law human rights

1273
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,280
and i mean okay that can be complicated

1274
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,440
can be

1275
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,960
you and i were talking as we were coming

1276
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,000
uh

1277
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,319
into the summit about this very same

1278
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,839
thing that we have great ideas we

1279
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:08,240
take our time getting to the decision

1280
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,880
but then we get trapped yet again with

1281
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,760
red tape bureaucracy and the loop goes

1282
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,640
round and round for the private sector

1283
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,599
so

1284
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,000
tell me putting basil's perspective

1285
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,680
question into perspective what do you

1286
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,359
really need at this point within uh rbi

1287
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,359
to make the decisions you need to make

1288
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,960
to make sure that you're heading to net

1289
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,119
zero like the bank wants to and the

1290
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,240
group wants to so thank you um i

1291
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,200
i think it's a very uh valid uh question

1292
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,440
and and there is definitely

1293
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,760
uh when you when you when you know uh

1294
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,160
how brussels works there is the risk uh

1295
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,960
that uh it gets a bit uh

1296
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,359
diluted or that there are many things

1297
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,040
packed into into new uh legislation so

1298
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,000
for us uh as

1299
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,960
banks or investors i think the first

1300
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,200
step and that has been taken very

1301
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,079
importantly that there is a target we

1302
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,160
know where we want to go

1303
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,160
um and the next thing is and

1304
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,040
unfortunately here um we had in the in

1305
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,440
the past we had some negative experience

1306
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,160
if we we know the target

1307
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,280
we have to define the way how to get

1308
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,640
there

1309
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,520
and um and once once it is it has been

1310
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,839
defined it should be also a step-by-step

1311
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:30,880
approach not making the second step uh

1312
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,559
before the first one

1313
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:33,520
um

1314
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,040
it has been mentioned the reporting

1315
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,370
requirements this would be like um

1316
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,559
[Music]

1317
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,520
a negative example for that so

1318
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,640
step by step uh be transparent and um

1319
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,319
and what we would need

1320
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,440
um

1321
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,280
very important

1322
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:52,000
if you are on the track stay on it

1323
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,720
so the the legal certainty uh don't

1324
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,520
change the rules uh every two years or

1325
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,359
too often yeah i mean a bit of

1326
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,280
recalibration is always

1327
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,599
needs to be there but

1328
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,079
that would be our number one priority

1329
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,119
please

1330
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,680
if we are on the track stay on there and

1331
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,200
don't change the rules don't change the

1332
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,800
rules is one question we have another

1333
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,720
question here in uh the audience if i

1334
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,359
can get a mic

1335
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,920
thank you very much simeon somokos from

1336

between christians and viking will

1341
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,440
will improve tremendously

1342
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,359
our contribution to the conferences the

1343
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,359
sunshine the good weather could you hold

1344
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:36,880
the mic up slightly as we can see the

1345
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,720
good

thank you very much for today and

1347
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,760

1349
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,440
fair enough uh

1350
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,799
mr prime minister the question is

1351
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,480
related with the western balkans and the

1352
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,319
summit last week in slovenia i

1353
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,760
understand there was a very good

1354
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,920
atmosphere everybody was very happy and

1355
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,960
optimistic

1356
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,079
the money that you are going to

1357
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,640
contribute 35 billion is something

1358
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,880
substantial but on the other hand

1359
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,119
you know many countries are trying many

1360
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,960
other powers and trying to penetrate you

1361
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,920
know the region turkey russia china et

1362
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,200
cetera

1363
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,119
how do you think we can have a follow-up

1364
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:13,760
on all those nice words we listened last

1365
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,960
time and we see actually the accession

1366
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,440
of the balkans somehow in the you know

1367
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,960
in the in the family of the european

1368
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,799
union thank you very much thank you raj

1369
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,160
for the question and i actually

1370
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,880
mentioned that on the on the forum uh

1371
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,599
i think europe's been considered strong

1372
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,520
because of the strong countries in the

1373
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,520
europe and uh

1374
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,079
we are used to

1375
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:37,359
negotiations that where they're

1376
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,400
bilateral i mean european countries with

1377
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,440
russia with china with united states or

1378
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,160
coalitions never together we don't have

1379
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,960
that

1380
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,799
and we don't think of that yet that's

1381
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:50,559
not the mental change yet so we have to

1382
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,079
have that mental change

1383
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,599
and uh

1384
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,599
i think we need to be very open to each

1385
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,720
other because formally yes club

1386
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:01,920
declaration very good but at the table

1387
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,319
we were quite often and we said okay but

1388
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,240
we heard this 2003. it's 2021 maybe one

1389
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,640
word changed enlargement that's all

1390
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,720
everything the all the words seem pretty

1391
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,319
much the same so what's going to happen

1392
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:16,799
everybody said okay enough of words

1393
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,599
action please action

1394
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,000
and usually they say that you need to

1395
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,960
say

1396
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,960
well something for nine months before

1397
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,559
the people start to do it

1398
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:28,640
on the european level it takes much more

1399
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:29,599
years

1400
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,839
so but definitely we have to have the

1401
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,280
push for action

1402
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,440
private sector understand that language

1403
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,280
because you cannot allow yourself to

1404
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,480
have words

1405
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,440
governments yeah they can get by 5 10 15

1406
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,920
years so so we need people in the

1407
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,440
governments who are

1408
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,760
people of action we need to be pushed

1409
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,760
into action and we need to be really

1410
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,920
blamed if there is no action

1411
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,359
how would you like to be pushed into

1412
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:55,760
action specifics that well i introduced

1413
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,359
it every day don't believe me if you

1414
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,040
said that the companies come they go

1415
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,040
bail us out no no guys let's have a fair

1416
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,960
talk so that's that's a push that's

1417
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,200
definitely a push but then we need to go

1418
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,760
into a fair discussion where we sit we

1419
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:10,799
pull our papers we pull our data and we

1420
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,040
go data based that's the importance

1421
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,960
because many times it's about okay let's

1422
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,240
have some promises let's have a

1423
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,359
declaration we all know declaration is

1424
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,760
good start if you have declaration every

1425
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,680
year you're doing something wrong

1426
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,160
one declaration is enough and let's go

1427
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,200
and let's put a strat strategy and then

1428
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,200
let's put a business plan

1429
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,319
together and then execute it that's it

1430
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,839
we have another question in the front

1431
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,799
thank you a pierre winch governor

1432
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,559
national bank of belgium

1433
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,040
um by the way secretary general i fully

1434
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,640
agree with you i think we should stop

1435
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,160
comparing europe with the united states

1436
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,960
of uh of america we don't have one

1437
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,880
unique democracy with one common

1438
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,960
language so it takes a bit more of time

1439
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
but indeed we

1440
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,960
we do better than modeling through

1441
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,319
i would like to come back to this issue

1442
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,240
of reporting and taxonomy because i'm

1443
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,839
i'm faced with a question i don't know

1444
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,520
if you've got an answer to it

1445
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,480
um

1446
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,960
it used to be that we had ets and ets as

1447
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,480
an economy it's very simple it's a

1448
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,640
peculiar tax it's a tax on

1449
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,720
a price on carbon

1450
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,599
and it's morally neutral so the aim is

1451
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,440
to be efficient so it might be that your

1452
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,079
company uh it's very expensive to reduce

1453
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,520
emissions so you're not going to do it

1454
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,880
and you're going to buy a permit to

1455
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,040
another one who's going to do double as

1456
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,040
much as you are going to do

1457
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,880
and the aim is to go for carbon

1458
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,400
neutrality

1459
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,640
as efficiently as possible

1460
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,960
and then we come with a taxonomy

1461
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,640
and then suddenly we've got good guys

1462
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,520
bad guys and or girls and in between or

1463
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,599
women and in between

1464
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,520
um

1465
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,160
how do we reconcile that

1466
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,359
i mean because suddenly you are

1467
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,200
compliant with cts

1468
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,119
and someone is telling you oh but you

1469
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,160
are bad in taxonomy what does it mean

1470
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,680
and i don't think we are having that

1471
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,319
debate so there is this kind of blurred

1472
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:01,839
picture where

1473
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,359
you might have companies to which you

1474
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,119
provide credit that are fully in

1475
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,880
compliance with ets by the way it's

1476
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,119
legal and it's an obligation and then

1477
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,359
suddenly there are bad guys or women or

1478
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,359
whatever what do you do what is the

1479
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:14,640
expectation

1480
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,319
uh and and i'm coming back to your

1481
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,400
comment which is we need an objective

1482
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,079
and a timetable and i have sometimes the

1483
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:21,839
impression that with the taxonomy and

1484
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,599
green fine suddenly it's

1485
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,640
you know 2050 is way too long 2030 is

1486
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,960
way too long it has to be today

1487
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,119
we need to stop financing the bad guys

1488
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:33,280
and i mean this hispanic football this

1489
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,200
is not going to work so i just wanted to

1490
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,880
have your opinion on that one i think

1491
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,119
let's start with mr corman's opinion on

1492
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:40,319
that um

1493
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:43,280
how it is it's a very very valid point

1494
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,480
it was actually going to be the next

1495
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,440
point that i made how do you define

1496
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,200
the good guys from the bad guys it

1497
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,839
depends on every economy and whichever

1498
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,319
sectors are strongest in every nation

1499
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:56,079
how do you do it well i mean i guess

1500
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,240
that this is the point that i was trying

1501
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,440
to make

1502
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,839
earlier and i mean you know in the end

1503
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:03,119
we do need

1504
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,960
a globally coordinated approach but we

1505
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:07,359
also need to bring more consistency into

1506
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,520
it but you got to do that in a political

1507
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,760
environment where you got to take

1508
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:14,079
populations with you and the political

1509
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,760
dynamic is going to be different from

1510
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,520
country to country depending on the

1511
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,839
economic structure in a particular part

1512
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,920
of the world and um you know we've got

1513
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
to try and find a way to bring all of

1514
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,599
that together now

1515
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,680
you know in some countries and you know

1516
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,119
it is true

1517
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,040
carbon pricing explicit carbon pricing

1518
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,440
is the most efficient way to go and if

1519
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,200
there was a globally

1520
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,280
consistent carbon price that would be

1521
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,960
the most efficient way to get to the

1522
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,440
objective that we want to get to over a

1523
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,520
set period and i mean that's

1524
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,720
been

1525
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,640
the right argument for a very long time

1526
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,559
the problem is if you

1527
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,160
pursue that

1528
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:50,880
in

1529
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,359
some parts of the world in isolation and

1530
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,040
in particular those parts of the world

1531
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,400
that are surrounded by low-cost

1532
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,680
manufacturing

1533
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,119
nations that are comparatively more

1534
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,119
polluting and you end up shifting

1535
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,839
economic activity jobs and emissions to

1536
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:05,200
your neighborhood where emissions are

1537
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,720
going to be higher

1538
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,160
than they otherwise would have been so

1539
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,839
you make the situation worse for the

1540
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:11,520
global environment as well as for your

1541
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,760
local economy that makes the politics

1542
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,839
more difficult so which then means that

1543
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,000
you know if carbon pricing

1544
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,760
isn't um

1545
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,520
implies all around the world in a way

1546
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,119
that is sufficiently comprehensive and

1547
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:25,440
consistent without carbon leakage and

1548
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,960
competitiveness implications then you

1549
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,200
have you end up with all sorts of other

1550
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,559
policy

1551
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,319
instruments and policy measures to

1552
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:35,359
complement in inadequate global

1553
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,880
carbon pricing ranges and that's where

1554
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,280
regulatory approaches and subsidies and

1555
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,680
you know renewable energy targets and

1556
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,599
you know investment approaches and that

1557
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,880
is where you end up with a whole series

1558
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,720
of other

1559
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,839
instruments

1560
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:50,160
all meritorious in their own right but

1561
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,640
perhaps sometimes not entirely

1562
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,960
consistent with what is meant to be the

1563
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,240
the in theory most perfect way forward i

1564
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,599
mean i think

1565
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:00,640
we're going to have to have a more

1566
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,960
constructive open-minded conversation

1567
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,039
involving all the key regions of the

1568
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:06,400
world where

1569
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,720
countries recognize in the same way as

1570
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,880
you do within the european union each

1571
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,760
other's

1572
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,319
genuine challenges and and but also the

1573
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,559
genuineness of your motivation in terms

1574
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,640
of getting to global net zero and

1575
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,039
working sensibly through how each

1576
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,440
country can in the most sensible fashion

1577
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,000
uh manage the transition pathway and i

1578
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
mean the paris agreement actually you

1579
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,440
know in terms of nationally determined

1580
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,880
contributions and

1581
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,359
under article six actually provides for

1582
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,039
different parts of the world using

1583
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,480
different approaches

1584
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,839
in order to get there i mean that that

1585
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,400
was specifically foreseen and for good

1586
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,039
reason but but in the end um you know

1587
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,039
what um

1588
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,520
mr woonsdale outlines that really an

1589
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,960
emission striding scheme or price on

1590
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,160
carbon

1591
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,839
on its own could be the most efficient

1592
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,039
one why do we worry about all these

1593
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:55,280
other things if it was genuinely implies

1594
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,880
in an appropriately comprehensive way

1595
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,799
that would be true but it isn't and

1596
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:00,880
until it until such time as it is

1597
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,559
different parts of the economy are

1598
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,640
trying to and different parts of

1599
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,319
the political system try to come up with

1600
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,480
other levers and and sometimes that is

1601
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,000
not as efficient but that is i think the

1602
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,880
context and that creates the sort of

1603
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,400
issues that you're talking about prime

1604
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,640
minister i'll just quickly you know when

1605
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,240
when you want to find out whether you're

1606
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,000
applying the right instruments you need

1607
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,839
to always come back to the root of the

1608
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,440
problem and see if you apply the right

1609
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,640
principle

1610
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,000
i don't think it's about good guys and

1611
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,839
bad guys i i don't think we should name

1612
01:03:27,839 --> 01:03:29,200
it that way

1613
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,599
if we agree that pollution is a problem

1614
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,960
for this planet then we should look uh

1615
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,440
what are we doing you know in order to

1616
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,400
save it

1617
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,599
and

1618
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,760
from the green perspective we need to be

1619
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,000
realistic sometimes we put things on the

1620
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,039
paper which is not realistic and you

1621
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:48,000
know how we find out whether it's

1622
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,119
realistic

1623
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,720
we put it in numbers we see how much

1624
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,920
it's going to cost whether we have the

1625
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,319
money and whether we have the will so

1626
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:55,839
and this is what we need to do that's

1627
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,760
why the taxonomy i think you know

1628
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,760
speaking of nuclear we are a country of

1629
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,839
nuclear and i and i have very good

1630
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,359
relationship with sebastian kurtz with

1631
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:04,799
austria and they say no nuclear i say

1632
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,559
okay you don't have to have that we need

1633
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,559
to have that and definitely for the

1634
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,720
transition i don't know how many years i

1635
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,480
don't i don't do that estimates some

1636
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,599
people might

1637
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:14,880
but

1638
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,520
but definitely nuclear will be will be

1639
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,480
important will be needed so uh what i'm

1640
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,799
saying let's not measure it by good or

1641
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:23,599
bad

1642
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,200
what's realistic and we're speaking on

1643
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,359
this again and that's why it's so slow

1644
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,039
because sometimes we don't want to admit

1645
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,480
just like you said the starting point is

1646
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:32,400
different country to country we need to

1647
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,160
respect that and we need to work with

1648
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,720
that because definitely

1649
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,119
some countries cannot allow themselves

1650
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,839
politically and also financially and

1651
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,280
also mentally

1652
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,839
such a dramatic shift and we just have

1653
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:48,640
to then say okay if we delay

1654
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,839
this might be the uh the

1655
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,039
the damage to the planet as we see and

1656
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,200
that's why i said please let's not focus

1657
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:58,799
only on europe

1658
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,319
we did already

1659
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,559
so much and we will do more

1660
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:04,640
but but you guys keep setting targets

1661
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,920
and wanting to be the markers of the

1662
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,839
world unfortunately the world's looking

1663
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,839
at us yes but that's the thing and i

1664
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:12,000
don't agree with that let's not put so

1665
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,160
many things on the paper or let's say

1666
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,839
this is on the paper now let's see

1667
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,480
what's realistic and then correct what's

1668
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,160
on the paper because sometimes we really

1669
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,039
we have strong words because we want to

1670
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,319
move

1671
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:25,839
to the crowd

1672
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:26,640
but

1673
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,319
once it's moved then let's put it into

1674
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,839
realistic numbers because i think

1675
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:31,839
sometimes really going off the board mr

1676
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,839
pascal you wanted to come in there well

1677
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:34,640
i

1678
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,799
from the business perspective we can

1679
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,720
only support this uh

1680
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,760
i think this is maybe um an element that

1681
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,280
might uh

1682
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,400
still be

1683
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,079
should be added to this next generation

1684
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,880
eu debate that um

1685
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,640
and this is also some kind of prejudice

1686
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,799
that is always we have towards brussels

1687
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,720
that is more legislation more complex

1688
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,920
legislation um coming up so

1689
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:01,200
maybe uh also to uh

1690
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,079
have some innovation coming and growth

1691
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,039
um

1692
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,760
out of innovation maybe let's also have

1693
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,520
a little bit of streamlining

1694
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,240
streamlining of legislation at the eu

1695
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,119
level that would uh would help us

1696
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:16,319
as well

1697
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:19,280
streamlining of legislation mr ash well

1698
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,760
uh i would not like to talk about the

1699
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,599
streamlining of legislation which for

1700
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:25,280
sure simplification

1701
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,160
always helps to improve productivity but

1702
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,680
i would like to come back to the

1703
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,400
goodbyes bad guys topic it's a really

1704
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,400
huge topic right now

1705
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,760
and i can just agree uh with what we

1706
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,000
said that climate is a global issue and

1707
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,319
everything what is has been said here i

1708
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:46,000
endorse but if we come to the real

1709
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,400
execution what is happening in the banks

1710
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,000
in the banking sector looks a little bit

1711
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,640
different yeah it looks like we are now

1712
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,920
asked to look in our portfolios we need

1713
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:57,680
to say you're green you're red you're

1714
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,480
orange you're white or whatever and we

1715
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,119
need to prepare a scale a scale and it

1716
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:05,599
has an impact because it will have an

1717
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,839
impact because automatically this will

1718
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:10,480
be linked to our credit policies who we

1719
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,400
are going to support in the future are

1720
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,559
we going to support certain industry or

1721
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,880
certain other industries

1722
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,599
what will be the price for the resources

1723
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:21,359
because there will be also fund transfer

1724
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:23,520
price automatically because if i want to

1725
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,359
grow in a certain area i need to

1726
01:07:25,359 --> 01:07:27,359
subsidize and i will give them

1727
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,039
cheaper money or let's say cheaper

1728
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:31,119
resources to do certain things and this

1729
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:33,359
is happening right now so it is very

1730
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,119
much important that we have a clear

1731
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,960
understanding of

1732
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,640
what we want to achieve

1733
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,480
then let's define

1734
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,640
how this should be done or what it means

1735
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,640
reality because this is going to happen

1736
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:46,960
it's going to happen next year all

1737
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,559
international banks are currently

1738
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,760
working on an esg strategy

1739
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,359
we are already

1740
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,000
looking our customer are you black

1741
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,480
whatever color you are it's coming and

1742
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,720
it's coming next year it's not coming in

1743
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,400
three four five years so that's a really

1744
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,079
topic that's the first thing and the

1745
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,839
second what will come

1746
01:08:05,839 --> 01:08:09,760
what i found quite interesting uh is

1747
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,319
according to the requirements all

1748
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:14,079
customers

1749
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:15,680
and i'm talking about

1750
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,640
merely companies they should get an esg

1751
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,359
scoring so what is their impact what is

1752
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:23,198
their footprint

1753
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,120
and what is quite funny

1754
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,600
and i i said from my perspective each

1755
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,759
bank is working on a nice questionary

1756
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:32,479
500 questions data not available not

1757
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,759
validatable whatsoever and we will come

1758
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,759
up with a nice score okay so and what is

1759
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,839
very interesting this customer has not

1760
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,640
one bank this customer might have hand

1761
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,279
banks and he might have the pleasure to

1762
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,560
fulfill and questionary and they might

1763
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,759
not lead to the same outcome so i think

1764
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,238
there's a lot of things which we can do

1765
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:59,439
uh on a national on a european regional

1766
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,600
level in order to coordinate that

1767
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,080
because that will be imminent tasks we

1768
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,640
will be facing

1769
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,080
question from the audience

1770
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,799
i think there's a lot of things which we

1771
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,120
can do

1772
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,000
now one of the issues i want to simply

1773
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,839
tackle and i'm absolutely

1774
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,279
but one of the lessons i think we should

1775
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,839
learn is first of all it's just global

1776
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:30,960
what we're talking about that's new

1777
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:35,640
since 2008 it was just global

1778
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,960
is

1779
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,920
implementation of the sdgs

1780
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,000
ways we can effectively implement uh the

1781
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,880
funds and the recovery itself uh to be

1782
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:15,520
impactful and smarter slovakia yes

1783
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,800
example here

1784
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,000
i'll be honest this this would also be

1785
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,440
we shouldn't have developed

1786
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,120
i always

1787
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,159
a slogan construction for helping and

1788
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,360
always deciding please if you have

1789
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,520
initiatives come on going to bring

1790
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,960
sustainables we don't have to be the

1791
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,640
smartest funding for it i think that's

1792
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:02,400
one smartest people good examples

1793
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,040
when

1794
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,120
i think that's one of the

1795
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,000
good examples of and when we speak of uh

1796
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,840
and when we speak regulation

1797
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,600
et cetera and the regulation policies

1798
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,800
etc try to be as much

1799
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,280
as much understandable as i said

1800
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,120
but not good as i said please help us

1801
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:34,719
we're not good at it please help

1802
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,799
the method

1803
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,360
the last thing never give up don't panic

1804
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,280
and never give up that's a comment thank

1805
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,719
you

1806
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,040
thanks i mean summing up i just think

1807
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,600
it's been summing up

1808
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,280
economic policy

1809
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:48,560
[Music]

1810
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,880
and then

1811
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,530
is

1812
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:24,620
[Music]

1813
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,840
but there are still some things that we

1814
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:32,320
can and must do in order to really

1815
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,800
optimize you know the benefits from it

1816
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,960
um including you know invest better

1817
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,360
investment in universal access to high

1818
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,120
quality digital infrastructure making

1819
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,600
sure that our workforce is uh equipped

1820
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,560
with the skills they need in order to

1821
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,000
also you know get through that

1822
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,440
transition um

1823
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,320
reskilling upskilling of the workforce

1824
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,159
to make sure that people can generally

1825
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:56,239
participate and benefit from the digital

1826
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:58,000
transformation is really important and

1827
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,159
then there's a whole range of associated

1828
01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,400
risks and challenges when it comes to

1829
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,679
the digital transformation that we've

1830
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,760
got to get better on top of i mean cyber

1831
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,679
security and obvious one small and

1832
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:09,679
medium-sized business across many parts

1833
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:11,679
of europe an important part of the

1834
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,159
economy central part of the economy how

1835
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,560
do we get them more strongly into the

1836
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,040
digital transformation but also how do

1837
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,679
we support them you know managing all of

1838
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:24,560
the risks and um disruptions that that

1839
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,159
sort of come with it and then the final

1840
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,400
point that i'll just make um i mean yes

1841
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:30,800
europe has got a big internal market and

1842
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:33,040
and that's fantastic and that's been

1843
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:36,239
very good for for europe's economic uh

1844
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,080
prosperity but you know europe is also

1845
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,520
in the countries of europe are trading

1846
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,239
nations uh globally and and we really

1847
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,640
need to uh we need like-minded

1848
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,159
market-based democracies around the

1849
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,480
world uh to focus on the reforms

1850
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,760
required to ensure we have a

1851
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,239
well-functioning global market and

1852
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,159
you know there's some work to be done on

1853
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,080
that front

1854
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,400
it's rash

1855
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,040
from my perspective point of view

1856
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,640
we have a clear agenda what we would

1857
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,360
like to achieve with uh next generation

1858
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,199
and it goes beyond the green deal it

1859
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,440
goes into digitalization it goes into

1860
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,920
inclusion equality topics and so on i

1861
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:12,960
believe

1862
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,280
i would like to say the first message or

1863
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,360
what i i very much like what vasil was

1864
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,199
saying before we need to be faster and

1865
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:21,360
we need to be more pragmatic in order to

1866
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,360
be faster and more pragmatic we need to

1867
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,640
create the

1868
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,360
the bridge not only between policy maker

1869
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,719
and private sector but also

1870
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,800
cross-functional in the private sector

1871
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,400
because we can learn from each other we

1872
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,880
can support each other and having these

1873
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,360
close dialogues platforms whatever this

1874
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,000
will help us to be faster and more

1875
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,880
pragmatic with a real input and i would

1876
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,920
really invest in this the second topic

1877
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,280
uh

1878
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,760
this is this um

1879
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,600
i would say you were saying it really

1880
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,400
with with the political guidance how to

1881
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,199
bring it down really to reality because

1882
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,520
we will centrally define programs you

1883
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,199
know there's not lines that are we will

1884
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,360
define even blueberries but at the end

1885
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:07,280
we will need regional local know-how

1886
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:10,080
expertise people who will execute and

1887
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:12,800
realize so we need to think how to

1888
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,280
create this know-how in a smaller

1889
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,000
community to then do and realize what

1890
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,600
has been defined

1891
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,520
and i believe this is another very

1892
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:23,760
important uh aspect which needs to be

1893
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,640
thought through because otherwise action

1894
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,239
will not follow or will not bring the

1895
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,320
results we would like to have and the

1896
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:32,560
last but not least i would really like

1897
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,480
to see next year on globsec uh somehow

1898
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:39,040
uh an information of what we have

1899
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,800
achieved in the last year because let's

1900
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,600
not forget there's 20 30.

1901
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,920
yeah and i would really like to

1902
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,840
understand if all the initiatives what

1903
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,000
we are doing discussing

1904
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,120
lead

1905
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,120
lead to the value lead to the target we

1906
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,040
would like to achieve so i would really

1907
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:57,360
like to see okay what did we last year

1908
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:00,640
we were able to do this this this great

1909
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,480
are we on the right track and that's i

1910
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,080
believe it's very much important

1911
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,080
monitoring you might get a little tip

1912
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,679
from the transformation index that is

1913
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,199
downstairs but

1914
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,760
i think looks like taking that in that

1915
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:13,120
on board

1916
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,880
please give a round of applause to this

1917
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,199
panel for setting this theme setting the

1918
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,040
scene for our discussions that will

1919
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,120
