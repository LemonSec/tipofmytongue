1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,120
country

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,960
on on the quality of public institutions

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,120
especially in the spa in this part of

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,960
europe i'm talking about the new member

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,920
states

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,519
we are lagging with the quality of

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,599
public institutions

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
i'm not ready to talk about the

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,600
distinguished old europe but that's

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,520
always the problem the pierre maybe can

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,680
mention his experience

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,400
and the second one is my second caveat

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,760
is that while politically

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,399
really politically extremely unpopular

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,000
uh physical capacity

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,040
as uh as something which is uh

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,239
indispensable for for euro european uh

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,719
for years on the area

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,520
to

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,000
to function better

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,440
making it

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,199
larger and permanent permanent

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,559
i would say

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
this is not a magic

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,680
formula or penis here

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,039
and and just lasting why because i think

27
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,920
that

28
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,199
that

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,680
just to solve fiscal and structural

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
weaknesses and failures

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,320
by adding new and new that somewhere

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,360
else

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,600
this is not visible no this is not real

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
absolutely well you mentioned that the

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,119
kind of new reality that we're living in

36
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,200
and i wanted to hand that over

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
to governor westlake

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,960
and to get a feel really for the kind of

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,119
playbook that you've had to

40
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,200
basically write while you were acting it

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,640
out what have been your main sort of

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,479
learnings that you've taken away from

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,920
the events of the past year and a half

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,960
now

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,479
having in mind that what we faced uh 18

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,280
months ago was really a unique uh unique

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,479
situation unique crisis uh most probably

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,240
or hopefully uh once in a lifetime so

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,280
what was

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
most

51
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,960
impressive for me uh was how quick it

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,520
was possible to find an intellectual

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
consensus on how to react to this crisis

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
so to have this disagreement this

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,639
consensus that we need a breach over the

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,360
the troubling months and uh then the

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,879
response of of both policies

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,520
of course maybe not so much on on our

59
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
side on monetary policy but what was

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,360
really a new element in whole story is

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480
how the fiscal policy reacted it reacted

62
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,920
fast but

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
also

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,959
in a way that we were

65
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
trying to to to construct construct

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,640
during the previous year so the unique

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,280
response of the fiscal policy was really

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,599
a novelty in this crisis and i think

69
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,680
this will be something which will stay

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,840
with us for the next year as well

71
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
very much so

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
you're all here representing eurozone

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,519
central banks and obviously the

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,480
peculiarity of that is that we have a

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,360
single monetary policy across 19

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
jurisdictions and this

77
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,680
obviously stands in contrast to the fed

78
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,319
in the us the bank of england and so on

79
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,360
um governor bunch would you say that you

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
know fault lines potentially have opened

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
um given that reality and do you think

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
it may be time that we had some sort of

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,120
reforms in that respect

84
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
maybe i would like to you know take a

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,280
step back and and come back to a bit

86
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
what what's the conceptual framework or

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
what it was and what it is now the

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
conceptual framework was after the the

89
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,799
the old sharks and the inflation period

90
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,760
in the in 70s and 80s was

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,360
monetary policy is going to do the heavy

92
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
lifting in terms of

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,959
controlling the cycle

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,480
and fiscal policy is going to be

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,159
relatively passive

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,239
automatic stabilizers are going to play

97
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,480
their role but it's stopped there

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,519
and then this idea was but what do we do

99
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,760
uh well the problem was what do we do if

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,480
we are constrained by the lower bound

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,959
and then was this idea that

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,200
instead of being substituted

103
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,599
fiscal and monetary become complementary

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,200
and that when we are faced with a big

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
shock you need a fiscal and monetary

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
response together because monetary

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,720
policy being constrained cannot do place

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,200
there its role basically

109
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,639
what i would like to point out is there

110
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,238
was a big consensus on that and we did

111
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,600
it but beyond that we we were successful

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,120
despite the fact that we were at the

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,199
lower bound and i think this is for me

114
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,360
the biggest takeaway it's not that we

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
did it i'm i'm not so much surprised you

116
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
know when you have people dying in italy

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,840
uh and everybody is being told you can

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,440
spend money and you need to do something

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
we we do it

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,400
um politically it was an easy crisis but

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,560
despite being at the lower bound

122
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
monetary policy could play a very

123
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,520
important role and i think the the key

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
uh metrics there is that we could push

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
interest rates below g so r was smaller

126
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,600
than g which allowed for a fiscal

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
response

128
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,360
uh without having sort of a bad debt

129
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,759
dynamic and so i believe that you know

130
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,240
this reference of being close to our

131
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,560
star is not enough the big question is

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,240
whether you have some room between

133
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,199
between r and g and we were able to push

134
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,160
uh r much below g i mean potential g of

135
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,400
course not g during the crisis

136
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,360
um

137
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
so that's i think quite consensual i

138
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
guess going forward the question is

139
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,919
whether this complementarity close to

140
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,759
the lower bound should lead to some kind

141
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,199
of formal

142
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
coordination between fiscal and monetary

143
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,720
my take on that would be to be short no

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
i don't think we need that i think if

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
the shock is big

146
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
we've shown we can do it

147
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,800
and you know try to

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
set rules about how this coordination

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
should take place is leading us to have

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,639
a discussion

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,479
that is dangerous for independence of

152
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
central banks but that probably also

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639
will find a solution for one type of

154
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,520
crisis but not for another one

155
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,759
and the case in point is what what if

156
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,240
inflation is low but you are back to you

157
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
you know a positive output gap

158
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,160
a lot of monetary

159
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,560
policy people dream that there will be

160
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
fiscal support to go back to two percent

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
honestly i think if we are you know with

162
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,759
a closed output gap or even a positive

163
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,560
output gap just doing fiscal just to get

164
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,319
to two percent given the uncertainty

165
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,479
about whether we get there is is a

166
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
dangerous way and looking a little bit

167
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
to japan i don't want to go the japanese

168
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,840
way but i mean

169
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,360
i think i'd like to pass the same

170
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,520
question to government governor kashmir

171
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,120
just because you mentioned your former

172
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,479
job and um i recall four years ago when

173
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,639
you were here as finance minister you

174
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,039
called then for more reforms

175
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,039
greater integration so what's your

176
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,360
stance today and um you know what are

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,240
the risks that we're facing

178
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
do you see that where we are now you

179
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,039
know so of course for that just i'm i'm

180
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,479
very pleased with

181
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,520
with the

182
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,080
courage of of head of states to to agree

183
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,440
on on

184
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,479
a new generation eu and of course this

185
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
recovery resilience facility is a major

186
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,080
part of that

187
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,280
that's it's it's truly uh for me who is

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
a was a veteran in that time

189
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,199
um and was observing and also observing

190
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720
the this resistance uh against that even

191
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,960
the just that was a taboo

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
word you know if you remember this

193
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,880
process about the instrumentary that

194
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
that's budgetary instrument you know

195
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,199
because

196
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,880
in certain countries i'm not going to

197
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,160
mention them uh the physical capacity is

198
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,479
is a double word so now we have

199
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
as a central capacity is is not the way

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,400
that was not the way just two years ago

201
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
now we just decided to do it in that way

202
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,759
that we have this new seed of capacity

203
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,240
but this is really this is not

204
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,199
not

205
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
the whole story of it anymore i think

206
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,160
it's uh and we'll come to that this is a

207
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,960
fiscal rules this is enforcement of of

208
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,840
the of these rules and uh

209
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,360
and why because uh we are

210
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,759
just we are dealing with a lack of trust

211
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,319
in the europe because once we have the

212
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,319
the problem with for example monetary

213
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,319
physical interaction we would like to

214
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,319
also have a such

215
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,759
agile

216
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,800
uh and

217
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,360
and um

218
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,160
prosperous uh uh partner on the fiscal

219
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,479
side if like fed has in in in us but it

220
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,960
is a different concept because

221
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,080
in my view we have fundamental uh gaps

222
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,559
uh in in our architecture i'm we're

223
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,080
talking about the

224
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
physical uh interaction which is on the

225
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,880
european level it's very very

226
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
complicated issue and once

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,560
what we do need it's it's a real new

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,000
fiscal framework together with

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,880
fair enforcement of less

230
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
complicated rules at the european level

231
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,080
and proper true

232
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,839
fiscal uh central capacity as a dreamed

233
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,279
of endgame in the in the future yeah

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,000
just and all these would allow us to

235
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,959
consider concentrate more on our job and

236
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,920
maybe

237
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
uh worry less about

238
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,839
about

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
how others

240
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,120
might try to play the game

241
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,640
absolutely i think that's an interesting

242
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,399
point about having everyone stay in

243
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,320
their lanes and with that i'd like to go

244
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,800
over again to governor vazque because

245
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,399
we've talked quite a lot about the

246
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,880
positives right of monetary fiscal

247
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,519
interactions but one of the negatives do

248
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
we risk a potential loss of central bank

249
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,399
independence or an abdication of

250
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
monetary dominance um

251
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,040
how do we ensure that these interactions

252
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,839
as they are remain consistent with your

253
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,000
goals as central banks rather than the

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
goals of the fiscal authority

255
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
again i can start with the very same

256
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
thought as before so it was a unique

257
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,880
situation and yes

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
because of this uniqueness we were both

259
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
on the same side of the equation so both

260
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,839
policies were prepared and urged to to

261
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,040
act swiftly and boldly and and very fast

262
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,200
of course the situation will change when

263
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
the the the cycle will change when we

264
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,360
will be on the other side of the

265
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,079
equation where our action will be

266
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,240
needed to to go into the opposite

267
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,040
direction so i i think that then the

268
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,440
understanding and the coordination of

269
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
policies will become much more much more

270
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,600
difficult and of course one more thing

271
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
now at the the main stage there is uh

272
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
there are always these two policies

273
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,440
monetary policy fiscal policy but when

274
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
we return to more normal period then the

275
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
structural reforms will again become

276
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,680
very important and here i i also see a

277
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,000
potential for for further tensions

278
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,279
between central bankers and and

279
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,519
governments and fiscal policies

280
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,279
absolutely what we talk about when the

281
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
situation becomes more normal and i

282
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,200
think a question that many of us ask

283
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,279
ourselves is how long must monetary

284
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,079
policy remain accommodative so crystal

285
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,480
ball time

286
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,079
what's what's your take and sort of

287
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,560
what's the right action to take

288
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,399
well it's going to be data driven i mean

289
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,519
um

290
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
i think inflation is going to be higher

291
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,240
than uh in our last forecast i mean

292
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,680
there are a number of indications just

293
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,920
numbers that came in

294
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,200
in between that that go that way

295
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,079
but

296
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,440
the argument that part of it is

297
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,560
temporary uh in nature is correct

298
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,079
now sometimes i have the impression that

299
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,000
we focus too much on that and that it

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
would be you know we argue it's only

301
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,079
temporary well i think we should convey

302
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,680
the message that hopefully our policy is

303
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,800
going to work

304
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,720
and uh bring inflation at some point

305
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
back to two percent i think it's going

306
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,519
to take place faster than we thought six

307
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,959
months ago

308
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,320
but i'm in favor of being patient uh i'm

309
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
not in favor of doubling the bets each

310
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
time if it doesn't work but i'm i'm in

311
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,279
favor of being patient

312
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,920
um but the exit is going to be bumpy uh

313
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,000
this was the easy part of the crisis in

314
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
terms of policy i mean getting to a

315
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,760
consensus is not always easy but again

316
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,000
the context does matter when you have

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,399
previous crisis some countries cheating

318
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,760
on their uh

319
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,240
numbers and and really big structural

320
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,959
issues is a very different context from

321
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,800
seeing people dying in a hospital in

322
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,839
italy

323
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,399
so i'm not sure uh you should you know

324
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,279
draw two strong conclusions from the way

325
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,200
we dealt with this crisis

326
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
some others will be more difficult

327
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,880
politically but now the name of the game

328
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
is exit

329
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,120
half fast but at some point it's going

330
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
to be accessed on on on fiscal front

331
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,040
monetary front

332
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,279
prudential front and exit is going to be

333
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,200
difficult because it's going to be about

334
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
less instead of more

335
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,959
and so there i fully agree with what

336
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,120
boston is saying uh it's politically is

337
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
going to be much more difficult

338
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,959
uh so the question about

339
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,839
when to miss may be less important

340
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,560
because it's going to be driven

341
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,399
then the question whether

342
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,079
the shift

343
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
that will be required from governments

344
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
to realize you know uh end of the part

345
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
end of party time

346
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,600
uh now it's going to be going back to

347
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
tough choices

348
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,040
and there i'm not

349
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,120
that comfortable i mean i hear a lot of

350
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,800
politicians in my country in other

351
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,160
countries saying

352
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
rates are so low we shouldn't do

353
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,279
anything

354
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,639
all that

355
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,880
come with numbers like my deficit is so

356
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,639
much like that

357
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
after not taking this and that and that

358
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,600
and that and that into account

359
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,000
because that's the new uh

360
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
name of the game is that uh

361
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,399
you know we changed the

362
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,079
instrument to measure the deficits

363
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,320
instead of uh so

364
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
all that points to the fact that it's

365
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
it's it's not going to be that easy

366
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,079
i fully agree with fitpeer on that you

367
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
know at the moment uh

368
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,320
we are the finance ministers the best

369
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,240
friends you know but definitely this is

370
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,720
not going to last forever

371
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,360
and uh that's a new reality which will

372
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,720
come

373
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
hopefully back to normality you know

374
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,320
it's probably new normality with certain

375
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,880
kind of flexibility which is needed in

376
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,079
transitory

377
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,279
uh period

378
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,880
uh but definitely it will come and and

379
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,519
specifically okay the domestic issue as

380
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,040
a country which is surrounded with the

381
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
country with the countries without the

382
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,440
euro you know we are the specific uh

383
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,920
pressure once the inflation is here

384
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
there are the heights after the

385
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,800
this height will will come next year

386
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,360
with the with the the energy prices

387
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,120
which are regulated

388
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,639
uh but

389
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,839
of course the

390
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,480
the central bankers

391
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
in surrounding countries i must be very

392
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,120
uh distinguished and diplomatic

393
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,199
they little bit maybe hurry up with uh

394
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,360
with rates you know but they they have

395
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,480
their own

396
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,959
reasons to do it uh but what we have to

397
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,120
do now to to do it in the right time and

398
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,199
and to be patient and like others say

399
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,519
don't panic and in the moment

400
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,880
don't panic

401
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
indeed um governor wesley do you have

402
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,560
anything else to add there or are you

403
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,199
also in full agreement

404
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,680
i genuinely agree with uh

405
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,920
with what was just said so

406
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
fantastic i think um you know speaking

407
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,079
as we are we're sort of a couple of

408
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,199
weeks away from cop26 so i think we'd be

409
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,240
remiss

410
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,480
not to mention climate change or the

411
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,560
environment at least a little bit

412
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,360
um i wanted to discuss sort of those

413
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,440
dynamic links right between the

414
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
financial system environmental

415
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,160
sustainability i mean effectively like

416
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,880
the pandemic climate change is or has

417
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
the potential to be an exogenous shock

418
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,839
and we've seen on the eu level

419
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,440
various measures for example the

420
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,519
recovery and resilience facility which

421
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,360
provides that kind of scope for

422
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
environmental taxes

423
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,160
i wanted to get a feel from you on your

424
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
take on this and what role monetary

425
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,720
policy operations should play in

426
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,560
supporting this if any

427
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,240
pierre i'll start with you

428
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,440
yeah

429
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,519
yeah i'm a little bit skeptical on that

430
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,199
one i'm going to explain but first i

431
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,199
don't like uh the climate issue to be

432
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,519
associated with the idea of a shock okay

433
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,360
which is like suddenly something is

434
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,440
going to happen and we we have not

435
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,360
planned for it it's going to take 30

436
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
years

437
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,480
and sometimes i've got the feeling like

438
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
suddenly we want to do it all in one day

439
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,959
or we want to

440
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,160
know make sure that the banks know

441
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,360
everything that's going to take place

442
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,160
within 20 years it's it's we you know

443
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,759
it's going to take time for us to

444
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,839
integrate what and and in a way if you

445
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,560
look at energy prices today it might

446
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,040
well be the case that the

447
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,759
the hike in gas prices for instance

448
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,399
represent already three-quarter

449
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,279
of

450
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,240
what's moving to green gas implies over

451
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,839
a 30-year period actually i would like

452
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,680
to go to know exactly what the number is

453
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,559
but in bill gates book he says green gas

454
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,480
is three times more expensive than brown

455
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,039
gas well gas price is just what double

456
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,199
tripled so maybe we are already close to

457
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,640
a shock

458
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,799
but but this is on energy markets that

459
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,039
that for climate will be spread over 30

460
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,839
years now we have a lot of work to do

461
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,839
instead in terms of understanding the

462
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,679
interaction between monetary policy the

463
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,400
economy and the green uh stuff uh we

464
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,240
have to invest a lot i fully agree in

465
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,080
terms of transparency capturing the

466
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,440
risks

467
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
where i'm not comfortable is when some

468
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
people say that monetary policy should

469
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
play a role in terms of allocative

470
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,640
efficiency

471
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,880
you know on relative prices this is not

472
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,200
in any textbook and my concern is

473
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,559
twofold

474
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,280
if you start with that then it it it

475
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,600
opens an extremely broad avenue why not

476
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,640
uh you know try to stimulate innovation

477
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
uh diversity whatever

478
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,880
and and then we have a

479
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,120
very broad mandate

480
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,440
and we are independent central bankers

481
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,120
and what i'm a bit concerned is that i

482
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,880
hear a lot of people saying

483
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,720
the governments are not going to do it

484
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,120
so talking about a policy failure

485
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
so you should do it

486
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
right well you know we live in a

487
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,280
democracy if governments don't do it

488
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,679
first i would not be that uh negative i

489
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
think what the commission is coming with

490
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,440
in terms of the green package is

491
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
actually i think a very good package

492
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,640
i i think the broadening and extension

493
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,960
of ets is is the name of the game if we

494
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,320
can get that it's 80 of the story

495
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,960
and and i only see a relatively marginal

496
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,840
role for monetary policy as such

497
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,600
but we need to much better understand

498
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,280
indeed what is going to be an impact of

499
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,760
green on inflation on any coming growth

500
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,160
on you know that we need to understand

501
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,320
and of course risks but

502
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,480
on risk it's not enough to say oh there

503
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
are market inefficiencies so do

504
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
something we need the metrics if there

505
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,640
are inefficiencies if there are biases

506
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,480
we need to measure them

507
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,320
if we can measure them then we need to

508
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,720
act upon it but on the basis of

509
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,240
something which is more than just oh

510
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,840
i've read a paper

511
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,600
right basically i think

512
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,600
all we have to admit that there are also

513
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,520
other policies i mean fiscal or

514
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,880
regulatory

515
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,600
and

516
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
which are they are much better in them

517
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,280
much better position to deal with

518
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,400
climate change

519
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,280
goals

520
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,160
especially on on day-to-day uh

521
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
basis

522
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,080
uh and here i fully agree that um that

523
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,919
we should refrain from randomly

524
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,720
experimenting

525
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,160
with our monetary policy toolkit uh

526
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,600
and and and and the same i think counts

527
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
for for communication on on that but

528
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,080
it's what's uh what's

529
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
what's quite clear that we are obliged

530
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,559
to deal with the climate change in line

531
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,360
with the mandates so there is a

532
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,520
evidence you know there is a clear

533
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,320
impact on on inflation relative prices

534
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,720
and it's true that that it will be

535
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,360
costly you know for companies

536
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,000
to be environmentally responsible or to

537
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,720
be environmentally friendly

538
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,360
it means that they will be forced to

539
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,640
price in

540
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,120
the part of this additional cause to

541
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
customers

542
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
and of course they will have to also to

543
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,960
change their business models to the new

544
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
reality

545
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,520
so that's that's must be on our radar uh

546
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,480
how to to so which channels uh this

547
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,200
these pressures will will come to uh

548
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,520
will affect

549
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,360
inflation but not only inflation level

550
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,960
but also the seasonality uh volatility

551
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,679
and and that's that's our part of job

552
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:44,720
to do it

553
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,039
okay yeah i would also like to stay

554
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,440
realistic in this very broad debate

555
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,960
which is going on about the

556
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,440
environmental changes and the impact on

557
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
our policies and our response as well

558
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,760
first of all as

559
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,280
pierre mentioned at the beginning it's

560
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
not a shock we are aware of these

561
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,600
developments for a long time now more

562
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,440
and more evidence is coming and it will

563
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,400
be a long term process so there is

564
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,559
literally enough time for us to respond

565
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
and so that's why i would like to be

566
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,440
very cautious on our side it's

567
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,200
it's definitely there are there are many

568
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
policies which which are much better

569
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,480
entitled to to react to these changes of

570
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,640
course this does not mean that we are

571
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,120
not one of them but one has to be

572
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
realistic what our main date is and what

573
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
our powers to react actually are so i

574
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,720
think it's quite appropriate that we are

575
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
well aware of this problem that we

576
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,000
discuss a lot about it uh during our

577
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,039
stretch strategy review process and we

578
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,679
defined the the next steps but

579
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,080
let's let's be let's stay realistic we

580
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,679
are at a very

581
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,840
early stage of of the process in terms

582
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,080
of reaction from from up from our side

583
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
from monetary policy side okay what

584
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,679
shape could responses take

585
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,080
no maybe because i don't want to be you

586
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,559
know completely uh close to the

587
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,240
discussion i think one difficult one

588
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
which is uh to some extent related to

589
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,240
the carbon adjustment tax

590
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
is what do you do about financing of

591
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,200
emissions outside of the union because

592
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,559
again

593
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,000
if the

594
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,520
the most important instrument it's not

595
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,120
going to be only one instrument but it's

596
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,200
ets in europe and and the extension of

597
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,720
ets

598
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
i don't see why we should discriminate

599
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,080
between two companies that are compliant

600
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,360
with an efficient first best solution

601
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,679
uh unless you believe that the price is

602
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,039
too low but then it would be for the

603
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,280
central bank to say

604
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
there is a policy failure and i'm going

605
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
to say clearly that the price is too low

606
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,919
and act upon it which is institutionally

607
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,080
a big issue

608
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,159
so i think i have to make the assumption

609
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,080
as a central banker that politicians

610
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,480
have taken a commitment and that on the

611
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,320
basis of that a company that is

612
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,640
compliant with the eu regulation

613
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,200
i should not discriminate against or for

614
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,080
it but what if the same company would

615
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,400
make investments in other jurisdictions

616
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,440
that

617
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,760
clearly are not compliant with

618
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,280
net zero in 2050 i would be open to the

619
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
discussion and say for that part of the

620
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,679
emission we are going to tilt our

621
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,960
portfolio

622
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,520
we are not going to buy for the part for

623
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,440
the volumes or for the part of your

624
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,039
activities of financing and then the

625
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,720
question is whether you want to

626
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
discriminate financing for

627
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,039
activities in europe or outside europe

628
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,120
but indeed i have some sympathy for

629
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,679
people say it's not your role to help a

630
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,960
company finance the uh investment in

631
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,200
coal power plants in countries where

632
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,960
it's still possible without any form of

633
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,559
regulation

634
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,559
so and and there i make the parallel

635
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,240
with the carbon adjustment tax it's

636
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,640
again it's a worldwide issue

637
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,120
and as was previously said we also need

638
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,960
to think about not only what's taking

639
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,440
place in europe but how we relate to

640
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,679
activities outside of europe and i would

641
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,600
be willing to have that debate as much

642
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,559
as i'm

643
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,039
you know not comfortable discriminating

644
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,200
with companies that comply with the

645
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,039
european rules

646
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,279
in a jurisdiction where we have taken a

647
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,200
commitment and i have to assume we are

648
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,919
going to take the measures to get there

649
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,600
you know if you if you get cheap

650
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,320
financing uh in europe to to do dirty

651
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
stuff outside of europe yes indeed

652
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,080
that's a problem

653
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,720
i can hear a few either sounds of

654
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,080
agreement or disagreement from the

655
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,679
audience so i'm going to open this out

656
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,559
for questions from the audience if i may

657
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,520
um

658
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,760
yes

659
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,080
thank you

660
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,320
mata storage brd poland

661
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,360
and also the european physical board

662
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,039
one argument

663
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,840
um for fiscal policy coordination that

664
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,400
you that you mentioned um and common

665
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,159
physical capacity which is the maybe

666
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,919
ultimate form of fiscal policy

667
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,360
coordination

668
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
is

669
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,200
is effective lower bound i mean an

670
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,360
argument from from your point of view

671
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,240
uh and the lack of monetary capacity uh

672
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
that that the central european central

673
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,480
bank was faced so we heard please from

674
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
from the governors please spend a bit

675
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,159
more

676
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,919
because we we just won't help you

677
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,000
anymore because the rates are at zero

678
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,480
and is regaining this policy space on

679
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,840
your side

680
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
have you heard that something oh yeah

681
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,559
from from

682
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:34,879
christine

683
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,120
i was translating a bit to more lively

684
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,000
languages

685
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,799
but

686
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,520
is trans i mean is regaining policy

687
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,120
space uh uh in in monash sphere an

688
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,919
argument a variable uh that you take or

689
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,360
you would take into account when

690
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,080
deciding on the timing of of rate hikes

691
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
for example is this because we hear a

692
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,360
lot about

693
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,720
uh building

694
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,640
uh fiscal policy space for the next

695
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,200
crisis but is building monetary policy

696
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,039
space for the next crisis a is something

697
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,600
that you you you think about and you'll

698
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,400
take into account thank you and just one

699
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
little question on digital currency

700
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,960
let's answer this question because we

701
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,720
have very little time and a lot of

702
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,559
questions so we'll just take that first

703
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,760
question

704
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,480
i can see governor kashmir sort of

705
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,080
nodding a little would you like to

706
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,400
address the question no matter she's my

707
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,520
former

708
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,480
colleague

709
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,240
from the council so so that just was my

710
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,039
my my question if we we have heard about

711
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,600
that appeal of governor is pleased to do

712
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,640
it

713
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,080
so it's uh

714
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
definitely we cannot be only game in the

715
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,600
town so and

716
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,120
it's okay

717
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,919
just to be very honest

718
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,400
in the beginning of pandemic we were you

719
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,880
know i think we were quite active

720
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,960
and effective to do

721
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,400
some substantial steps in favor of

722
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,919
to just to to pump the liquidity

723
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,480
to the system and we did

724
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
our best and in the situation which was

725
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,320
quite critical

726
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
if you compare with the system or

727
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,080
decision making process among the

728
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
finance ministers there is a full

729
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,399
understanding that it's it's it's much

730
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,399
easier with us you know to do it

731
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,279
but this is our part of of this this is

732
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,520
division of labor you know and it's it's

733
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,480
really

734
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,960
uh this is not been a share from outside

735
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
you know the the monetary policy cannot

736
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
be the

737
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,600
the remedy for all for the

738
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,000
problems in the europe and it it's not

739
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,960
you know

740
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
so and of course just to be realistic

741
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,760
okay i can dream as a

742
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,159
federalist about the physical capacity

743
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,000
but at the same time i know that is

744
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,720
politically unfeasible now

745
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,120
and again we are in a situation and we i

746
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,399
think

747
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,320
we agreed in the ecb that we are going

748
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,559
to preach about that you know that this

749
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,520
is a

750
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,799
this is optimum you know so that that

751
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,799
must be end game that must be vision

752
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,480
somewhere and once in the future

753
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,080
hopefully we can

754
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,200
we can uh just come on on the

755
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,440
on the proper uh

756
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,640
also

757
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,360
assistant or hand in hand together with

758
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,679
uh uh with fiscal

759
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,559
uh

760
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,440
uh with uh the fiscal part of

761
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,200
of uh policy uh to act together but now

762
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,480
just to be very realistic we have own

763
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,679
tools we just went through the big uh

764
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,799
inspection

765
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,600
i mean

766
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,480
i mean our strategic review which was

767
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,120
quite substantial revision of our

768
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,399
monetary theory and and we we have

769
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,200
certain consensus which is quite strong

770
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,039
and we would like to go further you know

771
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,600
just to do new reality which is which we

772
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,880
are going to face

773
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,279
in the coming future

774
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,919
so just very quickly to to uh complete

775
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,000
what you're saying i mean the result of

776
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,159
the strategy review is clear and there

777
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,840
is unanimity we want to rebuild buffers

778
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
you know we want to go to two percent so

779
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,760
the question is what if inflation picks

780
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,760
up more rapidly than we thought

781
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,120
should we

782
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,159
be

783
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,760
extremely patient at the risk of you

784
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,360
know taking some risk of pickup

785
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
inflation we don't control anymore so

786
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
that we don't rock the markets and so on

787
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,159
uh that's one case in point another one

788
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,000
is what if the economy is doing much

789
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,919
better than we thought but inflation

790
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,640
does not pick up or goes back to 1.5

791
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,799
and then we've got difficult discussions

792
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,640
but but i think it has to be extremely

793
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,120
clear we have unanimity in our strategy

794
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,880
we want to reveal buffers it's when you

795
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,240
are faced with difficult trade-offs

796
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,919
outside of the base case that it becomes

797
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,600
a bit more difficult

798
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,120
thank you i hope that answers your

799
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,240
question gentlemen here

800
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,159
let's get a microphone to you bear with

801
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,720
us what's the take of central bankers in

802
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,120
uplifting the role of esm european

803
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,080
stability mechanism so it's a european

804
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,279
instrument

805
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:02,480
that really plays a role specifically in

806
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,039
the in the field of fiscal policy on a

807
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,559
european level

808
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,600
because the potential of esm is to my

809
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,279
extent or to my opinion underestimated

810
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,279
is it really a vision to go into a

811
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,679
european monetary fund

812
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,399
or what is the future of esm

813
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,120
thank you for the question

814
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,039
i'll leave that open to the floor to

815
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,520
choose governor maybe we can ask klaus

816
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,880
raglin

817
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,720
definitely he has his vision with the

818
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,000
vdsm in the future

819
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,840
short but sweet

820
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
um gentlemen over here i believe you had

821
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,440
a question let's get a microphone over

822
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,919
to you

823
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,480
thank you very much mario holtz-naviena

824
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,480
institute for national economic studies

825
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,600
um if some of the current members of the

826
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,919
euro system

827
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,640
several decades ago have been

828
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,960
providing a different type of interest

829
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,120
rates for different sectors

830
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,519
now are there any discussions about

831
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,799
emulating

832
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,919
such a policy maybe

833
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,640
in europe i'm just thinking about so

834
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
different sectors as a

835
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,799
housing market which is

836
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,559
gone crazy and which might be the source

837
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,799
of the next uh crisis

838
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,880
on the other hand they already discussed

839
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,799
a green

840
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,519
sector which might need long run very

841
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,279
cheap

842
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,840
credit

843
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,320
an interesting question again thank you

844
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,880
um i'm going to give governor valliere a

845
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,760
chance to to answer this please

846
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,840
no actually we are not going into this

847
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,760
direction at the moment

848
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,159
you know in the past years there were

849
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,919
other policies which were developed

850
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,399
exactly for these purposes to mitigate

851
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,279
some effects which our monetary policy

852
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,919
might have on different sectors and

853
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,240
these are the ones we are we are using

854
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,840
on a national level at the moment

855
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
thank you very much um do we have any

856
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,919
other questions from the audience please

857
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,799
do make yourself known

858
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,440
not for the moment um i did have another

859
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,720
question i think it's something that

860
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,399
we've we've kind of touched on and we've

861
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,960
discussed um ongoing you know whether or

862
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,679
not these monetary and fiscal policy

863
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,760
interactions are simply an emergency

864
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,799
response um a short-term thing or

865
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,320
whether they are the shape of things to

866
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,399
come and i've heard different

867
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,960
messages from all of you so i wanted to

868
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,640
find out you know which side do you land

869
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,240
do we go back to normal after all of

870
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,799
this is over um or have certain things

871
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,640
changed for good

872
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,679
i'll start i think with governor kasimet

873
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,440
certainly it would be

874
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
very nice we're very helpful to have

875
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,760
very

876
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,320
cooperative and committed partner on the

877
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,480
physical side but let's

878
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,320
let's face it we cannot see this

879
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,039
happening anytime soon

880
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,200
as a as a principle

881
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,399
on i think i'm afraid on the contrary

882
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,360
uh on the physical side we can expect

883
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,039
a very similar experience as after great

884
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,120
financial crisis

885
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,840
this is my my personal view about the

886
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,120
fiscal

887
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,279
action on the action on the physical

888
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,399
side

889
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,600
after the

890
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
pandemic

891
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,480
because i think that exceptional

892
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,440
cooperation and robust

893
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,600
country cyclicality which we have seen

894
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,679
in 2020

895
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,840
was in my view an

896
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,279
exception

897
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,600
that was not something which was the

898
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,039
rule and and

899
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,360
i'm afraid that normalization

900
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,120
will bring uh

901
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,679
all pains all problems and all biases

902
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,279
back

903
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,919
that's in other words all we know that

904
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,440
what would be

905
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,399
the best practice should look like

906
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,519
but

907
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,440
we we are lacking

908
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,480
proper

909
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,120
uh framework and and

910
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,919
it's politically and feasible to deliver

911
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,800
it deliver it now what are the old pains

912
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
and the old vices that we should be most

913
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,520
cautious of returning to

914
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,119
ah this is a certain way of

915
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,280
fragmentation this is about the the

916
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,719
problem with that you know

917
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,599
sustainability of that this will be will

918
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,000
come the fragmentation and on on this

919
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,119
issue

920
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,480
uh

921
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,040
this the country from country to country

922
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,879
will they will differ what can they

923
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,560
afford in the future

924
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
you know so and

925
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,199
and then we will see how the new uh new

926
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,599
deal i mean the new generation you will

927
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,719
will act

928
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,719
in this situation so

929
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,560
so at least that problem with

930
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,679
sustainability of that is is back

931
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,280
as an issue

932
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,119
do you have anything further to add well

933
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,879
i mean what was special in this crisis

934
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,119
was the common shock so everybody was

935
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,520
faced with the same shock worldwide uh

936
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,320
and that allows for

937
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,079
a coordinated answer which is much

938
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,760
easier to coordinate

939
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,599
the likelihood that the next shock is

940
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:10,160
going to be that beautiful common shock

941
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,000
where we all agree on what we need to do

942
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
is indeed not that big

943
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,680
at the same time you know

944
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,119
the rule of the game when there is a

945
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,839
crisis is at some point you forget

946
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,599
uh

947
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,119
the rules of the game that apply in

948
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,800
normal situation you have to make the

949
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,200
switch like financial crisis

950
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
uh you know you want some discipline in

951
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,440
financial markets so if someone

952
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,160
go the stupid thing it goes bankrupt

953
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,079
well when it's a big financial crisis

954
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,359
you have to forget about that and you

955
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,119
have to be ready to go for bailout for

956
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,720
instance what we did

957
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,880
by the way you have to forget about just

958
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,760
you know

959
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,839
uh public tendering and whatever i mean

960
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,680
you call people and hire them and you're

961
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,839
not you know in accordance with the law

962
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,760
because it's a crisis

963
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,599
so

964
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:56,880
you know

965
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,560
knowing what the next crisis is going to

966
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,640
be and how we are going to to react upon

967
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,720
and that's a bit of disease in europe is

968
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,440
that

969
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,720
after a crisis we want rules

970
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,440
to deal with the crisis we just had the

971
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,359
likelihood that the next one is just

972
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,000
going to be the crisis we just had it's

973
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,280
so small

974
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,359
that um

975
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:18,880
you know when the next crisis is going

976
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,720
to arrive it's going to be depending on

977
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,440
the circumstances uh

978
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,720
a specific answer to that crisis easy or

979
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,079
not easy

980
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,320
absolutely i think to sort of wrap up

981
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,680
i'd like to hear from you

982
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,640
like you've just mentioned sort of

983
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,560
coming out of this crisis are we doing

984
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,480
enough um in europe you know if you look

985
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,480
at other global regions are we spending

986
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,440
enough um do we have a clear path out of

987
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,960
this and what more could we be doing um

988
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,040
if i start with governor wesley yeah of

989
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,119
course there is always a space to do

990
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,560
more to do more

991
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,280
more more in terms of quality especially

992
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,079
and

993
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,640
yes i i see some signs of which will

994
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
change the dynamic of interaction

995
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,160
between different policies especially

996
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,400
what we mentioned several times in the

997
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,640
field of fiscal policy so yeah well what

998
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
we learned from this episode might help

999
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,560
us in in the future ones

1000
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,040
i agree that the quality of spending

1001
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,960
will be decisive

1002
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,240
again we are back to these billions

1003
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,480
which could be i think uh

1004
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,760
good flow

1005
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,640
into the uh into the projects which will

1006
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
strengthen the productivity and

1007
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,119
competitiveness of the european

1008
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,240
economy

1009
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,400
and so i would like to dream together

1010
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,680
what like really ask about the esm uh i

1011
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,320
feel agree that this uh institution with

1012
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,280
best practices is ready to play much
