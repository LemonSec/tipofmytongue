00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,320
for a stain for the session of this

2
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,279
title supercharging the economy towards

3
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,760
the danube tech valley my name is elena

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,440
kutzko i'm director of the globsec

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,360
policy institute and i'm going to be

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
moderating this session today

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
you already heard many times today that

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,600
the theme of this conference is the

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,239
recovery but the recovery that is going

10
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,239
to get us to the point that is going to

11
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,719
be better than what we had before and a

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,480
lot of speakers have agreed that

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,640
innovation is key

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,120
the big question of course is how to get

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,920
there

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,559
and how to get there quickly there are a

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
lot of elements that we can discuss in

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,680
this uh relations for example how to

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,920
develop and keep talent how to finance

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,240
the innovation and so on

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,080
you heard from prime minister hegar

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,880
today who basically had a plea on this

23
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,680
stage early in the morning and he said

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
enough words action please so we're

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
going to make it the motto of the

26
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,479
session and we'll try to focus on

27
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,520
practical ideas and practical solutions

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,119
this is also why globsec is launching

29
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,680
the initiative that we are calling the

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,159
danube tech valley the initiative

31
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,560
broadly aims to make the region more

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
innovative and has been endorsed by the

33
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,799
soviet government and the austrian

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,920
government

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
i'll keep you in suspense for a few

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
minutes to explain what it is

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,759

mr minister i'm going to start with you

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,200
can you lead us through your game plan

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
when it comes to making the economy more

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,319

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,879

58
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,440
so once again good afternoon ladies and

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599

60
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,879
thank you for this invitation

61
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,040
so to make it short the most

62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,280
the highest priority which we have on uh

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,040
ministry of economy

64
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
is to make better

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,519
to make a better entrepreneurship

66
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,760
to make better the environment for

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,120
companies

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,360
for

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,760
people who want to create anything

70
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,920
and

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,159
this is very difficult because you don't

72
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,120
have

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,239
one

74
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,200
big

75
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,800
solution

76
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
you have hundreds thousands of

77
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,159
small barriers which are

78
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,720
making the entrepreneurship difficult

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
more difficult

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and now to put it away

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,519
you need

82
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,640
hundreds thousands hundreds of thousands

83
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,159
small steps

84
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,280
so now now to your question

85
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,959
last year

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,159
we prepared 114

87
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,319
concrete small but

88
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,239
114 solutions

89
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,120
to make better entrepreneurship and

90
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,519
this already passed our

91
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,720
national council so this is already

92
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,439
valid for example any changes in tax

93
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,480
laws

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,400
are valid only to 1st january this is a

95
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,280
small

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,840
small change but if you have 114 small

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,000
changes as the world is the enterpreneur

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,199
world is

99
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,639
just better

100
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,959
this year we are continuing

101
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,639
and we have

102
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,840
469 small

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,320
different uh

104
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
improvements it's it's very very

105
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,040
difficult to collect them

106
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,880
to to know about this and

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,500
so it takes

108
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,240
[Music]

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
months and a lot of months but i think

110
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,400
we are

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,320
finished with our work and

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
up until end of this year we can

113
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,400
we can

114
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
put it in parliament

115
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
and hopefully this will also be passed

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
by our national council so this is my

117
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,479
concrete answer what we are doing

118
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,280
and let me let me say one sentence more

119
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
we are not making a big difference

120
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,960
between

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
innovation or between just normal

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,759
entrepreneurship

123
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,360
it is not very very important how we are

124
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,440
earning how the companies are earning

125
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,000
the money much more important is that

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,639
they are earning the money that they are

127
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,759
employing

128
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,199
the people

129
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,440
and

130
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,680
in this from this point of view we are

131
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
trying to make

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
universal improvements universal rules

133
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,758
for all types of company

134
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,400
thank you so much mr minister for making

135
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,479
it very clear that actually to implement

136
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
the big dreams and big ideas you may

137
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
need to make 1 000 very concrete small

138
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,280
steps and do it now thank you for that

139
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
arcade i'm going to go to you next

140
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,280
um we are talking about innovation and

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,800
of course in today's world is the

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,880
private sector that's at the forefront

143
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,759
of innovation i remember i listened to

144
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,000
an interview with you once and you said

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,199
that

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,280
when you were developing your company

147
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,600
you didn't want to be just a normal

148
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,680
local company that would work just with

149
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
local companies you wanted to be a

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,479
really good company and that means being

151
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,160
globally competitive

152
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,080
in central europe we also have a lot of

153
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,840
discussions how to make sure that we

154
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,319
have companies here that are globally

155
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,680
competitive

156
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,479
from your business perspective what do

157
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,479
you think central europe needs to make

158
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,479
sure that there can be successful

159
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,120
globally competitive companies that

160
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
start here and that stay here

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,319
okay thank you for question i think just

162
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,639
couple words why my opinion even

163
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,759
relevant

164
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,039
when i am from philadelphia

165
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,080
because i

166
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,400
grew up in soviet union 30 years ago

167
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,639
moved to united states and the company

168
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,400
actually from our almost 50 000 people

169
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,160
uh more than

170
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,479
40 000 people actually in central

171
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,599
eastern europe

172
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,240
so and for the last 25 years i was

173
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,720
spending probably half of my time in

174
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,960
europe

175
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
this is just for relevance for for

176
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,720
answering the question

177
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,960
it's much more difficult

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,720
exercise actually

179
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,639
because

180
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
first of all when we're talking about

181
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
innovation and i very much agree with

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,319
you it's very difficult term to define

183
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,680
that's why i like innovation or

184
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
entrepreneurship i think it's very

185
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,759
related and it's

186
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,759
if somebody would be asked to define

187
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,440
what's necessary specifically for

188
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,080
innovation

189
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
there are a lot of words people

190
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,759
pronouncing but they are very very fuzzy

191
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,000
so if we're talking about high tech

192
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,919
business in general which require a lot

193
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,400
of entrepreneurs and

194
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,919
hopefully from this there are some

195
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,360
different type of innovation would be

196
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,039
follow

197
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,199
um

198
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,360
20 years ago when we started it was just

199
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,280
difficult to prove that it's possible to

200
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,960
do in central eastern europe because it

201
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,039
was so big difference

202
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,720
so today

203
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
with what happened in the world during

204
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,800
the last 20 years it's all about

205
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
thailand

206
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,000
and availability of the talent

207
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,479
and i think those countries who focusing

208
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,560
specifically on this and will be able to

209
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
transform the educational system quicker

210
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,080
and bring this educational system much

211
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,599
more closer to practicality and put

212
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,799
some leadership in this

213
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
in different balance i'm not saying that

214
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,559
academy shouldn't lead this but

215
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,720
unfortunately based on our experience

216
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,240
and based on

217
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,120
what we discussed academic

218
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,839
very often driving education to the form

219
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,480
of what they were thinking before how to

220
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,279
educate and technology changing so fast

221
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,399
that

222
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,800
it's becoming completely irrelevant

223
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
that's why

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,040
educational system should be changed

225
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,600
should adjust to all technology advances

226
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
and

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,160
some practitioners who actually building

228
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,839
the new system like you understand

229
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,760
people who build in google or building

230
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,560
amazon platforms

231
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,680
couldn't learn it in university

232
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,519
and if it's transferred to university

233
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,080
today by the time it would be done this

234
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,160
people not going to be there so it

235
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,000
should be real real time kind of

236
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,519
aggregation

237
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,320
so

238
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
one more point before i switch i'm

239
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,640
hearing a lot of and we operate

240
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,959
practically in all countries in central

241
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,880
eastern europe today and a lot of

242
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,959
government worry about okay let's

243
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,120
innovate here let's have headquarters

244
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
here

245
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,920
versus we just have smart people which

246
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,560
working for somebody else and i think

247
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
smart people working for somebody else

248
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,839
that's exactly what should be

249
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,120
established should be quantitative

250
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
because then it would be possible to do

251
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,200
something different and for small

252
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,880
countries it's a challenge how to do

253
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,959
and develop

254
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,279
business in this country it still will

255
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,040
be part of the global and as soon as the

256
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,320
clients somewhere in the big markets

257
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,560
then these companies will have to move

258
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,480
like all examples about israel for

259
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,399
example only confirm in this case most

260
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,880
of the high tech in in israel also

261
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,320
moving to

262
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,240
america or somewhere else it's almost

263
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,040
impossible to do differently

264
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,920
so but having right and smart people in

265
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,839
the country and keep them and protect

266
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,760
them that's i think the main

267
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,279
the main

268
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,040
goal it should be because in this case

269
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,240
it's create

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,399
different economy headquarters is a

271
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,720
secondary priority

272
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,720
thank you so much akadi for outlining a

273
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
few things including that the focus on

274
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,399
keeping the people and not being

275
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
obsessed with locations of hq could be

276
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,839
the

277
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,120
possible pathway for the region as well

278
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,279
i just want to encourage the audience to

279
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,880
start thinking about the questions that

280
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,399
you would like to pose and please just

281
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,000
wave at me at any moment and i'll

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
remember that you wanted to uh ask a

283
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,200
question and i'll go now to wilhelm

284
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,399
malterer

285
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,880
wilhelm i created a little bit suspense

286
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,200
about the danube tech valley that we are

287
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,800
trying to develop could you please

288
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
explain to us what it is and why we're

289
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
doing it

290
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,279
well i think we all have consensus that

291
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,440
if we want to be competitive and if we

292
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,519
want to be resilient this is the big

293
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,519
targets of the european union we need

294
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,920
innovation by definition

295
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
and if you talk about innovation what

296
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,360
comes to up to at least to my mind is

297
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,680
do we have the right ecosystem

298
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,800
to have

299
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,880
a strong innovation capacity and

300
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,839
willingness in place

301
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,800
and one of the issues at least as i see

302
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,639
one of the problems we are facing in

303
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,760
this very region here in central europe

304
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,839
that everything is done on national

305
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,200
level

306
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
if you go for instance for the recovery

307
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,440
and resilience programs and if you are a

308
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,920
company acting in this region and most

309
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,440
of the companies are acting in the

310
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
region and not in one member state just

311
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
they have to go to any single of these

312
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,399
programs because all of the programs

313
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,480
look different it's not a surprise but

314
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
its effect

315
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,200
to create such an ecosystem is the idea

316
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,040
behind of this danube tech valley

317
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
initiative

318
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
what do we want to achieve first of all

319
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,920
we want to be a regional platform for

320
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,800
political coordination and cooperation

321
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,320
it means call it p2p

322
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,800
second we want to be a platform of

323
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,279
cooperation and coordination politics

324
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,360
and business call it p do to be

325
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,240
but what we want to be also is to be a

326
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
coordinating and a platform

327
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,360
of cooperation between businesses call

328
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,839
it b2b

329
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
this is the idea behind

330
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
a cross-border idea in this very central

331
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,519
european region alongside the river

332
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,560
danube

333
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,399
it's an open concept

334
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,360
you can start even with bavaria about in

335
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,519
virgin back and go down to the black sea

336
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
that's the river that's the idea behind

337
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,079
and what we are considering to start

338
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
with rather concrete initiatives because

339
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,480
i love your approach to be concrete and

340
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
have having results

341
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,200
first to create a network of

342
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,720
universities and research institutions

343
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,920
you would be surprised if you dig into

344
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,279
how far away this institution still are

345
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,199
even if they are regionally quite close

346
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,959
second

347
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,360
why not to create a network of

348
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,480
innovators accelerators incubators

349
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,639
alongside the river danube and if you

350
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,959
look into the map you have strong

351
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
innovation hubs and centers

352
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,199
but they are not linked

353
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,440
this goes for instance inc

354
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
in regions they go beyond the european

355
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,839
union talk about about serbia talk about

356
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,240
belgrade a very strong hub for

357
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
innovation

358
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,279
third

359
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,600
it would be a nice idea also to talk

360
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,079
about financing because we have already

361
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,240
discussed this afternoon capital market

362
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,079
initiatives

363
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,880
they are existing partially

364
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,959
but on national level

365
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
we do not have such an entity that goes

366
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,560
beyond what's the result then we do not

367
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,720
have we we have trained and educated

368
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
people but the companies are leaving

369
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
because equity is delivered somewhere

370
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,800
else and not in this region

371
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
why not to try at least to have

372
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,480
this regional cross-border approach

373
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,120
we have by definition some businesses

374
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,360
there they are already

375
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,600
alongside the river danube think about

376
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,839
the automotive sector

377
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,839
this is already a cross-border

378
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,680
practically a cross-border project but

379
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,600
it's not really linked

380
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,279
these are ideas

381
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,600
simply to create first of all an open

382
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,480
platform that goes for and as i have

383
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
said that the three different types of

384
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,720
cooperation p p

385
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,959
p b b b

386
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,720
be open

387
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
to europe european countries to

388
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,519
non-european np open on topics i give

389
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,440
you just one example everybody will be

390
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,120
surprised because you are talking about

391
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
i.t and the high-tech and i'm talking

392
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,399
about the low-tech end

393
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,399
do you know that the european union is

394
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,519
importing i think 70 to 80 percent of

395
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,199
the needs of soya

396
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,680
beans

397
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,839
do you know that the river then your

398
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,240
basin is one of the best regions to

399
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,199
produce sawyer

400
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
why aren't we not putting our forces

401
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,839
together to do something together and

402
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,600
this is what we want to achieve to be

403
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,800
concrete and therefore it's an

404
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,519
invitation to all of you it's an

405
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,839
invitation to governments please give us

406
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
advice what do you need and specifically

407
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,600
also to business

408
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
because we want to be we better be open

409
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,959
but we want to be active as globe sec

410
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,920
offering concrete results that's the

411
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
tech danube valley initiative in short

412
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,920
thank you so much avila mr mister you

413
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,440
wanted to jump in straight away yes i

414
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,959
would like to

415
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,519
i would like to try to answer you

416
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,639
why is there in the daily bazan is not

417
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,120
producing we are not producing soya

418
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,639
i think the reason is that we are

419
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,279
producing corn because we can have

420
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,839
better profits for example so i would

421
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,279
not to try

422
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,480
to regulate

423
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
or like to some

424
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,240
uh

425
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,320
try to in several countries to make the

426
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,600
same and

427
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,920
if you have too much regulation

428
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,720
you have lost competitiveness and and

429
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,279
this is this is very important

430
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,240
um

431
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
if you allow i would like a little bit

432
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,560
disagree with you i think it is not

433
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,800
a good idea to try

434
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,480
to unify

435
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,839
the rules in in several countries

436
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,079
because now okay we are small countries

437
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,079
austria is also small czech republic

438
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,760
hungary slovakia

439
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,959
uh very small country but we have we

440
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,880
have we are competitors

441
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,039
we are competitors not only in in

442
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,599
products and prices but also in in the

443
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,679
rules which are

444
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,079
which are coming from government

445
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,760
if if people if the voters are voting

446
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
a good government

447
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,480
which will create smart rules

448
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
our country can be better

449
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,919
like other countries and this is what is

450
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,799
bringing us in in the future and then

451
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,720
which is bringing

452
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,039
really advantages this competitiveness

453
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,720
and you would kill

454
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
the competitiveness with your your ideas

455
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,799
well you are you are you are

456
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,000
actually asked for a business

457
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,720
perspective on this matter

458
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,280
i'm absolutely proud how important and

459
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,640
how strong globesick is treated

460
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,880
yeah uh i will start taking questions in

461
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
a second but arcadia do you mind help us

462
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,520
resolve this dilemma

463
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
listen everybody has

464
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
own perspective

465
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,360
answering so my perspective will be the

466
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,760
country will win

467
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,760
as much as a more highly paid jobs

468
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,320
exist in the country and more smart

469
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,200
people staying in the country from this

470
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,720
point of view

471
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,960
that's kind of simple simple statement

472
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,039
because like with all corporate profits

473
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,799
like headquarters here headquarters

474
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,840
there is

475
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,360
uh price transferring rules and

476
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,799
everything else it's still kind of

477
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,400
equalizing but

478
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,039
people staying and if for example in

479
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,799
high tech and it doesn't matter if

480
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
united states so it's uh slovakia or

481
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,640
belarus or ukraine people in high tech

482
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,919
today paid probably at least twice

483
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,520
or three x

484
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
on average or actually four or five

485
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
honestly okay

486
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
so which means that it's create another

487
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,320
level of economy so that's the goal how

488
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,799
to make sure that these people stay in

489
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,799
the country that's from my point of view

490
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
should be a key government role

491
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,840
then if the rules across the

492
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,280
combination of

493
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,520
countries similar i think it's create

494
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,760
better conditions to focus how to bring

495
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,679
this to the region like if it's possible

496
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,760
to combine because otherwise you compete

497
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
with india you compete with like again

498
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,880
i'm oversimplifying everything but even

499
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,039
countries like poland or ukraine will

500
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,559
have a little bit more advantage because

501
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,360
they are much bigger

502
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
uh

503
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,240
so and then i don't know then complexity

504
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,559
is beyond my

505
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,679
but thank you so much for this

506
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,280
perspective i'm going to start taking

507
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,039
and what i'm going to do questions i'll

508
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,120
to take a few questions

509
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,039
at a time i already have four people on

510
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
my list so don't worry i'll get back to

511
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,960
you and we'll start with a question here

512
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,400
thank you very much katarina maternova

513
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
now i deal with countries ukraine

514
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,600
belarus moldova and further east

515
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
but i spend a big portion of my career

516
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,159
on investment climate business

517
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,480
environment how to make it happen i

518
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,320
think all of the good ideas how much

519
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,840
regulation

520
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
networking the

521
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,400
pathetic situation in the

522
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,200
human development sector bad education

523
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,159
that we have all of that's important but

524
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,120
the one thing that

525
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,960
that i boil down

526
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,799
in my mind

527
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,400
why there is such a

528
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,640
huge reliance on the banking sector with

529
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,960
the anemic capital markets with the

530
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,840
entrepreneurship really start with cash

531
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,240
is boiling down to one issue

532
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,640
and i would like minister and and

533
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,200
yourself to comment

534
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,240
is it about attitude to risk

535
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
because there is a there is both in

536
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,400
western europe and in eastern europe for

537
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,280
different reasons fear of failure

538
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,080
failure you know bankruptcy is an

539
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,360
embarrassment

540
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,679
bankruptcy is something that you know

541
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,280
you failed in life

542
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
whereas when you go to

543
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,880
talk to the entrepreneurs from the

544
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,520
silicon valley they celebrate failure is

545
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,919
this something that is on people's minds

546
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,520
is this something that is really at the

547
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,280
essence of

548
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,080
of

549
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,640
being able to mobilize the private

550
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
capital more thank you so much catherine

551
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,480
could you please pass the microphone to

552
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
uh mr ambassador

553
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,280
uh thank you very much nigel baker

554
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,159
british ambassador um to slovakia um the

555
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,440
other day

556
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,159
boris johnson sort of set out

557
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,000
his challenge in a way

558
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,720
for the united kingdom which was

559
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,240
to create

560
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
uh and sustain

561
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,919
a high-tech high-wage high productivity

562
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,640
economy and he flagged two particular

563
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,720
areas where the government should be

564
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,880
involved one was education

565
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,559
and the other was what he calls a

566
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,440
leveling up agenda ensuring

567
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,679
heading off major regional disparities

568
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,200
in uk's case

569
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,880
it's not all about london it's about

570
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,960
other parts of the country as well

571
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,840
um and i

572
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,440
this is in the context obviously of

573
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,159
global competition and particularly

574
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,159
competition economic competition from uh

575
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,840
from asia

576
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,919
i wondered whether the panel agreed that

577
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,520
this is also

578
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,080
the right recipe in a sense for central

579
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,400
and eastern europe for this region and

580
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,360
if so what the particular challenges and

581
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
perhaps obstacles to that high-tech

582
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,760
high-wage high productivity economy

583
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,840
might be here in the region thanks thank

584
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,760
you so much we'll stick with this uh two

585
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,400
questions for now and uh uh feel free to

586
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
pick up on any elements that you would

587
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,440
like from it and really i'll go to you

588
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,360
first well first of all i love

589
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,600
competition

590
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,440
that's perfect

591
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,360
but the question is

592
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,919
are we really happy to compete amongst

593
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,799
each other just alongside the river or

594
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,320
are we realizing that the real

595
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,799
competitors are global

596
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,120
that's the first question

597
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,039
second the answer for me is clear the

598
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,960
competition is a different one because

599
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,559
we are competing with asia we are

600
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,240
competing with the us we are competing

601
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,480
with total different types

602
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
second questions

603
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,799
for being successful and i love these

604
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,000
ideas that was launched also by by by

605
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
boris johnson you need to have a

606
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,440
critical size

607
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,679
critical size matters

608
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,919
and as we are all small countries in

609
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,480
this region we do not have the critical

610
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
size to be successful in the global

611
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,840
competition

612
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,159
that's the whole reason behind

613
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,520
and third

614
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,600
i think what you cut it had mentioned

615
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,520
this is for me key

616
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,840
we should not make an artificial

617
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,919
distinction between what's the public

618
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,440
the political goal and what's the

619
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,000
business people's thinking i think one

620
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,120
of the key questions is are we creating

621
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,840
an

622
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,480
atmosphere of cooperation also in risk

623
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,400
sharing for instance

624
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,159
are we really on the right track and i

625
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,760
give you one example from austria a

626
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,520
country i know best

627
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,080
what is the result of this famous money

628
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,840
out of there is a resilience and

629
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,000
recovery fund

630
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,240
we are not talking about financing any

631
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,880
longer we are talking about public

632
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,919
grants

633
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,120
just

634
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
big mistake

635
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
if you want to have the private sector

636
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,120
on board invite the private sector for

637
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,200
sharing risk with the public sector to

638
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,679
do the right investments

639
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,520
and this is for me the reason why we

640
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,000
need this partnership approach

641
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,840
and we are not interested in

642
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,000
establishing rules and regulations

643
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,919
that's not our job

644
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,080
we wanna we wanna support to create

645
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,279
exactly this ecosystem of innovation and

646
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,440
partner and partnering

647
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,000
and i said we are way too small to

648
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,080
compete with the big ones we need the

649
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,360
critical mass

650
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,919
in this very central european region

651
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,559
also to play a role within the european

652
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,159
union as such

653
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,799
mr minister i am very sorry i have to

654
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,600
disagree i have to disagree second

655
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,679
time i don't think that we need a

656
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,440
critical size

657
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,120
like dinosaurs

658
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,960
thousands years ago it had also a

659
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,799
critical size

660
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,000
which critical size had tesla

661
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,840
on

662
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,720
beginning elon musk is a one-man show

663
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,480
where is the critical size

664
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,440
of gutenberg 500 years ago or whatever

665
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,720
the critical size of mcdonald's

666
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,840
it's a biggest company

667
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,159
in gastronomy perhaps today

668
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,679
i don't i don't think that this is a

669
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,799
right concept with a critical size and

670
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,240
second

671
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
i would like to react to katarina hello

672
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,039
it's very important i agree also with

673
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,960
you to have public

674
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,159
uh sorry to have private money

675
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,279
private

676
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:04,960
financing

677
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,080
it's it's a it's a wrong mantra to think

678
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,880
that

679
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,919
without public money we will not have

680
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,279
innovation

681
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,840
i don't think that

682
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
facebook google

683
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,880
or hundreds thousands other companies

684
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,880
had public money to start with zero

685
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
and to make a

686
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,440
big

687
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,799
result

688
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,120
oh okay which which public money had

689
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,760
facebook the military sector was the

690
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,960
driver for it development

691
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,799
facebook

692
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,279
facebook is making jobs steve jobs they

693
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,480
make use of it steve jobs had uh public

694
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,760
money

695
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,640
military sector no i said they make use

696
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,159
of it

697
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,840
but public money was at the starting

698
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,320
point also i'm not fighting for public

699
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,880
money i'm fighting for private money

700
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,960
yes what i think

701
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,880
is really important okay the last

702
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,600
sentence please really important is

703
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
to create

704
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,679
to create smart rules from from the

705
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,400
governmental side absolutely and and

706
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,760
then okay we have competition and please

707
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
uh dear companies fight

708
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,960
fight also here again one against the

709
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,240
second not all companies against china

710
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,320
this will not work i am afraid mr

711
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,919
minister can also ask you to answer

712
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,679
ambassador's question about whether you

713
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,480
agree that the education and the

714
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,919
origin

715
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,399
eliminated regional disparity is also

716
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,320
the right path for slovakia to go

717
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,159
forward yes i think in this question we

718
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,559
all will agree education is a crucial

719
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,440
point and this is also an area

720
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,080
where where state where government can

721
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,399
be very active can

722
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,200
can

723
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,240
reach

724
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,320
good strong results

725
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,120
and

726
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,200
unfortunately i have to say

727
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
the education in slovakia is an area

728
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,520
where

729
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,240
it's a lot of space for improvements a

730
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,840
lot of space i

731
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,640
i

732
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,960
use this formulation

733
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,279
but that's probably not your ministry

734
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,799
thank you so much for that arcadia i'll

735
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:13,360
move to you and i know that

736
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,440
katarina's questions about the culture

737
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
of taking risk has not been answered so

738
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,039
if you want to check in on that

739
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,520
culture of taking risk and the fear of

740
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,080
risking the reason

741
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,000
so i think

742
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,120
i think it's a little bit overrated

743
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,159
because

744
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,039
silicon valley

745
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,559
exists when

746
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,760
entrepreneurs very often not taking risk

747
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,919
of their own money entrepreneur taking

748
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,440
risk of

749
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,000
private equity money so basically the

750
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,320
risk not on their side

751
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,399
in this situation and start have risk on

752
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,080
private equity side

753
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,279
so and uh

754
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,720
i think that's true but it's very very

755
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,960
specific ecosystem of silicon valley

756
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
which very difficult to replicate in

757
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,559
short period of time so it will take

758
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,360
really good time before

759
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,840
number of significant number impactful

760
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,000
number of this type of private equity

761
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,760
would be

762
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,080
organized somewhere in some specific

763
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,120
region

764
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,919
okay

765
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,440
so that's

766
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
my point but it's not about so much

767
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
entrepreneurs

768
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,120
what what you are saying that probably

769
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,279
entrepreneurs have

770
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,919
less opportunities because there is no

771
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,880
this system to to try

772
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,760
still

773
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,600
difficult for me to comment i'm coming a

774
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,360
little bit from different technology

775
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,559
background

776
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,480
and

777
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,799
not sure this is the primary primary

778
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,720
problem

779
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,360
i i would like to repeat still like when

780
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,200
we're talking about different countries

781
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,200
companies in the country that

782
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
again the main the the only possible

783
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,840
measurement it's people in the country

784
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,760
who are doing

785
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,640
difficult high-tech intellectual job

786
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,399
because as soon as the company is

787
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,200
successful company stops thinking most

788
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
of them stop thinking about them as a

789
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,520
u.s company or german company they

790
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,000
become a really international company in

791
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,480
the whole innovation ecosystem this is

792
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,640
kind of the

793
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,880
uh

794
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,320
fundament for this

795
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,799
for this creation i think the the most

796
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,000
famous high-tech company

797
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,320
in europe let's say sap

798
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,399
okay in the world nobody's thinking

799
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,480
about sap as a german company and it's

800
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,960
not a german company anymore they have

801
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,799
huge presence everywhere

802
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,559
but the whole point how many people

803
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,360
still doing software in waldorf and uh

804
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,640
other other locations there and

805
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,600
i

806
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,159
agree with you that some rules like

807
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
should be created better balanced across

808
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,880
number of small companies okay because

809
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,039
it would be easier to operate for those

810
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,120
companies which would grow and create

811
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,120
jobs otherwise like us

812
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,080
percent of my job going through one

813
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,039
jurisdiction to another jurisdiction

814
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,320
having like

815
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,799
hundreds of managing directors

816
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,080
while

817
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,080
for the com for the country the benefit

818
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,159
would be if we would have thousands of

819
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,080
good engineers in the country and do it

820
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,600
quickly

821
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,000
from this point of view i think it might

822
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
might make sense to establish the rule

823
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,760
it's not about investment so much as

824
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,600
well because like as soon as you find

825
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,000
these rules and simplify infrastructure

826
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,919
think about it in u.s you open one

827
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,679
country and operate it in 50 states

828
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,200
in ukraine you create one country

829
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,640
operate across

830
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,600
35 million people

831
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,760
and in czech republic in slovenian

832
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,799
slovakia and croatia and montenegro and

833
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,840
whatever

834
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,600
that's a real headache

835
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,000
um may i please short

836
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,320
one sentence if possible

837
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
okay

838
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,399
i understand and i

839
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,840
i agree with you it's very difficult to

840
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,080
in every country to have an other

841
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,559
legislation and this small country never

842
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,919
going to win period okay but but

843
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,200
for example tax law

844
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,080
the slovakian tax law has nearly 50 000

845
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,279
words all all taxes another income tax

846
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,799
law okay

847
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,039
and austrian has

848
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,559
17 or 100 000 i don't know but if we

849
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,200
would if we would let it make european

850
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,720
union

851
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,640
it would be have five hundred thousand

852
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,159
dollars and it would be much more

853
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,960
complicated i am i am afraid this it

854
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,880
would be much more complicated if you

855
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,279
would let down let's do this european

856
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,240
union or some some higher authority i i

857
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,320
cannot imagine how we should have a

858
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,200
common tax law in 10 countries this is

859
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,080
not possible no no

860
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,360
taxation without representations we

861
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,480
okay we can think we can think about

862
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,799
this to end but this means

863
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,799
to join to one

864
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,320
country like usa i think

865
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,399
there's a willingness for this is not

866
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,360
given here in europe yeah richard i like

867
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,159
uh

868
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,679
listen

869
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,200
we can discuss this issue a little bit

870
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,799
later because there are a lot of people

871
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,880
who are queuing up to have questions i

872
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,360
have three people on my list i have a

873
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,120
question over there

874
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,240
and then here and here and i remember

875
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,320
you everybody

876
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,240
thank you very much anton spiesak i'm a

877
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,600
head of economic policy at the atomic

878
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,159
bar institute i work in london i have

879
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,640
this iphone in my hand which not many

880
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,000
people know that actually steve jobs

881
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
maybe didn't benefit from public money

882
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,720
but

883
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,039
a lot of technologies behind iphone were

884
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,720
financed by

885
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,640
almost entirely by public finances

886
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,200
throughout the 50s 70s 60s and 70s in

887
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,399
the us

888
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,239
and not just that if we talk about elon

889
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,480
musk he has actually taken huge huge

890
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
public investments on loans from the us

891
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,040
government that's just a side note but i

892
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,359
think the serious point i wanted to make

893
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,440
is that there is a huge huge market

894
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,960
failure in this region when it comes to

895
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,079
innovation

896
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,960
the average eu 27

897
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,280
spending on r d and that includes public

898
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,918
and private is around two percent

899
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,800
in slovakia it's 0.8

900
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,960
0.8 of r d public and private ghost

901
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,599
finance research and development it's

902
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,839
astonishingly small there is a huge

903
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,280
market failure

904
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,760
and to think that entrepreneurship

905
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,399
support alone will resolve this failure

906
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,918
without active industrial policy without

907
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,480
active innovation policy without serious

908
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,960
public commitment to spending money

909
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,240
is completely nonsensical and this is

910
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,320
economics 101

911
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,880
market failure's basic r d is really

912
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,240
really important

913
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,400
and i i i cannot believe i have to say

914
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,200
this

915
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,839
uh but it is actually true

916
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,599
we get the point thank you so much we'll

917
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,560
get back on the market failure

918
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
versus regulation and i'll take two more

919
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,880
questions one question over here and

920
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,599
roland over there

921
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,320
again uh

922
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,839
from slovakia daniel

923
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,400
will be for arcade and generally you

924
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,480
know we are semiconductor company with

925
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,920
also software

926
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,880
and what i see you know

927
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,640
kind of first stepping stone on

928
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,400
worldwide competition is

929
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,839
effectively contracting you know uh

930
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,599
and contracting

931
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,160
i would guess that probably produces two

932
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,599
hundred thousand dollars per head

933
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,640
quarter million per head revenue roughly

934
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,359
at least in in at least based on india

935
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,320
numbers less than 20 million now

936
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,720
the next step is product companies for

937
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,800
example nvidia is one and a half to two

938
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,880
million dollars per head

939
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,320
per person

940
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,480
and the question is uh

941
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,880
how on

942
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,079
when

943
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,760
basically in our region we can

944
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,960
transition

945
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,119
or create an environment that we can

946
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,520
have just service company but move to

947
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,920
product companies

948
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,760
thank you so much and i'll take one more

949
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,079
question

950
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,560
thank you roland freudenstein vice

951
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
president of globsec and let me just

952
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,119
throw in another idea here to to the to

953
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,880
the many estonia you know when i think

954
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,880
tech and a

955
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
sorry about the term formerly communist

956
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,560
country or a central east european

957
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,440
country estonia comes to mind but by the

958
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,920
magazine wired it was named

959
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,240
the most advanced digital society in the

960
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,160
world

961
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,800
among other things because they have

962
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,960
e-government government services are 99

963
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,839
uh online and and and here's another

964
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,359
point where i i don't want to gang up

965
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,359
against mr sulik here but there's

966
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,119
another point where government comes in

967
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,280
and can play in it at crucial roles not

968
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,800
only education it's not only r d it is

969
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,640
e-government as a catalyst for the

970
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,400
digitalization of society and it's just

971
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,560
my little point here thank you so much

972
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,119
so we have three questions the uh market

973
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,280
failure on innovation how to create the

974
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,880
product companies and other service

975
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,760
companies and the e-governance as the

976
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,000
catalyst of innovation mr minister would

977
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,680
you like to go first

978
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,880
um no

979
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,720
perfect then we're going to go to arkady

980
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,680
uh

981
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,560
like very very simple this is like huge

982
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,079
questions which you're asking about

983
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,160
again services company which is

984
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,960
empowerments versus product companies

985
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,440
which is

986
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,040
and the answering specifically when and

987
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,760
you're using like whatever 200 per head

988
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800
50 per head or 2 million per head first

989
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,079
of all

990
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,960
that's huge over simplification of

991
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,880
everything because

992
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,640
product company

993
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
might have 10 people

994
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,240
and spend

995
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,079
90 percent of their

996
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,640
revenue on marketing

997
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,480
so that's why dividing by people it's so

998
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,400
artificial metric

999
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,079
and there are a huge number for the

1000
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,320
companies which losing money and have

1001
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,720
huge revenue per person and losing money

1002
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,480
because spending more

1003
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,560
on effort to sell something which is not

1004
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,240
sellable

1005
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,520
so

1006
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,880
versus

1007
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,800
into the world there is no black and

1008
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
white it's like kind of in the middle

1009
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,920
in enterprise world in government world

1010
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,119
like any product today it's like 20 30

1011
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,960
maximum

1012
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,880
portion of the solution

1013
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,720
there are so many

1014
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,280
classical product software in enterprise

1015
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,960
sitting on the shelves

1016
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,320
unused and spent a lot of money that

1017
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,400
it's like

1018
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,480
impossible to talk about that's why

1019
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,800
it's not about again

1020
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,040
for me it's simple metric

1021
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,240
number of jobs created in the country

1022
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,359
high paid and loyalty of the people to

1023
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,520
stay in the country that's what matter

1024
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,960
everything else

1025
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,839
it's

1026
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,119
bad

1027
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,240
sign of bad politics playing

1028
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,599
product versus series or whatever

1029
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,320
so this is again that's my opinion

1030
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,280
on e-government i don't know like i'm

1031
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
not an expert at all in this area in the

1032
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,640
first one i'm pretty confident

1033
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,240
and uh

1034
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,960
estonia is a great example the only

1035
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,119
problem that it's a very very small

1036
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,320
country

1037
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,760
and it's very very kind of

1038
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,400
relatively easy to do so as soon as you

1039
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,240
go and started to compare this with

1040
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,240
something more sophisticated it's much

1041
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,760
more difficult but that's a

1042
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,599
good goal but also

1043
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,800
i don't know exactly like that should be

1044
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,040
done the problem is

1045
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,640
that estonia or singapore

1046
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,000
or maybe couple other examples where our

1047
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,119
country very small

1048
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,000
or sorry democracy is very weak

1049
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,480
and then you're doing all of this

1050
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,319
so and successfully

1051
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,920
otherwise it's becoming very very

1052
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,599
difficult

1053
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,520
thank you so much arkady really i'll go

1054
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:50,400
next to you then uh just

1055
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,280
to

1056
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,599
to ideas for food for thoughts why i

1057
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:55,200
think it's important

1058
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,520
at this regional cooperation

1059
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,280
in europe we are talking about capital

1060
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,720
market union

1061
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,000
which simply does not exist

1062
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,280
we are talking about it's not existing

1063
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,760
why not to start an initiative from this

1064
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
region to create at least something

1065
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,160
unregional

1066
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,240
because if you go for a private investor

1067
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,319
coming from abroad and asking whether

1068
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,079
you're interested to go there for

1069
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,440
private equity

1070
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,079
and as i've told you beforehand the the

1071
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,440
answer is you need 27 lawyers if you

1072
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,280
make wanna make something or in this

1073
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,599
region you need at least 15 or 20

1074
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,960
lawyers

1075
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,200
why not give it a try i'll give you a

1076
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
second example we are talking about

1077
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,359
green transition i want to have an

1078
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,000
energy i want to have a discussion where

1079
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,720
do we achieve the cheapest possibility

1080
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,079
for green energy transition the cheapest

1081
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,880
because this is one extremely important

1082
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,160
basis for for for business

1083
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,079
are we talking about the most efficient

1084
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,640
solution here in this region

1085
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,480
we are not

1086
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,160
whereas the energy markets are

1087
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,319
interlinked with the interconnectors

1088
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,079
better or worse

1089
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,000
it's it's an issue

1090
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,160
and the economy is so strongly linked in

1091
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,839
this region we should give this not just

1092
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:17,680
a try for me it's a simple need rdi last

1093
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,920
example

1094
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,319
is it really necessary that every

1095
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,480
everybody is doing the same on basic

1096
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,920
research

1097
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,040
no shouldn't we share our our capacities

1098
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,400
and our knowledge

1099
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,280
and make a really strategic discussion

1100
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,760
about the question who is doing what and

1101
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
sharing the experience

1102
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,119
we are not rich enough

1103
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,680
but if we join forces we can achieve

1104
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,560
more

1105
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,520
that's the whole idea behind

1106
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,960
yes mr minister now basic r d

1107
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,560
is

1108
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,960
one very good example where it makes

1109
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,319
really sense

1110
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,400
to connect uh

1111
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,280
to to come together to join

1112
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,240
uh our forces and and uh

1113
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,079
um enforcement so

1114
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:08,319
okay basic r d

1115
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,240
slovak state east slovak government is

1116
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,800
already financing basic r d in

1117
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,040
universities or we have slovak academy

1118
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,079
of science i suppose slovak academy of

1119
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,640
science is working of austrian us

1120
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,079
working together

1121
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:24,000
and coordinating themselves with other

1122
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,040
academy of sciences in other countries

1123
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,200
i suppose i don't know but

1124
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,560
this makes this makes sense okay

1125
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,319
but

1126
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,319
i i think it's it's a really mistake to

1127
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,680
try to put

1128
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,720
all together try to unify because as i

1129
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,280
told on the beginning we will lost this

1130
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,880
competitiveness

1131
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
and my answer to the

1132
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,920
to young men there

1133
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,319
i am part of the government i have a lot

1134
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,720
of information i have access to a lot of

1135
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,640
information and

1136
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,560
we should not forget

1137
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,800
the money which will

1138
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,040
which we want to use for

1139
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,119
supporting innovations and so far the

1140
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,599
money is not falling from the heaven

1141
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,880
the money have to earn people and they

1142
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,040
are paying it in taxes

1143
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,839
we have some special special case with

1144
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,240
money from european unions this seems

1145
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,880
like to be fallen from the heaven from

1146
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,359
our point of view okay we are using this

1147
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:28,640
money like other countries but

1148
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,640
for example i don't know

1149
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,760
about one successful i.t project

1150
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,240
financed by the government in slovakia i

1151
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,440
don't know but i know a lot of

1152
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,520
i.t projects coming from from the

1153
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,040
private sector

1154
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,400
and not financed by by the

1155
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,880
public money

1156
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,560
thank you so much and i'm going to go

1157
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,520
back to the questions i saw there was a

1158
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,599
question here do you want do you want

1159
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,839
please go ahead with a question and

1160
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,839
please keep praising your hands if there

1161
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,359
are more interest in the audience as

1162
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:02,560
well

1163
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,359
thank you very much uh andre stanczyk a

1164
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:06,880
member of parliament

1165
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,560
of coalition

1166
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,880
um my question is there was a question

1167
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,599
about the public funding on investments

1168
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,520
and

1169
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,520
innovations

1170
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,760
and for me the the basic question is

1171
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,480
that

1172
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,560
we are competing in global market as was

1173
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,280
said and even if we don't let's say

1174
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,480
support emerging technologies

1175
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,440
china will do it or the us will do it

1176
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,480
so

1177
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,000
i'm kind of on the

1178
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,400
stronger together side but my question

1179
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,720
is how can we

1180
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,280
compete with such a giant as china or

1181
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,920
united states and on the one hand to

1182
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,040
support new merchant technologies

1183
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,960
when they are starting on the s-curve

1184
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,280
because we need to do that simply

1185
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,440
but on the other hand to prevent

1186
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,800
zombification

1187
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,640
just to pay them with public money and

1188
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,560
keep them alive on the expense of

1189
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,040
taxpayer and if if they are not

1190
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,520
effective then they will fail anyway so

1191
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,760
that's my question like how to set

1192
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,480
the support of public funds

1193
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,680
in order to compete but not to make it

1194
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,640
basically useless than just dependent on

1195
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,079
taxpayers money

1196
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,599
thank you so much i think there was a

1197
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:21,440
question over there i use

1198
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,400
please go ahead

1199
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,079
thank you as mr sulik said

1200
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,640
the dinosaurs are not competitive or

1201
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,079
something like that

1202
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,960
he's right but it does is for my opinion

1203
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,839
not a question of the size of companies

1204
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,079
is the size of the critical mass of

1205
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,000
markets indeed

1206
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,160
i need a big market

1207
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:46,960
and

1208
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,200
i t business for example

1209
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,920
that a small company has a market to

1210
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,440
grow

1211
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,440
that i think it's very much important

1212
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,240
that is the advantage

1213
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,400
that is the advantage of

1214
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,240
thank you the advantage of the united

1215
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,599
states or

1216
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,839
china towards europe because we have no

1217
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:07,599
digital market

1218
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,880
set until now and we have not done a

1219
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,880
capital market together to get venture

1220
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,599
capital there's other two mistakes

1221
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,520
and therefore i have some sympathy

1222
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,280
events

1223
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,839
willie mortar has said so long we are

1224
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,920
not able to do it fully on the european

1225
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,559
level do it in a smaller level in order

1226
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,880
to be better it's always better as just

1227
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,800
what country does it it would be

1228
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,839
progress and better chances

1229

1263
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
question from the lady behind you

1264
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,359
thank you very much martin allen

1265
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,680
according to teresa of the gaia x hub

1266
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,760
slovakia and also industry innovation

1267
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,800
cluster

1268
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,119
i have two questions

1269
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,800
i think that

1270
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,680
it is really important that to know that

1271
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,400
also competitors today cooperate

1272
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,440
together for example it is the project

1273
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,400
based on gaia x it is a catena x project

1274
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,400
which is really for the for the

1275
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,000
automobile sectors

1276
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,839
and it is lead by bmw and by volkswagen

1277
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,200
so the

1278
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,599
today the situation is that we need to

1279
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,000
cooperate together so this is the reason

1280
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,240
why to cooperate in the european level

1281
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,680
is really important for us so i think if

1282
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,400
we will not be as a companies also as an

1283
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,800
automobile country to be involved in

1284
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,400
such big projects as the gaiax katnik's

1285
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,760
euro program is it is where it could be

1286
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,160
very difficult for other companies for

1287
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,680
other smes

1288
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,880
and the

1289
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,200
second question is

1290
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,559
that for example

1291
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,880
i understand your business view i am

1292
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,119
businesswoman also i have my own sme

1293
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,960
and

1294
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:07,760
if

1295
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,920
another countries use

1296
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,800
another company's use for example the

1297
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,680
aero phones or the the public money for

1298
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,280
innovation for investing for data

1299
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,720
economy

1300
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,800
we couldn't forgo data economy it is not

1301
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,119
only about innovation it is almost about

1302
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,760
data economy and data industrial economy

1303
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,640
and we are industrial country so if you

1304
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,760
if if we will not as slovakia don't use

1305
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,119
this public money and the other

1306
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,760
countries will use if we will not

1307
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,319
decrease our competitiveness of slovakia

1308
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:39,280
thank you

1309
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,800
thank you so much we have a set of

1310
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,720
questions uh please it will be your last

1311
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,480
chance to make remarks so try to say

1312
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,319
everything you want to say so we had the

1313
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,119
questions about how to finance what

1314
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,720
needs to be financed and but not to

1315
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,359
finance zombies competing cooperation of

1316
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:56,000
competitors uh smart public financing

1317
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,920
taking into consideration that others

1318
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,800
are doing it as well mr minister

1319
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,559
okay thanks i will start

1320
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,079
with the lady

1321
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,000
yes this is a very difficult question

1322
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,079
what what we can do or which

1323
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,960
possibilities we have if other countries

1324
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,040
which we which we are competing with

1325
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,839
them are using public money for a lot of

1326
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,400
projects answer is we have to do the

1327
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,520
same

1328
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,880
in this difficult and wrong situation

1329
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,119
okay we have and we are using public

1330
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:27,359
money just to be

1331
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,599
competitive with other countries

1332
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,280
but this

1333
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,760
is not changing my opinion

1334
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,480
that this is wrong way what the

1335
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,720
governments should do

1336
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,920
is to create smart rules

1337
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,240
we are living in an overviewed world we

1338
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,359
have

1339
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:48,079
rules for completely other things in

1340
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,520
this world and i think this is not

1341
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,160
necessary we should have

1342
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,559
less much less

1343
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:55,520
rules

1344
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,640
and

1345
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,280
much smarter rules this is my opinion

1346
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,520
but yes we have to do the same like

1347
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,200
other countries

1348
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,599
then it was a question about the energy

1349
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,559
energy but before uh

1350
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,880
uh i would answer i'd like to answer mr

1351
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,760
stanczyk how we can compete with china

1352
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,599
for example

1353
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,880
so

1354
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,200
i think not with public money this is

1355
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,839
not a i know china is using a lot of

1356
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,240
public money but uh

1357
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,720
look we are also using a lot of public

1358
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,839
money and

1359
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,920
have a look on the industrial production

1360
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,319
in europe it's going down this is a good

1361
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,160
development so we should

1362
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,559
we should really try to think in a new

1363
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:37,440
way

1364
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,079
to think out of the box feel like

1365
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,520
for example

1366
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,520
because this is not the right way we

1367
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,000
don't have the results we are making a

1368
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,920
lot of conferences about how to

1369
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,160
how to support innovations but it's not

1370
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,880
working we want i agree

1371
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,160
mr brock with this unique market it is a

1372
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,079
good idea to have a unique market to

1373
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,880
have a big market but we should really

1374
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,240
we should try to have a big

1375
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,880
competition between countries between

1376
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,359
governments which are fighting with

1377
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:14,800
better or wronger rules and now about

1378
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,920
energy is a little bit other issue so i

1379
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,160
will be very short

1380
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,520
we have

1381
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,599
we spent a lot of time

1382
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,800
in last two weeks just about because the

1383
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,400
prices are going home

1384
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,920
going very high

1385
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,480
i think the reason is one

1386
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,280
very strong

1387
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,040
demand oh yes

1388
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,119
so we have very strong demand after

1389
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,680
after the corona crisis economy is

1390
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,079
coming back so it's very strong demand

1391
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,400
and the second is a conflict

1392
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,200
uh

1393
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,000
belonging regarding the north stream two

1394
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
and i suppose in next three four months

1395
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,240
uh

1396
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,119
over the winter the situation will be

1397
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,480
better again

1398
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,319
and more uh

1399
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:07,599
the situation we will stabilize

1400
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:10,400
especially in slovakia we are we are in

1401
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,359
a good situation with households with

1402
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,400
people

1403
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,960
the s pepe the slovak gas company has

1404
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,720
enough contracts

1405
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,240
to deliver to good prices for the wall

1406
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,200
next year so below

1407
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,839
the prices will come back to

1408
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:33,280
the year 2020. if you if you have a look

1409
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,160
on the development of gas prices it's

1410
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,240
it's like so and last and this year 21

1411
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,119
it it is coming strong

1412
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,599
it is a strong decrease and we will come

1413
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,079
back so next year we will have

1414
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,280
similar prices like last year and

1415
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,480
electricity is the situation thanks to

1416
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,440
our nuclear power plants uh

1417
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,720
it's also

1418
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,839
i think

1419
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,000
we have good messages okay we will have

1420
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,200
a price increase but is not so high it's

1421
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,400
perhaps

1422
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,520
15 percent it make three or four euro

1423
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,720
for average household per month three or

1424
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,559
four euro euros and the minimum salary

1425
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,760
increased by 23 average salary increased

1426
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,480
by 60 or 70 euro euros per month and

1427
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,200
prices on electricity for electricity

1428
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,280
will increase by three or four so i

1429
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,359
think this is not a dramatic uh

1430
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:34,640
situation and slovak republic has

1431
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,760
uh is in a really good situation

1432
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,720
thanks to our nuclear plants

1433
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,079
and last remark i cannot until today

1434
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,160
understand why germany is taking uh the

1435
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,559
nuclear power plants taking away from

1436
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,359
the nets i i don't understand this it's

1437
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:55,599
a very wrong

1438
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:56,960
decision

1439
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,359
thank you so much mr minister uh archive

1440
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,119
i'll go back to you and very tempted to

1441
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,640
ask you whether you're worried about

1442
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,559
your competitors using public money

1443
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,040
what i'm worrying about

1444
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,599
my competitors with the public money

1445
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,599
whether you're worried that competitors

1446
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,079
are receiving the public money and hence

1447
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,000
you're at a disadvantage if you don't

1448
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,799
receive public money

1449
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,319
uh

1450
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:24,480
listeners in different geographies we

1451
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,880
were receiving public money as well not

1452
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,960
directly but some sort of special

1453
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,720
incentives

1454
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,079
so and

1455
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,200
i think

1456
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,440
if it would be done on

1457
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,160
not exclusion basis we shouldn't worry

1458
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,079
about it we need like to see how to put

1459
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,440
this in

1460
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,720
good

1461
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,880
uh

1462
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,839
good direction for ourselves as well

1463
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,839
so

1464
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,480
but again the whole point that is

1465
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,280
whole point the public money should be

1466
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,400
directed to the real opportunity

1467
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:00,960
not just

1468
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,839
given

1469
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,359
so i think in

1470
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:05,680
several jurisdictions where we were

1471
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:08,000
getting incentives it did work exactly

1472
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,359
this way

1473
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,200
and in i.t

1474
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,480
world and again that's my area

1475
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,880
of the experience so like india did a

1476
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,960
good great job and there are huge

1477
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,160
innovation industry in india because for

1478
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,079
30 years they were building this through

1479
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,520
very simple initially jobs and then

1480
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,680
accumulated enough experience to create

1481
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,880
some type of capital market structure

1482
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,280
and innovation structure while they

1483
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,599
still have image like

1484
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:40,559
low low

1485
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,799
low-level koreans there is good portion

1486
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,280
of this the size of many countries which

1487
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,000
is really innovative driven

1488
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,480
so if that would be put

1489
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,799
for this type of goal so we will be part

1490
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,359
of the beneficial as well

1491
00:57:55,359 --> 00:57:57,680
but return should be much bigger and i

1492
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,599
think in all countries where we were

1493
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,359
using this return was very good for the

1494
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:02,559
countries

1495
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,079
thank you so much and willie you have

1496
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,559
the last word

1497
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,079
a couple of remarks very briefly

1498
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,400
one of the issues

1499
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,400
that europe and specifically also this

1500
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,400
region is facing that we are doing not

1501
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,520
so bad anymore on the vc side that means

1502
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,760
the venture capital market is developing

1503
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,000
in the right direction

1504
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,920
the gap is now existing on the private

1505
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,400
equities to finance scaling and growing

1506
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,640
companies and if this is not close this

1507
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,640
gap these companies will leave this

1508
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,839
region and therefore we lose jobs

1509
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,000
and this is the reason why i think this

1510
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,559
critical mass for a capital market is

1511
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,040
needed in this region to really attract

1512
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,599
private investors to go into this type

1513
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:47,760
of of investment to keep innovation and

1514
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,200
keep companies and keep jobs there

1515
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,480
second

1516
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,920
i'm absolutely absolutely skeptical or

1517
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,359
not skeptical i'm

1518
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,240
i'm i'm extremely scared if and when we

1519
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,559
start the discussion fighting public and

1520
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:04,559
fighting private

1521
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:07,520
it's way more about blending public and

1522
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,799
private

1523
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:10,720
what happened and i've just made one

1524
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,880
sentence what i have done the last five

1525
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,400
years

1526
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,880
we were using public money to offer a

1527
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,640
guarantee

1528
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,040
attracting five i would the the

1529
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,760
guarantee was 30 billion

1530
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,119
and we incentivized 500 billion

1531
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,640
investment

1532
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,240
via eab where i was working for and the

1533
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,040
difference between the 30 and the 500 is

1534
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,400
private money

1535
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,319
and what was the result

1536
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:41,280
why the guarantee we had a clear policy

1537
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,720
target and via private money we had the

1538
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,880
highest level of efficiency because the

1539
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,079
money is

1540
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,040
to be paid back it's not the grant it's

1541
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,520
financing and the private sector gives

1542
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,079
exactly the right incentives creating a

1543
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,559
critical must and giving the right

1544
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,720
incentive third

1545
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,319
and i'm also scared about uh listening

1546
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:06,319
to the the artificial

1547
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:07,599
let's say

1548
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,000
dividing world between cooperation and

1549
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,359
competition

1550
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,760
i give you just one example last week in

1551
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,760
vienna we had a wonderful conference on

1552
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,960
autonomous driving 170 global companies

1553
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,280
were sitting around in there

1554
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,079
and they have created a new word

1555
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,599
and that's called co-op petition

1556
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,520
we need competition but we need

1557
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:34,480
cooperation at the same time and i think

1558
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:35,680
this new

1559
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,520
this this this i love the word

1560
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,200
co-petition

1561
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,960
because this really brings us forward

1562
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,119
not to fight each other but to put the

1563
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,680
forces together and last but not least

1564
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,680
i find this is

1565
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,000
a classical example globesec as its best

1566
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,240
to offer exactly this platform of

1567
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,640
discussion between public and private

1568
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,599
sector to bring both of us a step a step

1569
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,359
further

1570
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:03,040
thank you so much willie thank you so

1571

much to all the speakers and all the

1572
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,599
participants for the fantastic panel we

1573
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,240
learned new words competition we had

1574
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,040
some arguments about the matter of size

1575
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,119
how much is good and how much is not

1576
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:16,960
good and in which areas we all agree

1577
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,880
that education and investing into

1578
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,359
talents is the key and priority for

1579
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,480
everybody

1580
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,319
