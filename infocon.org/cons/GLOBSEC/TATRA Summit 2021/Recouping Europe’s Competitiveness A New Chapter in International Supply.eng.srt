1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,800
so things are going to take even longer

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,760
than

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,480
otherwise would have taken so

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,240
i think we are not seeing the onshoring

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,639
i think it's just the beginning but

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,160
i think things are going to get worse

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
supply issues are going to

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,839
dominate

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,199
the next decade because uh you know

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,600
we've got a bit schizophrenic we want to

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,279
be local but we don't want to quite give

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,519
up being global i think the gentleman

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,439
from bmw andrea so i don't know if he's

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,679
here he said the sentence of the day for

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,558
me he said catl is chinese but they're

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,120
willing to put a factory in germany to

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,920
make batteries for bmw and bmw makes its

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,160
cars in china so you know you can't

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
say better than that it's very difficult

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,719
to europeanize

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,360
so quickly it's going to take time that

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,559
it will take time but do you see it

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,399
happening eventually eventually

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,320
eventually it will happen because the

25
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,120
rules of origin will dictate how people

26
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,879
are going to live

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,399
how we're going to live in the future

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,160
what is the future of

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,840
mankind because

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,920
you know we haven't done anything really

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
for climate change temperatures are

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,720
rising carbon levels you know emission

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,159
levels are rising so we have to do

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,400
something and we will i think we will

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
things will change we'll sort of

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,119
change the way we move mobility will

37
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,960
change more towards public

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,320
transportation

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,040
and you know cars and scooters and last

40
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,400
mile and jobs we know we need jobs and i

41
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,280
think the supply chain will create jobs

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
and industry and technology will create

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,920
jobs and the next generation will

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
dictate how we live

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,119
and and it's interesting that you say

46
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,479
with this new supply chain we're going

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,079
to see perhaps in your drop creation but

48
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,600
a lot of this new supply chain will be

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,399
based on uh potentially robotics and

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,640
machines that are going to be doing the

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
jobs that usually people do so i wonder

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,920
actually do you see that happening you

53
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,840
know a supply chain that is profitable

54
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,840
that sees growth but actually also sees

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,200
employment because i guess that's where

56
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,360
the tension is too

57
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,840
that's for me yeah yeah of course we see

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,240
we saw it even even before but what is

59
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
now reality is that this process was

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
just speeded up but uh speaking about

61
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,480
about supply chain and and shortage

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,760
economy now the the fresh uh issue of

63
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,319
the economist the cover page is the

64
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,920
shortage economy

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,680
elder from us who lived here in this

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,879
region we

67
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,879
we know what does it mean uh strategic

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,000
economy

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
now i don't see i don't think it is the

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
same of course

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
i i think that this is temporary i mean

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
this today's situation of course if we

73
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
are speaking about what does it mean

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,879
temporary if it is

75
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,680
months or or years but i think in

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
principle it is temporary

77
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,599
but if you are speaking about the

78
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,239
main topic of this this panel

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,160
which is competitiveness competitiveness

80
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
of europe competitiveness of

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
uh central european uh central central

82
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,480
eastern european region in particular

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
i think very very important is speaking

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,159
about these global trends which are

85
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,720
everywhere which are as as you said it

86
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,400
is now very difficult to say which

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
companies chinese american and so on so

88
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,920
on but there are some some some global

89
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
challenges which are clear and which

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
will influence very significantly future

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,360
of competence of the different parts of

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
the world i think there are there are

93
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
few which will be the most important

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,840
first one will be ecology of course we

95
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,959
need to restructure our economic models

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
and it will have significant economic

97
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,959
consequences for different parts of the

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,799
world second one is geopolitical rivalry

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,879
it is it is another important point

100
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,239
because it will be not only economic

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,239
conditions or economic factors which

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,560
will influence the competitiveness but

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
also politics in this regard especially

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
between rivalry between uh western world

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
usa especially and china on the other

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
side then it is demographic because we

107
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,239
have very different development in

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,560
demography in different parts of of

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
europe and then finally it is also the

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
model of economy which we have all over

111
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,519
the world it is which is that

112
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,760
debt-driven growth which means you have

113
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,319
very very quickly growing around that

114
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,478
and what we see now don't want to speak

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,600
uh

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,639
to to too much but what we see now

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,280
is that europe has problem just just

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
speaking about economic

119
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
economic factors during the last 10

120
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,639
years

121
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,440
if you are speaking about usa

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
europe and china

123
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
we see that usa it has the biggest the

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,479
the best economic performance

125
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,720
uh just just look at the at the share of

126
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,400
global global gdp which is still 25

127
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,720
share of global gdp of of europe is

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,960
going down china has very serious

129
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,919
problems now which means what i i

130
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,840
think is one of the biggest problems is

131
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,160
and of course u.s usa has its own

132
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,520
problems especially political but

133
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,120
speaking about

134
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
about economic competitiveness i think

135
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,440
the biggest problem of europe

136
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,080
is the lack of creative destruction

137
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
legal flexible economic economic

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,120
conditions which are stimulating the

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
qualitative changes which are

140
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
stimulating these new very demanding

141
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,479
conditions which are creating really new

142
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,039
environment and europe in this regard is

143
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,440
is lagging behind

144
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
and specifically central institute or

145
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
maybe we will speak later about about

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,440
this situation yeah and you know on that

147
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,280
point before how do you uh you know you

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,800
you made a good point that i always find

149
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
uh interesting you know the dynamics in

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
the united states are of course

151
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,759
different to europe because well it's a

152
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,280
very self-sufficient country and that's

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,479
where the administration is working out

154
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,400
to be but it also is about the

155
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,000
innovation you know if you look at the

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,360
big listed companies in the united

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,240
states through the future of industries

158
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
companies you know it's your airbnb it's

159
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
your social media and it's everything

160
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,039
around it if you look at the list of

161
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,360
companies in europe it really is a 20th

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,479
century companies you know it's the

163
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,400
pharmaceuticals it's the car makers and

164
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,919
and so on you know it still looks very

165
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,720
old is that because in europe there is

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
still a risk aversion that you don't get

167
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,880
in the in the united states or perhaps

168
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
in the more anglo countries or does it

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,759
have to be with the kind of leveling up

170
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,440
and scaling up that you need a lot of

171
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,199
the companies that i speak to say the

172
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,039
problem that we have is that in europe

173
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,960
when you do the investor round it's very

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,479
very hard to get access to the cash in

175
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,919
the united states you do two rounds and

176
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,080
you've raised the cash yeah so really

177
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,000
where well many companies will tell you

178
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
in the united states you do your invest

179
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,840
around with a good uh

180
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,360
pitch and you get your money i mean look

181
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,520
at the companies over the past 10 years

182
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
namely one innovation in europe look at

183
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,440
the once the united states the ratio is

184
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,199
probably one to ten

185
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,759
so what's so why is that happening not

186
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,280
here it's very complex phenomena of

187
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,759
course it has his historical reasons

188
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,639
different

189
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,479
and we don't have in reality single

190
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,479
market in europe still yeah which means

191
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,000
flexibility of the market is different

192
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,560
but also historically it is it is it is

193
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,800
very different and yes i agree and then

194
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,759
if you look at the europe inside we see

195
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,680
then very big difference in the north

196
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,560
and and and so but even nordic countries

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,000
which are considered as without problems

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,840
have problems if you look at the germany

199
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,319
today after 16 years of very successful

200
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,599
very stable government of mrs merkel we

201
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,840
see that they've been missing necessary

202
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,720
reforms and answer is in flexibility and

203
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,639
reforms because

204
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,400
outside development is changing every

205
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
day and now after pandemic this it is

206
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,120
changing even quicker than it was before

207
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,000
and if your system is rigid it is not

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,400
flexible enough to react on this

209
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
to for me the the best explanation is

210
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,560
the schumpeter's create creative

211
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,880
distraction you need you need to have

212
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,120
very flexible system which is very

213
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,599
flexibly reacting on the new demand on

214
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,520
the on the new possibilities on the new

215
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,440
threats which are connected with this

216
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
and this is the problem of of europe

217
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,919
and just to the final round of questions

218
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,960
of course let's talk about the

219
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
geopolitics when you look at the supply

220
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,680
story

221
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
this is of course very much a political

222
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,280
story in many ways too how much of an

223
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,199
impact does the current geopolitics that

224
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,800
we're seeing you know there's still huge

225
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
trade tensions happening in the world

226
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,599
feed into this conversation yeah i react

227
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,639
to what tara said right i mean we are

228
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,840
global

229
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,919
company i mean we in robotics for

230
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,360
instance we have three factories one in

231
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,840
europe one in china one u.s

232
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,319
and uh of course i mean uh what what is

233
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,080
happening now is impacting all three of

234
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
them right

235
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,639
and

236
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,879
what you said it will impact next year's

237
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,399
use a decade

238
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,320
i think we will learn quickly what to do

239
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,799
with that because with this

240
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,360
microchip shortage not only microchip

241
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
but the microchip has started probably

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
uh atleast

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
we now have see the solution

244
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
i mean if the one microchip which was

245
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,000
priced two thousand dollars per hundred

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,200
pieces is now sixty thousand dollars

247
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,720
what shall you do

248
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,600
so immediately in order to to complete

249
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,920
certain like big lines for 20 million

250
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,680
euros then you have to talk to the

251
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,839
customer said are you willing to buy

252
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,279
pay spot price

253
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,040
and this is this is the learning and it

254
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
will come and it will be new standard

255
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,959
because we will be able we will be able

256
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,200
to to cope with that because then you

257
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,040
prioritize right

258
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,399
um

259
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,560
what you said about the competitiveness

260
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,440
so for me this is a relatively easy fix

261
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
of course there will be shortage it will

262
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,399
have impact i mean there will be

263
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,480
projects delayed but what you said about

264
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
the shortage of labor as well i mean we

265
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,880
as a robotics company we always

266
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,200
accuse that we are taking work from from

267
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
people and still the unemployment is on

268
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,440
record high level right with increased

269
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
automation but what we should start

270
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,279
talking about is risk killing of though

271
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,200
of the people and this is actually where

272
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,040
we at least in central europe have

273
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,560
really big

274
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,839
gap to do

275
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,440
because

276
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,399
the the

277
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,120
the labor is extremely mobile today

278
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,279
especially with pandemic that is fast

279
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,240
and

280
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,920
the process much

281
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,240
much quicker than expected i mean if you

282
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,680
are an i.t guy

283
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,519
it doesn't matter if you are working in

284
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
bratislava or sri lanka no one really

285
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,000
cares

286
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,399
i mean discussion about innovate i mean

287
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,240
what is the ratio of people employing

288
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,079
slovakia and other three continents

289
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,720
right i mean you are very flexible and

290
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,440
this is actually in future manufacturing

291
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,480
company

292
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,760
right

293
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
the capital the the human capital is

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,760
extremely mobile today

295
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,120
and and we should actually make sure

296
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,320
that uh we get the best for european

297
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,880
interest because if i see the

298
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,720
people dealing with

299
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,160
artificial intelligence and cyber

300
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,240
security there is a

301
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,320
great community of people in slovakia

302
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,000
that is working for asian companies

303
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
they are living here they are spending

304
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,240
money and they they are taxing them but

305
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,560
the know-how and the added value is used

306
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,440
in taiwan china japan it's pretty sad

307
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,880
do you want to i feel like you wanted to

308
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
uh yeah i mean i've worked all over the

309
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,920
world

310
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,240
mostly in emerging markets right

311
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,040
and

312
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,920
people are immensely resilient i mean we

313
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
say the british we the british love

314
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,079
queuing up shortage economy we love

315
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,240
cueing so we're all queuing for petrol

316
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,839
and then you know something else becomes

317
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,760
short everyone's queuing it's a form of

318
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,399
distraction for mankind you know you say

319
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,200
you're too busy sourcing what is short

320
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
to worry about real problems because you

321
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,760
said it there are very few leaders at

322
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,959
the moment mrs merkel was stability for

323
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,360
germany who do you look up to as

324
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,680
government and another gentleman said

325
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,120
something very good today when

326
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
politicians start choosing technology we

327
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,519
really need to worry so

328
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,399
i think

329
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,640
you mentioned in about it's only a year

330
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,200
that i've started working in this region

331
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,920
wonderful region immensely capable but i

332
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,279
have to say

333
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,320
that i find it amazing at how little

334
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,040
support innovation gets here

335
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
yes you know if you're innovative here

336
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,040
you're actually penalized i'm very

337
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
surprised

338
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,440
you know it's like what

339
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,519
you know you should be really really

340
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,760
nurturing this innovation this all the

341
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,519
ideas you know ai robotics

342
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,360
battery value chains all the great

343
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,279
things that are happening here but i see

344
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,760
them fighting for basics yeah you know

345
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,519
getting attention you said in the us you

346
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,200
do a couple of rounds and you get your

347
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
funding right i have never seen people

348
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,800
work so hard to get funding that should

349
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,279
come to them naturally in the central

350
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
and eastern european countries and this

351
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
morning they were talking about

352
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,120
uh it's too expensive

353
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,880
because

354
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,360
you go and buy second-hand german diesel

355
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,560
and gasoline cars and bring them here

356
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
therefore you have the worst co2 level

357
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,079
you're number two in terms of that so

358
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:51,760
i'm worrying about that you know you

359
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
have to maybe bring some change here

360
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
because

361
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,240
otherwise

362
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
climate change will take the decisions

363
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,639
for us you know for 25 years we've heard

364
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,200
650 million people have no access to

365
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,839
electricity 25 years we've been talking

366
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,240
about it and now it's 700 million people

367
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
so we're not solving the problems that

368
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,200
well are we

369
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
but tara would you say just just to rub

370
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
on this uh point that you make uh about

371
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,800
perhaps a lack of innovation in eastern

372
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,560
central europe i know it's it's very

373
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,200
hard

374
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
there's plenty of innovation lack of

375
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
support to okay of support

376
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,360
is that because you feel like it's still

377
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,720
very much ingrained and again i don't

378
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,000
want to be rude but this is something

379
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,760
that you know behind the scenes many

380
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,959
governments in eastern europe still

381
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,720
continue to tell you in central europe

382
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,639
that would they see their big advantages

383
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,560
on the price is competing on this

384
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,000
exactly is that because you are

385
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,160
absolutely right the decider of all of

386
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,440
them

387
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
is cheapness yeah we want things to be

388
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,639
cheap

389
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,959
and if things to be cheap requires

390
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,240
subsidy then we need

391
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
institutionalization as you said

392
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
disruption positive disruption

393
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
and free freedom of choice should be

394
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,240
given to the consumer and the consumer

395
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,720
should elect to spend that money i was

396
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,399
saying this morning that

397
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
mobile phones are a very good example of

398
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,440
how it evolved right because if you look

399
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,399
at haiti the poorest nation on earth per

400
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
capita there are more mobile phones in

401
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,680
haiti than there are in the united

402
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,720
states because people choose not to eat

403
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
to buy that phone right

404
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,760
so

405
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,320
somehow we have to translate that desire

406
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
of the consumer to have the best

407
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,399
into the support from the eu and nations

408
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
to make it happen you use the example of

409
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,120
innovate i didn't but i see them

410
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,959
struggle

411
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,600
you know they struggle and

412
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
some of the big ideas that came from

413
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,399
this region you know cradle to cradle

414
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,680
recycling making sure that you know

415
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,320
energy neutral processes and businesses

416
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,240
all of those things are innovations but

417
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,800
they're not getting airtime

418
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,399
and this is a very good point you know

419
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,839
because it does show that there's a lag

420
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,920
and a mismatch perhaps between where

421
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
government action is going and to some

422
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,839
extent where your consumer also wants to

423
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,839
wants to see so how can you narrow that

424
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
gap yeah i think specific problem of

425
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,560
this region i mean ce region is that

426
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,120
in first stage of reforms we have been

427
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,279
we have been creating the basis for

428
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,920
market economy it was kind of will to do

429
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,839
to change this because communism

430
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,199
collapsed and everything everybody

431
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,399
wanted to be very to do it very very

432
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,040
strong kind of kind of support for this

433
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,440
was eu integration because it was for us

434
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,639
as motivation as as banker also

435
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,399
now you know these countries entered to

436
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,000
european you know some of them also to

437
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,199
eurozone

438
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:35,920
they

439
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,519
increased mass industrial

440
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,440
competitiveness and is the key we are

441
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,519
very calm still competitive in mass

442
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,199
industrial production

443
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,519
problem is that it was based on the

444
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,399
skills also but also in the low salaries

445
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,240
but they are losing this competitiveness

446
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,440
of course because we are growing

447
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,800
economies growing growth ages are

448
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,839
growing and we are not doing enough uh

449
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,079
for restructuring from mass industrial

450
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,199
production

451
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,000
to

452
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
innovation-driven economy but the

453
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,120
problem is

454
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,199
that first it is kind of lack of

455
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,360
incentives for for politicians to do

456
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,399
this because

457
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,959
you know every reform is is politically

458
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,120
difficult it's political challenge and

459
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,079
now it is not kind of necessity and i

460
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,399
mean visible necessity it is necessity

461
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,079
of course but people don't consider even

462
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,480
politicians don't consider this and then

463
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,880
if you don't have this kind of consensus

464
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,000
among significant part of population and

465
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,399
politicians that it is that reforms have

466
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,720
to be permanent process not campaign we

467
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
are doing two three years reforms and

468
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,800
then nothing other than we are great and

469
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,839
i see few countries which which are

470
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,839
relatively successful in this estonia is

471
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,000
good example every small tiny country

472
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
which which has this kind of consensus

473
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,480
among politicians that okay

474
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,079
despite if this central right center

475
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,120
left governments they agreed that they

476
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
want and they need to

477
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,279
modernize the country permanently and

478
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,279
this is something which is missing

479
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,720
especially if i'm speaking about my

480
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,519
country slovakia maybe we are at least

481
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,679
in in visage for the worst example or

482
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,119
one of the worst examples because we

483
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,079
have kind of periods of very very very

484
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,240
speed reforms and then doing nothing and

485
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,199
then so and then then as is more you are

486
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,720
you are delaying necessary forms as more

487
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
difficult politically it is to do

488
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,119
because then price and and so on which

489
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,959
means but this is general problem not

490
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,959
only in central eastern europe i mean in

491
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,160
all europe

492
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,400
because because this process of

493
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
necessary modernization saying in other

494
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,320
words doing reforms are very very

495
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,760
important and politically risky and

496
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,600
politically difficult and you know just

497
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,120
a follow-up on that you know perhaps a

498
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,880
controversial question maybe i get a lot

499
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,600
of uh hate for asking this

500
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,280
and knowing that of course eastern

501
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
central europe is is very the politics

502
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,640
it's very hard to kind of reduce them to

503
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,160
a stereotype but i have to ask you this

504
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,760
question given that you mentioned eu

505
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,600
integration you also mentioned uh the

506
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,440
politics how they feed into the economy

507
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,840
what about rule of law and in the past

508
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,520
year we've seen a lot of money that kind

509
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,640
of goes

510
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,559
you know what i like eastern europe is

511
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,000
cheap is good for my business but i'm

512
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,320
not sure if i like the liberal term that

513
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,840
some people are taking

514
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,679
how big of a risk is that this is my

515
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,799
favorite question first

516
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,559
this is very difficult because uh

517
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,280
friction and legacy you mean not only

518
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,360
formal rules but informal rules are

519
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,000
changing very very slowly through the

520
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
ink change of generation gordon brown

521
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
said i very agree with him that

522
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,280
regarding rule of law first 400 years is

523
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,559
the most difficult

524
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,080
and this is of course a legacy i mean

525
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,600
historical legacy not only from

526
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,320
communist 40 years in this region of 70

527
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,280
in ukraine and russia is is really

528
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,919
really very difficult and this friction

529
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,240
and this this reproduction of the

530
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
informal rules and deformations in the

531
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,080
informal rules are huge which means it

532
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,039
is fight it is it is it is it it will be

533
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,039
improved and it is improving i have to

534
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,000
say

535
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,160
but but unfortunately very slowly very

536
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,640
costly it is one of the reason why

537
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,360
reforms are even more difficult maybe in

538
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,600
in this region i spent five years in

539
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,760
ukraine it is even more difficult it is

540
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
it is you know it's extraordinary on one

541
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,480
side they have really i.t sector very

542
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,880
developed very competitive on other side

543
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,640
they didn't do this industrial

544
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,400
competitiveness reform restructuring of

545
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,559
the old industry was not done which

546
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,240
means you have some kind of contrast in

547
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,960
this that it is it is objectively

548
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,440
difficult and it is simply impossible to

549
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,360
change in few in a few years but it is

550
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
necessary fight and push

551
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,440
and do you see to that extent of course

552
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,880
this week it's been very much in the

553
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,240
news in particular in one country but

554
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,360
i'm not going to

555
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
name and shame anyone but but do you see

556
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,200
this tension at times between

557
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,640
kind of the national dynamics that

558
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,559
happen in some countries and and then

559
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,240
the rules also emanating from brussels

560
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,679
and and it's very important to ask this

561
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,799
question because a lot of the industrial

562
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,559
policy is going to be guided by brussels

563
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,640
going forward do you see that tension

564
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,960
removing momentum in the economy

565
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
uh you mean tensions between uh brussels

566
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
and nationals so the industrial policy

567
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,440
perhaps that comes

568
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
and also the money perhaps also coming

569
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,720
from brussels with strings attached on

570
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
rule of law there is there is of course

571
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,760
some some tension but i am strong

572
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,320
deeply convinced that the the european

573
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
union membership for countries like

574
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,159
slovakia and czech republic is the

575
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,960
biggest fortune what they had without

576
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,200
this it could be much much much worse of

577
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,760
course eu has its own some problems and

578
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,000
but in but in principle

579
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
you you rules and you not only

580
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,720
regulation but also fight for uh level

581
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,960
playing uh for instance for for anti

582
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,000
anti uh monopoly policy and so on for

583
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,320
for responsible public finance for

584
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,240
instance is is very very important which

585
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,960
means i think it is grateful it is it is

586
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,360
very positive that that there is this

587
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,000
tension because it is finally speeding

588
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,039
up this necessary development uh

589
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,760
to to normally functioning uh i mean

590
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,200
country with the rule of law and

591
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,280
everything this and is that being passed

592
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,799
through to the citizens i wonder if you

593
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,520
want to add she comes from the uk

594
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,240
i wonder if how much because i i fully

595
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
agree but it's not enough at least from

596
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,919
my industrial perspective is this not

597
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,360
not enough and what you mention here

598
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,039
also is

599
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,240
i mean

600
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,600
we are lacking uh certain

601
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,840
things like basic things like education

602
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,760
here in slovakia right i mean how many

603
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,320
universities we have forty six

604
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
for five black people

605
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,720
and uh basically say something about the

606
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,039
quality as well

607
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,600
and if i if i look at the

608
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,559
needs of the industry right

609
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,039
i mean from this cheap labor we are

610
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,799
coming even slovakia to higher debt

611
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,640
value

612
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,440
but

613
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,080
we don't have the skills yeah and this

614
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
is not really something you can fix in

615
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,120
five years yeah

616
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,159
and

617
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,159
i mean if you look at the government

618
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,679
current government we are just in the

619
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,159
middle of the of the time right

620
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,559
so what he did uh regarding this the uh

621
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,880
the educational reform so final thing

622
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,320
hopefully there is actually something in

623
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,960
pipeline kindergartens let's say

624
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,440
we have to start that anyway right

625
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,960
but uh

626
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
i mean we really have a long way to go

627
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,960
and the the industry the population in

628
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,720
slovakia is three million five five

629
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
point four five point four million yeah

630
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,080
but

631
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,679
i mean the industry is actually very

632
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,919
flexible in terms of mobility

633
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,400
right unfortunately there is

634
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
so far no better option

635
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,320
but what we see in for instance in in

636
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,799
serbia serbia is actually attracting a

637
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,720
lot of industries by subsidizing

638
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,440
providing land and so on i mean we see

639
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,360
bulgaria is having

640
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,600
exactly the same problems in slovakia

641
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,799
lack of educated educated people in

642
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,880
order to provide higher value

643
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,559
so we still have time because there is

644
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,480
no one better at the moment

645
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,280
but the time is the clock is ticking and

646
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,880
i think we should we should really stop

647
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,799
wasting time and do something yeah and

648
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,120
can i ask you to follow up on that point

649
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,720
because

650
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
i see it for myself you know i'm based

651
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,240
in brussels a lot of france colleagues

652
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,679
that are eastern european very clever

653
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,960
very smart you ask them do you want to

654
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,240
go back to your home countries and they

655
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,200
say no so

656
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,120
is that

657
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,799
i mean how can you fix this binary

658
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,120
because again these are super capable

659
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,640
people that add a lot of value to the

660
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,919
economy and then you ask them do you

661
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,520
want to go back and they say no that's

662
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,440
another thing i mean this is my favorite

663
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,400
question i mean may i

664
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,600
because i mean we in slovakia

665
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,720
we lost two generations in 90s

666
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,880
uh university educated people move out

667
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,360
to do the west czech republic and others

668
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,080
but today i mean if i look at my old

669
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,320
alma mater in bernard which is a

670
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,039
technical university 7 000

671
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,640
slovak student

672
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,400
at least one third will never return

673
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,840
back to slovakia one half

674
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,480
you know if i may because this is a very

675
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,799
very important topic

676
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,960
it is not like that that if we will be

677
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,760
when we will be in the future reach then

678
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,919
they will return no no if they will feel

679
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,320
that it has perspective to return

680
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,080
because if you have dynamic economy

681
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,000
which is growing six seven percent is

682
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,880
very dynamic then it is creating better

683
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,720
opportunities for young educated people

684
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,880
than rich country which is growing two

685
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,799
percent for instance which means what is

686
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,120
very important is that people have to

687
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
feel that they have perspective there

688
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,120
and then they will return which means it

689
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,720
is good that a lot of slovakians are

690
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,880
studying abroad but bad is that they are

691
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,679
not returning homes and also bad is that

692
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,600
what czech republic is is doing

693
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,279
regarding slovak republic they are

694
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,200
taking the best students there they're

695
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,799
free of charge studying in slovak

696
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,039
language they do it because it is active

697
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,000
immigration policy and we are not doing

698
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,039
the same

699
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,240
in connection with for instance

700
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,080
ukrainians and others because it is

701
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,159
competition it is fight for the best

702
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,960
brains which means and we had period in

703
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
2002 2006 when slovakia was considered

704
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,360
the most reformed country in the world

705
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,679
and i met those students in prague in

706
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,400
czech slovak students in prague in brno

707
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,960
many of them told me at that time yes we

708
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,799
won't return because slovakia was

709
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,360
considered economic danger very dynamic

710
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,600
very eight percent growth which means it

711
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,679
is also about image and perception of

712
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,840
the perspectiveness but can i also ask

713
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,000
you and again you know i'm going to get

714
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
so much hate for for presenting these

715
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,360
ideas like this but i think it's good to

716
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,840
have the frank discussion there's uh you

717
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
know i hear this a lot also in brussels

718
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,600
particularly eastern europeans will say

719
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,200
you know you see this catch-up so you

720
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,880
see explosive growth of course that's

721
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,840
going to happen when you have a lot of

722
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,000
catch-up to do but perhaps two percent

723
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
growth in germany that's going to pay me

724
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
more good school for my kids good health

725
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,400
care i'd rather stay there is are we

726
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
talking not just about the salary but a

727
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,919
whole ecosystem that needs to be made

728
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,240
more attractive is that and not only it

729
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,960
is also about roots a majority of people

730
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
feel the roots from the place where they

731
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
are they they have been born and so on

732
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,200
which means ireland is the best example

733
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,679
ireland in 60s 70s it was huge

734
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,480
immigration to the us then reforms very

735
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,320
high economy growth prosperity many of

736
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,480
them returned also with experience with

737
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
money and then after after enlargement

738
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,000
of eu they they absorbed a lot of people

739
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,240
from vietnamese they turned this and it

740
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
is it is possible to do because yeah it

741
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,880
is very complex it has many of

742
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,440
dimensions this but in in principle

743
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,240
people if they they feel perspective

744
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,000
majority of them i'm not saying all of

745
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,960
them

746
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,360
in principle wants to to return but i

747
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,039
guess when in the example of ireland in

748
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,559
particular you know what they did was

749
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:33,279
cut taxes major time attract apple and

750
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,039
the tech sector people started getting

751
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,960
paid well and then returned is is that

752
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,320
basically what essentially we were

753
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,919
saying perhaps that you need big names

754
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,360
transferring here

755
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,120
you know now it is it is they have big

756
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
names because it's like a land rover

757
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,120
yeah and

758
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,640
but you see what i mean you know

759
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,080
with the irish store it's very

760
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
particular on on the taxation you know

761
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,159
that's that's how they were able to flip

762
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,240
it and and and some countries will tell

763
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,760
you in a way that

764
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,320
it perhaps was very competitive for them

765
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,080
but wasn't good for the european union

766
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,400
overall so you know this is more

767
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,240
difficult question it is another my

768
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,480
topic my favorite topic because we did

769
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,400
uh tax reform one of the reform which we

770
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
did was tax reform and we have been

771
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
accused at that time that it is tax

772
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,600
dumping and unfair tax competition but

773
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,279
that's simply not true i didn't want to

774
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,320
use a word but you didn't

775
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,720
than before we just restructured the the

776
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
taxes we can't throw some taxes we

777
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
reduce some direct taxes but we increase

778
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,080
some undirect taxes and finally finally

779
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,720
the tax we didn't have a lack of money

780
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,799
which we covered from the structure of

781
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,880
european funds no on the contrary we had

782
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,039
more money from taxes because economy

783
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,880
was growing and we collected more money

784
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
and finally if you are growing quicker

785
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,200
you are shorter time in position of net

786
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
receiver of the european money it is

787
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,760
more complex fundament is not just look

788
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,600
at the rates in the

789
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,559
another example we had 19 of of

790
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,120
corporate tax rate at that time germany

791
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,960
had 38

792
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,080
average uh profit tax rate but we

793
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,399
collected much more from this tax than

794
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,360
germany collected because nominal rate

795
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,279
is only part of the story another part

796
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,760
of story is tax base and exceptions

797
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,080
deductions and so on which means finally

798
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,360
our 19

799
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,840
corporate tax rate was bigger

800
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,799
than germany's 38 which means this

801
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,240
sometimes sometimes it's a very

802
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,720
simplified thing the the discussion on

803
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,279
this and can i ask you just to also wrap

804
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,360
up on this conversation of you know

805
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,039
brain drain or attacking attracting

806
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,039
talent of course you work here in this

807
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,240
region but you're also based in the

808
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,000
united kingdom it does seem that the

809
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
debate in terms of what's talent what's

810
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,559
high added value worker to the economies

811
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,720
is very different and changing very fast

812
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,399
how do you see it what's to you a high

813
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,799
added value uh worker so brain drain is

814
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,279
nothing new it's been there forever and

815
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,120
it's part of the supply chain human

816
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,679
capital is part of the you know supply

817
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,600
chain uh and

818
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,840
i think

819
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,399
that

820
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,080
we've you you quoted gordon brown but uh

821
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,960
you know

822
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,159
it's actually

823
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
the problem with mankind is we have

824
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,640
amnesia we don't look at history we

825
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,039
forget about past lessons and we repeat

826
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,440
our mistakes over and over again that's

827
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,240
the problem so uh you know tax

828
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,480
incentives and tax reforms don't build

829
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,640
economies because you give them a

830
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,960
10-year tax break they come for 10 years

831
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
then they up roots and go somewhere else

832
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,039
where do you get a bigger tax incentive

833
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,120
package it's about the ecosystem

834
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,840
creating the right ecosystem for people

835
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,320
to put down roots this is this is the

836
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,640
words that you use and that's exactly

837
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,600
right how do you entice people to put

838
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,760
down roots somewhere and if you notice

839
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,240
countries that are subjected to

840
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,880
sanctions typically do well

841
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,200
because people come together people come

842
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,919
together they become united and they get

843
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,399
of common purpose and countries that are

844
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,440
thrown money at eu funding sometimes

845
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
don't even know how to spend that money

846
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,039
they can't spend that money because they

847
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,720
don't know what to do with it because

848
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,600
they are clogged with bureaucracy

849
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,640
the issue of serbia doing better is

850
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,279
because they tackled bureaucracy they

851
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,080
set up a notion of one-stop shop to

852
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,919
attract investment

853
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,799
and here i find in this region

854
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,440
especially in what i've experienced the

855
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,320
bureaucracy and the gentleman's club

856
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
i mean the women are very subservient

857
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,919
here i don't know why

858
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,120
i mean very very very capable women very

859
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,159
you know

860
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,399
on top of the world but very subservient

861
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,720
they i don't i find that very strange

862
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,480
because i think if there were more women

863
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,640
in positions of power they know how to

864
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
fix things because you do that

865
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,880
yeah and and there's what i i hope that

866
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
the woman here do you have something to

867
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
say about this i mean yeah where are the

868
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,799
women

869
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,760
yeah like

870
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,279
but how can you hear you know like women

871
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,039
in eastern europe are very

872
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,360
kind of submissive and i mean i'm sure

873
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,320
you have a a reaction to that

874
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,080
we have moldova now which has uh

875
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,600
president and prime minister and you

876
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,679
have a president uh but that sometimes

877
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:08,960
is different because you know what you

878
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,480
see is that women who make it to the top

879
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,159
may not be reflective of what you see in

880
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:13,919
the in the average you know neighborhood

881
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,919
with respect with respect i find a lot

882
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,080
of those things symbolic because the

883
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,240
women who have made it into politics and

884
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,440
outside finland and other places as well

885
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,760
they stay neutral when it comes to

886
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,519
choice of technology or choice of

887
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,600
industry or whatever they don't support

888
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,919
one faction against the other i think we

889
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,640
need a bit more free enterprise and less

890
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,880
bureaucracy from government

891
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,760
if we allow the commerce and industry

892
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,080
and will of the people and the consumer

893
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,320
to dictate a little bit more then

894
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,880
pricing wouldn't become such a big issue

895
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
cheap cars for everybody isn't the way

896
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,880
to go

897
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,039
it's good to have mass transport

898
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,159
mobility and leisure cars maybe it's

899
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,919
that's a different way of lifestyle i

900
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:58,960
mean

901
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,480
climate change will dictate our

902
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,399
lifestyle whether we want it or not

903
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,640
because you should see the floods in

904
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,240
africa you should see the temperature

905
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,039
rises it is real and we're ignoring

906
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,880
people were arguing today about

907
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,159
extending the gasoline ban to 2050 like

908
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,480
it's a choice we have like we can

909
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,559
dictate at what date we turn the trap

910
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,799
off nobody's taking it really seriously

911
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,279
cop 26 is round the corner did anybody

912
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,440
talk about it

913
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,120
they can't even attract the right

914
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,279
attention to the right numbers

915
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,919
so i think we need a few more women in

916
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,880
positions of actual decision making when

917
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,799
it comes to spending money and when it

918
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,880
comes to creating jobs you said the

919
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,200
right thing tell the consumer that this

920
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,519
chip is going to cost 10 times more than

921
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,120
it did two years ago do you watch it or

922
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,880
not right

923
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,559
yeah and what tara says about you know

924
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,880
the female workforce is just so

925
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,799
important come on these guys are now

926
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,000
much smarter you know they don't know

927
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,399
much more than women do like how do you

928
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,159
get cold things i mean i'm old enough

929
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,399
not to care what i'm called pushy

930
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,440
uh ball breaker battle axe what was the

931
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,679
other one god she's gonna kill you

932
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,760
before she lets you out of this room you

933
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,919
have to get used to that you know but i

934
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,159
think the results will speak for itself

935
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,720
and this this region has the most

936
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,039
opportunity in europe look at the

937
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,760
demographics look at the age you know

938
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,080
the young we have to look at the young

939
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,240
the proportion of the young and i think

940
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,080
that's where your opportunity is to

941
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,559
support your new industries and your new

942
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,080
technologies

943
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
and and it brings i mean look at japan

944
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,039
you know when they finally started

945
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,200
taking women seriously and someone had a

946
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,760
yeah well

947
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
thank you very much anthony tony blair

948
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,120
institute i live in london i'm one of

949
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,600
those slovaks who left when i was 18 to

950
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,000
study in the united kingdom i did my

951
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,320
whole university education my

952
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,720
undergraduate master's phd in the uk

953
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,240
i've been away for

954
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,919
more than 10 years now

955
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,000
the problem is serious about drain

956
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,960
brain

957
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
brain debt

958
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,600
and i think there is

959
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,239
i think what matters in the end is the

960
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,079
quality of opportunities for people to

961
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,159
come back to i think that is the single

962
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,918
most important thing

963
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,679
the one positive thing is that it has

964
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,199
been changing in the last couple of

965
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,599
years and i have seen a whole

966
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,040
number of people who spent their 20s

967
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,879
abroad actually gaining a lot of

968
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,399
extremely valuable experience they would

969
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,560
not be able to gain in this region and

970
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,719
then bringing that experience to

971
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,839
the region

972
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,000
slovakia and then being able to set up

973
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,239
their own companies and try to change

974
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,800
things so i think it is not necessarily

975
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,560
a negative things in the grand scheme of

976
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,440
things

977
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
it is about being able to incentivize

978
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,760
people to come back and give them the

979
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,119
quality of opportunities that they are

980
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,280
looking for but the serious point i

981
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,719
wanted to make about the innovation

982
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,599
economy and the transition and the

983
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,199
attempt to overcome the middle income

984
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,839
trap which is a real real economic

985
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,440
threat

986
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,320
is

987
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
that this region has been chronicling

988
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,720
under investing in r d for a long long

989
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,599
time

990
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,280
the average eu 20 spend on r d is around

991
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,680
two percent in slovakia it's no point

992
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,880
eight percent

993
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,680
and that includes public and private r d

994
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,000
and that's just one indication of the

995
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
scale of the problem here

996
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,720
so

997
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,160
i think the biggest problem in this

998
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,440
context really is the lack of

999
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,599
long-term vision and long-term

1000
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,280
commitment that

1001
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,880
leader political leaders really need to

1002
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,400
make in order to overcome these

1003
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,680
challenges

1004
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,880
um

1005
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,119
because to overcome things like middle

1006
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,960
income trap you really need to have

1007
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,119
long-term vision and the institutions

1008
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,359
that are able to safeguard that vision

1009
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:45,280
and at the moment

1010
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,680
all we can see really uh and it's the

1011
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,800
feature of politics in 2020s i suppose

1012
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,720
is is politics driven by very short-term

1013
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,760
interests

1014
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,720
and and a lag of that vision so i think

1015
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,400
i think there is a really serious

1016
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,920
question about how we can institute

1017
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,079
institutionalize that long-termism and

1018
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,520
policy making

1019
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,599
and and how can political leaders

1020
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,280
build strategies that are really

1021
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,880
designed to tackle those long-term

1022
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,359
issues maybe just one addition what you

1023
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,440
said from my side

1024
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
what you also need is not only vision

1025
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,200
and implemented it but you have to have

1026
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,640
consistency

1027
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,720
i mean for instance education i mean you

1028
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,880
cannot do anything in one one term it's

1029
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,800
just four years right

1030
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,560
i mean if we look uh

1031
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,040
we are extremely good in eastern europe

1032
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,440
uh if we have new government they take

1033
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,520
everything out from the predecessor they

1034
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,359
start to build something

1035
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,280
on the

1036
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,720
on the new premises and if i look at the

1037
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,359
asia for instance singapore japan they

1038
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,839
always build on

1039
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,839
and there are certain things where the

1040
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,040
opposition and the governmenting parties

1041
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,079
actually agree we need education

1042
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,920
and it doesn't really matter whether

1043
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,640
elections are won by this or that party

1044
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,359
because they made certain agreements

1045
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,040
that they will continue regardless i

1046
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,119
mean they will modify it slightly but

1047
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,880
not break it down into pieces and start

1048
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,480
again right

1049
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,400
but i fully agree what you said and it's

1050
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,000
great that people are returning but it's

1051
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,320
not massive it's not massive

1052
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,240
i don't see it

1053
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,119
i think this is what i mentioned what i

1054
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,599
had in mind if i mentioned this

1055
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,440
kind of consensus on permanent

1056
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,599
modernization of the country and i think

1057
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,359
this is the most important part of the

1058
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,440
vision because you can create you can

1059
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,280
paint the visions for for there would be

1060
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,599
20 30 years but you don't know but

1061
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,000
problem of this is that yes we have

1062
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,960
really under invested in in and very bad

1063
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,560
quality of high education it's like a

1064
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,200
particularly in in research and but it

1065
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,720
will be not enough this is the problem

1066
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,119
that if even if you will give more money

1067
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,880
even if you will improve

1068
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,040
university quality which is difficult

1069
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,880
and long term it will not be enough

1070
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,680
because

1071
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,359
the the problem is very complex you have

1072
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:00,720
to have

1073
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,440
sound and sustainable public finance you

1074
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,920
have to have improving effective and

1075
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,400
improving

1076
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
public administration public services

1077
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,680
you have to have

1078
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,040
permanently improving business

1079
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
environment and you have to have

1080
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,839
development of knowledge economy

1081
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,200
everything but is connected with this

1082
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,760
only if you are doing progress in all

1083
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,920
these areas you are creating conditions

1084
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,240
for this restructuring permanent from

1085
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,720
mass industrial production to innovative

1086
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,800
economy even for instance if you will

1087
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,119
fulfill this free but you will not have

1088
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,440
high quality of education who will work

1089
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,599
in this innovative economy every

1090
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,359
everybody will leave especially those

1091
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:39,359
the best which means and problem is the

1092
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,359
short-termism in politics is not only

1093
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,960
problem with this region it is problem

1094
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,880
of parliamentary democracy of course

1095
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,200
everywhere now it is even more difficult

1096
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,359
also because social media and everything

1097
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,200
connected with this

1098
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,960
which means yeah it is a really real

1099
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,640
real challenge and

1100
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,520
now we need even more than before strong

1101
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,839
political

1102
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,440
leadership because this short terrorism

1103
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,040
if politicians are doing everything just

1104
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,200
to be the most important priority is to

1105
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,800
be re-elected and then of course we have

1106
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,880
populism we have been that nice we have

1107
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,040
lack of reforms and so on

1108
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,760
and uh actually before i will move to

1109
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,760
perhaps the european uh recovery fund of

1110
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,200
the money is coming in because that's

1111
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,720
that's green and digital terror i want

1112
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,800
to ask you a question uh that i think is

1113
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,240
very fitting for this panel you know

1114
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,880
you're both in the uk but also here uh

1115
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,480
there is no question and you know and i

1116
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,839
lived in the uk and this was a real

1117
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,240
debate that kind of eastern european

1118
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,079
migration or eastern european labor

1119
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,079
force was seen as not the best quality

1120
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,560
for the uk now flash forward 10 years

1121
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,160
you have companies begging the

1122
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,560
government to extend visas and change

1123
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,040
that regulation so first of all isn't

1124
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
that right around heck and then secondly

1125
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,119
uh you know are we wrong in terms of

1126
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,119
measuring how you how you how you add

1127
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,599
value and what high value means i think

1128
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,800
people

1129
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,040
deserve the government they get because

1130
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,720
we the voters

1131
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,959
bring it on ourselves okay and

1132
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,200
in the past the problems were maybe the

1133
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,040
same but the respect for government was

1134
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,119
different there were leaders

1135
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,079
social media has naked made everybody

1136
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,240
naked everybody knows everything about

1137
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,480
everybody if winston churchill lived

1138
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,720
today he would be one of the most hated

1139
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,880
leaders on the planet because everything

1140
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,400
about him and his personal life and

1141
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,319
everything else will be known and people

1142
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:25,920
would never vote him the greatest oh

1143
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,880
he'd be getting on earth for sure

1144
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,560
the statue will fall and everybody will

1145
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,160
jump on his head and all of that stuff

1146
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,920
so we deserve the government we get

1147
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,240
that's point number one point number two

1148
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,200
is that information has turned into

1149
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,000
misinformation so my neighbor

1150
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,680
voted brexit

1151
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,520
my neighbor in my holiday home in the

1152
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,680
middle of england voted brexit because

1153
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,000
she firmly believed we

1154
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,640
were a victim of immigration and syria

1155
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,400
was part of europe that's what she

1156
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,079
thought because all the syrian

1157
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,599
immigrants that were coming to live in

1158
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,440
her area she believed that turkey was

1159
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,240
joining immediately exactly so and then

1160
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,359
my other

1161
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,200
friend was telling me that

1162
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,839
her workers were voted for brexit

1163
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,680
because they believed that eu was

1164
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,240
dictating the shape of vegetables and

1165
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,920
all of these things so misinformation

1166
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,960
leads to a lot of calamities so we need

1167
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,760
accurate proper information secondly i

1168
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,640
do not believe that it's all the role of

1169
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,560
government increasingly we have to

1170
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,599
consider what you said it is

1171
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,319
personal responsibility japanese and

1172
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,760
singaporeans feel personally responsible

1173
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,160
for their uh you know nation and their

1174
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,119
growth and they have you know hundreds

1175
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,839
of years worth of uh

1176
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,680
sort of uh back

1177
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,079
experience to rely on here we keep

1178
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,079
ditching everything we keep ditching

1179
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,240
everything something new and expats with

1180
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,640
respect they all come home to build

1181
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,640
something but they expect a different

1182
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,640
treatment to local people and that

1183
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,000
creates this two-tier society and i

1184
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,079
noticed this at work that there is a

1185
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:04,800
friction between diaspora having come

1186
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,680
home

1187
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,079
and local people who feel they're being

1188
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,200
treated differently and in africa it's

1189
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,319
so

1190
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,000
glaring this issue of expat versus local

1191
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,760
i've always loved that in the uk there

1192
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,839
are no uk migrants they're just british

1193
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,319
expats exactly exactly i've always loved

1194
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,400
that and now i mean my husband is a

1195
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,800
professor at imperial college

1196
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,280
i have had this issue of lack of

1197
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,000
investment in r d since i was 20 years

1198
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,800
old it seems we never invested in r d

1199
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,680
you know this is an old issue so

1200
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,880
i think

1201
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,760
we as individuals and private sector and

1202
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,640
entrepreneurs have to take life into our

1203
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,760
own hands

1204
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,119
it's up to us to basically gather

1205
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,880
together and create a society that is

1206
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,760
just just transition just

1207
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,040
you know fairness men women diversity

1208
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,839
all of that we are it's in our hands you

1209
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:02,880
know

1210
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,440
and the eu to me is an interesting

1211
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,560
concept i mean i am i am a very much

1212
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,040
a remainer and i you know applaud the eu

1213
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,440
and all of that but sometimes you know

1214
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
individual nationalities have to play a

1215
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,160
role yeah it's very difficult if you

1216
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,240
don't see the differences and celebrate

1217
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,920
the differences instead of trying to

1218
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,920
iron away the differences

1219
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,160
and you know going back to to perhaps

1220
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,760
the the comments that we had from the

1221
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,119
audience but of course this question

1222
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,119
about perhaps the uk i remember the

1223
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,079
economist had a front page that said uh

1224
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,640
brexit will trigger now a a kind of

1225
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,599
return

1226
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,440
of uh eastern european minds that have

1227
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,040
been in the united kingdom and go back

1228
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,880
to eastern europe i guess perhaps they

1229
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,160
were referring to more like countries

1230
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,400
like perhaps romania or poland so on but

1231
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,079
to me if i look at that front page and

1232
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,400
what you said and the audience has said

1233
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,079
it seems that that really did not

1234
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,160
materialize this big return and we're

1235
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,839
going to see brexit is going to bring

1236
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,680
the best back home that hap that hasn't

1237
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,920
happened it didn't and what it in fact

1238
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,599
has done if i look at university level

1239
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,560
you know phds and research for what has

1240
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,040
happened is that more common wealth

1241
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,720
people are coming we're getting a lot

1242
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,319
more singaporean chinese indians into

1243
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,040
positions of research but interestingly

1244
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,119
it's not the government or even the

1245
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,040
electorate who made the changes it's

1246
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,200
actually big industry yeah rolls-royce

1247
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,760
choice chose to move to germany yeah

1248
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
right and that took a great deal of

1249
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,079
research uh from the uk

1250
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,160
and if you look at what's happening

1251
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,640
within the car industry you know who

1252
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,599
owns who you get confused isn't it i

1253
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,599
mean uh mini is owned by it's a bmw mini

1254
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,720
is owned by bmw somebody else bought a

1255
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,200
tata motorsport jlr so when you look at

1256
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,680
the ownership of the asset

1257
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,000
and then you map that on where the

1258
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,240
actual commodity is built which is

1259
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,880
slovakia then you come to understand

1260
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,200
like i've done over the past year that

1261
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,920
zero decision making takes place here

1262
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,040
where the cars are made you know that is

1263
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,920
the issue the issue is decision making

1264
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,839
and direction of use of funds batteries

1265
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:14,160
have to be made where the cars are made

1266
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
i mean

1267
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,400
it's like fact of life

1268
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,400
55 of the cost of a vehicle is its

1269
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
battery right

1270
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,800
so batteries should be made where the

1271
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,200
car is made if it makes it more

1272
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,040
expensive that's where the incentive

1273
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,839
should go so what are we getting it's

1274
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,319
the chinese who make the batteries and

1275
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:37,119
it's

1276
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,119
you know talk to the car maker the car

1277
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,359
maker says i need to be competitive on

1278
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,319
cost

1279
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,640
i can't take a risk that my cost will go

1280
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,359
up so what is this circular argument of

1281
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,839
catch-22 so that's where legislation

1282
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,680
should come in legislation should come

1283
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,920
in to say if you make your cars in

1284
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,160
slovakia please make your batteries in

1285
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,599
slovakia

1286
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,599
i mean that's what i think anyway

1287
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,599
and there was uh some go ahead if we

1288
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,200
could get him the

1289
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,240
and there's also you okay

1290
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,760
you too nice

1291
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,280
hi jeff leiffer from center for

1292
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,880
international private enterprise and

1293
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,160
thanks for a good discussion maybe a

1294
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
short comment as an expat immigrating

1295
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,520
here and then a question for the panel

1296
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,160
but you talked about attracting talent

1297
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,400
the czech republic almost pulling away

1298
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,560
slovak students is an american married

1299
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,400
to a slovak who left 11 years ago and

1300
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,800
she's coming back for my new job here

1301
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,480
i'm navigating the foreign police and

1302
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,400
the bureaucracy here is just

1303
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,400
you can see what a deterrent it is to

1304
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,920
bring to anybody wanting to actually

1305
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,880
come and live here from outside

1306
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,720
a couple months ago so oh you still have

1307
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:41,440
like 12 15. i know and you said if one

1308
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,200
more document has to be notarized

1309
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,880
apostilled right and certified

1310
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,319
translated it's just

1311
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,319
it's like it just makes you say why

1312
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,319
would for universities would you ever

1313
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,599
get anybody who would want to come

1314
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,200
outside of the eu to move into this

1315
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,400
system because it's

1316
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,920
it really takes a huge amount of

1317
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,040
commitment if it wasn't for the fact

1318
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,720
that i was married to a slovak it just

1319
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,920
wouldn't work so i think that's

1320
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,440
something to think about in terms of

1321
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,119
moving up the value chain anecdotally

1322
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,319
i'm just sort of stunned by this

1323
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,640
accidentally the u.s is even worse i

1324
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,240
have to tell you getting anything done

1325
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,560
in the u.s forget it it's it's not yeah

1326
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,319
it's not easy in you i know i i know

1327
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,440
because my wife just went through that

1328
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,119
in the u.s too but my family live in

1329
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,599
america so i i know because it's

1330
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,520
impossible to do anything it takes a lot

1331
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,040
of determination for sure but i did have

1332
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,960
a question then for the panel about the

1333
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,960
whole idea of onshore or sort of

1334
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,960
restoring of supply chains we i've heard

1335
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,400
people in romania see this as an

1336
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,000
opportunity post covet and you hear of

1337
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,720
some desire in the western balkans to

1338
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,839
maybe they could be part of this

1339
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:36,160
reshoring is any of that realistic and

1340
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,520
based on this conversation we're hearing

1341
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,000
where might be the the places in central

1342
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,520
southeast europe that could potentially

1343
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,200
take advantage of that what would be the

1344
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,280
most promising markets you might see i

1345
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,200
think it was answered

1346
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,880
and from from my perspective it was

1347
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,800
answered worry by tara

1348
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,200
very simple who will be the

1349
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,040
most flexible at the moment

1350
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,280
and actually i i have uh

1351
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,119
i would like to react to what you said i

1352
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:01,119
mean it's about the whole environment

1353
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,880
that you create for the for the people

1354
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,880
coming into the country right i'm not

1355
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,640
slovak welcome check

1356
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,480
and i can tell you that for my kids that

1357
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,200
were that time very very young i mean

1358
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,760
the experience it uh with the foreign

1359
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,119
police was really drastical yeah

1360
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:18,800
and of course i'm

1361
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,880
i'm doing a little bit better but i mean

1362
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,599
if if you have this kind of conditions

1363
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,760
how you want to attract talent

1364
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,280
i mean

1365
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,520
basically you skew it they force you to

1366
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,839
queue in 24 hours

1367
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,839
up front in order to get in

1368
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,720
for i mean then we talk about european

1369
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,400
union yeah

1370
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,839
i mean schengen

1371
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,920
what are you talking about huh

1372
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,960
so

1373
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,880
good point yeah but your question

1374
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,800
regarding near shoring everybody is

1375
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,559
speaking about this and of course it

1376
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,040
depends because for instance i will give

1377
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,920
you a very concrete example ukraine and

1378
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,839
what is happening in this geopolitical

1379
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,640
rivalry between the west west and and

1380
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,119
china china is the biggest exporter of

1381
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,240
these rare materials

1382
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,800
and uh

1383
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,119
this is necessary to change this also

1384
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,960
from geopolitical reasons and safety

1385
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,119
reasons and ukraine on the other side

1386
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,559
has a lot of

1387
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,040
resources in titanium for instance which

1388
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,680
means in these areas i think it will be

1389
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,800
surely because not only economic reasons

1390
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,640
but also other political and

1391
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,480
geopolitical

1392
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,400
well there is the lithium the biggest

1393
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,720
lithium deposit outside of china is in

1394
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,520
this region right yeah czech republic

1395
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,960
and serbia

1396
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,520
but the bureaucracy surrounding it has

1397
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,000
made it almost impossible for the past

1398
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,440
20 years to get past this um

1399
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,119
schizophrenia of wanting to have

1400
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,920
mobility and cars and batteries and not

1401
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,480
wanting to harm the environment so you

1402
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,880
know so that's why everything is so slow

1403
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,960
and that's the debate

1404
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,480
to involve the electorate in

1405
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,960
understanding a little bit more what it

1406
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,040
means but looking at the uk we have a

1407
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,599
project within about in the uk

1408
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,440
you know it's a hundred times worse

1409
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,400
because

1410
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,800
people have lost the will to make

1411
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,160
anything manufacturing is a dying sector

1412
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
in the uk margaret thatcher started

1413
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,800
selling everything right and now we're

1414
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,720
trying to save the car sector by

1415
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,440
incentivizing

1416
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,160
you know packages and all of that so

1417
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,920
what did the government do gave money to

1418
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,720
stalantis and gave money to nissan

1419
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:34,240
right to make

1420
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,720
electric vehicles but didn't consider

1421
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,200
the battery didn't consider where the

1422
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,280
battery comes from and how it needs to

1423
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,880
be recycled because that's the other

1424
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,440
thing we keep talking about the

1425
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,599
final product it's actually the entire

1426
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,079
value chain it's from taking the

1427
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:52,640
material out of the ground turning it

1428
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,000
into

1429
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,400
active material for battery then making

1430
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,480
it into a battery then making a car that

1431
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,559
make and then you have to recycle all of

1432
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,200
that so returning it from the beginning

1433
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,520
back to the beginning and the recycling

1434
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,119
is the biggest challenge people were

1435
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,520
talking about charging being the biggest

1436
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,520
challenge i don't agree with that so

1437
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,440
much because i think charging the

1438
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,280
technology will change soon we will do

1439
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,680
it wirelessly you know we'll have little

1440
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,240
pads and we'll put our cars or scooters

1441
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,960
on top of those little pads and like

1442
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,599
like scotty with star wars and all of

1443
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,839
that maybe soon we won't even need cars

1444
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,440
they beam us up what do you think about

1445
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,880
that

1446
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,240
and i think there were two more

1447
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,400
questions uh from the there's two more

1448
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,920
so given that we have eight minutes left

1449
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,839
i think i'm gonna

1450
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,000
leave the floor to you yeah zaltenberger

1451
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,319
from hungary i have one comment on one

1452
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:44,480
question the question is uh how do you

1453
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,520
see the impact of the global minimum tax

1454
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,880
on eu and on the v4 countries

1455
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,760
and the comment on luring back young

1456
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,160
people to to the region

1457
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,559
i think it needs political stability not

1458
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,280
only growth or gdp growth but it's

1459
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,839
political stability if the people don't

1460
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,760
feel that they they can express their

1461
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,000
view and there is no free

1462
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,559
media they will not come back thank you

1463
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,319
yeah i agree

1464
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,400
regarding global minimum tax i don't see

1465
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,720
problem in this if it is uh this concept

1466
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,280
as it was agreed i mean that it will be

1467
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,800
for the for the

1468
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,839
uh i mean global international companies

1469
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,760
fifteen percent of course it will be

1470
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,319
ireland will be it will be affected but

1471
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,359
only are

1472
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:35,599
in hungary i think yeah only two

1473
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,520
european countries but it has logic i

1474
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,920
had nothing again against this

1475
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,119
what what we have been afraid uh when we

1476
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,880
when it was discussion about

1477
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,200
harmonization of the corporate income

1478
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,079
tax in europe it was much broader con

1479
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:51,680
growth broader

1480
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,920
project and it's still under discussion

1481
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,760
and the problem is

1482
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,920
when we did tax reform what we did we

1483
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,839
cancelled some taxes we reduced direct

1484
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,079
taxes and we

1485
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,960
we

1486
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,960
cancelled almost all exceptions

1487
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,880
deductions and special rates which means

1488
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,520
we broader the tax base

1489
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,319
and now you have problem because if you

1490
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,720
will if you if you want to have the same

1491
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,280
rate the same tax not only rate but tax

1492
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,599
corporate tax you have to have not only

1493
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,960
the same rate but also the same base

1494
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,800
and if you're speaking about the same

1495
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,880
tax base then the question is

1496
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,800
theoretically and also practically the

1497
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,000
best is to have broadest possible base

1498
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,079
and lowest possible

1499
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,680
rate

1500
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,119
but to to cancel to remove from the your

1501
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:40,559
tax system

1502
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,880
exceptions deductions and special rates

1503
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,280
is politically such difficult is almost

1504
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,000
impossible because you know

1505
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:48,880
the

1506
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,960
groups are are profiting from these

1507
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,960
they're very influential and so on so on

1508
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,559
which means it is impossible because i

1509
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,079
told at that time at the ecofin

1510
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,240
ministers i told my colleagues okay we

1511
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,559
will agree if we will take as common

1512
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,800
tax-based slovakian tax base but you

1513
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,559
will have to remove all these exceptions

1514
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,079
deductions special rates and is

1515
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,559
politically simply impossible but if not

1516
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,800
if it will take some kind of compromise

1517
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,079
of in the middle average tax base then

1518
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,319
we will have to impose to our system

1519
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,520
again

1520
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,359
deductions exceptions and so on which

1521
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,200
means it is practically impossible to

1522
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,960
have really

1523
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,559
one tax

1524
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,119
corporate tax which means not only rate

1525
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,760
but also base and on that note i mean

1526
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,200
especially when you get eastern europe

1527
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,319
there's a number of countries of course

1528
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,760
that don't have the euro some would

1529
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,119
argue you know if you try to harmonize

1530
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:36,480
the taxes but you don't share the same

1531
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,559
currency to some extent does that even

1532
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,079
work i don't think it is connected

1533
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,160
directly with the common currency

1534
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,240
uh regarding it was your previous

1535
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,480
question which we didn't answer is what

1536
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,200
happened with with eu after

1537
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,319
uk

1538
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:52,000
uh came mouth

1539
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,440
and it was interesting because i was

1540
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,599
finance minister two times once before

1541
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,880
euro

1542
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,880
and and second time after europe was

1543
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,960
implemented this was working and it was

1544
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,400
it no no but it was interesting from

1545
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,319
this point of view that at that time

1546
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,520
when it when it was without euro

1547
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,000
the the influence of of uk and others

1548
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,240
was was much much bigger but after euro

1549
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,440
was implemented the most decisions and

1550
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,760
and discussions have been done in the

1551
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,640
eurogroup discussion which means then in

1552
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,160
you in in

1553
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,960
european union ecofin finance ministers

1554
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,680
meeting was mostly irrelevant it's

1555
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,200
pointless because especially it's all

1556
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,799
about the european central bank right

1557
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,400
now exactly

1558
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,480
this was this was i think

1559
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,319
also important that

1560
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,359
because euro real influence of uk was

1561
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,359
really decreased in the in the european

1562
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,280
union but then how does this apply to

1563
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,880
perhaps eastern europe you know again

1564
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,559
countries that say we want to stick with

1565
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,079
our national currency because it gives

1566
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,000
us a competitive edge but as you said

1567
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,280
the big decisions in the year

1568
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,440
architecture are done now by the big

1569
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,520
holders of the euro so doesn't that take

1570
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,880
away some of the leverage that you could

1571
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,200
have and not only not only for small and

1572
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,640
open economy to be in eurozone is in my

1573
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,359
opinion much much has much more

1574
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:07,520
positives than the negatives okay if

1575
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,359
you're speaking about about the uk it is

1576
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,680
different story but look at estonia

1577
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,880
estonia entered eurozone in the peak of

1578
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,480
of crisis in 2010 i think yeah

1579
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,480
or 11 which means which means because

1580
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,799
they they know that for them

1581
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,040
a small and open country doesn't have

1582
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,880
independent monetary policy it is simply

1583
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,880
impossible from the definition which

1584
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,640
means then if you are so interconnected

1585
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,640
with the eurozone countries economically

1586
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,960
slovakia is there's no no doubt that it

1587
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,880
is better to be despite of the of the

1588
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,960
problems and costs and maybe potential

1589
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,720
future costs which we still don't know

1590
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,240
what they'll be exactly and you know

1591
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,760
that's that's also i find it very

1592
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,119
interesting uh you know there's a number

1593
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,799
of again not to name and change anyone

1594
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:48,240
but you know against some of the eastern

1595
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,520
european countries that have their own

1596
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,280
currencies you know behind the scenes

1597
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,880
the finance ministry will tell you we

1598
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,480
want to keep it because we devalue

1599
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,319
quickly we jump out of crisis very

1600
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,400
quickly and we play that that game you

1601
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,520
know the way that perhaps you know

1602
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,040
countries like italy and spain used to

1603
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,559
do before they became big members of the

1604
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,200
euro area is that logic ultimately in

1605
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,280
their long run flawed it's doing more

1606
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,440
damage than good

1607
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,880
in the long run we don't know of course

1608
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,400
you know prognosis is difficult

1609
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,319
especially future habits

1610
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,559
it is difficult to say but look at today

1611
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:18,240
what is development about this inflation

1612
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,000
development in poland czech republic

1613
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,319
hungary and what is in slovakia

1614
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,640
yeah which we can see also now the the i

1615
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,880
mean positive uh consequences of the

1616
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,480
being in the interior would you agree

1617
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,319
with that do you see any you would agree

1618
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,160
with that i mean look at the czech

1619
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,400
republic i mean being czech i mean the

1620
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,799
influence from germany is what sixty

1621
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,640
percent right so what do you wanna do

1622
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,400
and the other eurozone countries are

1623
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,240
remaining 25.

1624
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,960
what are we talking here about

1625
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,720
and i think there was a final question

1626
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,160
from the audience was that you the one

1627
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:51,118
yeah let's take that one

1628
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,160
hi my name is andre shimon i'm also from

1629
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,520
hungary my question is first i fully

1630
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,280
agree with mr miklos about the

1631
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,040
importance of

1632
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,119
creative destruction and continuous

1633
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:05,680
modernization to speed up the

1634
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:07,839
development of europe

1635
00:58:07,839 --> 00:58:09,200
however

1636
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,520
this takes means taking risks

1637
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,000
and moving people out of their comfort

1638
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,040
zone

1639
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,400
which europeans have never been good at

1640
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,040
compared to americans for various

1641
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,480
historic reasons

1642
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,559
but the challenges for politicians the

1643
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,640
following if you look at the last 15

1644
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,599
years we had two major crises we had the

1645
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,920
financial and economic crisis and now we

1646
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,440
had the pandemic

1647
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,400
the consequence of this is that people

1648
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,839
i presume want more security

1649
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:42,079
rather than less security

1650
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,240
and then you have a politician who wants

1651
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,400
to get reelected

1652
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,880
and he chooses between

1653
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,119
giving people more security and slower

1654
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,960
growth potentially

1655
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,200
or taking the risk

1656
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,280
of not being reelected so what is the

1657
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,920
motivation for politicians

1658
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,680
in your view

1659
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,559
to actually go and take the risk

1660
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,480
and moving trying to

1661
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,799
to move people out of their comfort zone

1662
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,119
in such an environment

1663
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,799
if you're able to answer that then

1664
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,720
you're in for for a noble

1665
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,040
politics what is what is it exactly you

1666
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,280
are right it is you you you i i mean

1667
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,119
describe the the situation very very

1668
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:23,040
correctly and precisely

1669
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,760
the

1670
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,400
motivation has to be to change the the

1671
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,520
this vicious cycle and to not to be

1672
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,559
leader and and and statement and not the

1673
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:35,040
ordinary politician i know that

1674
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,119
even i i have to say that i am not not

1675
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,799
optimist regarding the

1676
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,559
future development not only in this

1677
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,559
region but finally in long-term

1678
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,480
perspective i think finally if we will

1679
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,040
see that it doesn't work

1680
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,720
it is necessary to change this that

1681
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,319
hopefully hopefully it will be changed

1682
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:51,920
because you know finally

1683
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,880
i very i like this kind of uh

1684
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,200
words that politicians are are doing

1685
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,960
what is necessary and useful after

1686
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,640
trying and everything else

1687
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:03,920
do you wanna

1688
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,720
how about how about a game to change

1689
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,319
politicians

1690
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,599
space with private sectors so company

1691
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,280
chairman could go and become politicians

1692
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,119
and politicians could come and run the

1693
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,520
private sector for a bit because i think

1694
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,720
this uh

1695
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,200
public private partnership is where it's

1696
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,760
at this is in singapore i mean yeah

1697
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,079
you have to have 20 years of experience

1698
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,960
in the private sector in

1699
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,319
i'm pretty sure you speak to a lot of

1700
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,319
companies and but also a lot of

1701
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,839
politicians you speak to a lot of you

1702
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,119
speak to a lot of people all the time to

1703
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,880
try to make this happen when you speak

1704
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,559
in particular to politicians what is it

1705
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,839
that you tell them i'm sure you always

1706
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:48,720
tell them

1707
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,240
the one line i mean there's got to be

1708
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,240
something that you repeat we need to get

1709
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,160
this right

1710
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,280
well

1711
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,440
it's a brilliant question but what is

1712
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,319
coming

1713
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:01,520
as a most of the times in current

1714
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,280
times i would say last couple of years

1715
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,240
is the fragility of the government okay

1716
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,920
yeah so you don't have the the kind of

1717
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,920
interesting

1718
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,319
yes

1719
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,079
but you cannot be really strong leader

1720
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,920
if you don't have the ultimate support

1721
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,599
yeah and then

1722
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,520
we can have a look at slovakia we can

1723
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,520
have a look at czech republic

1724
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:24,000
i mean not only i mean if you have

1725
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,280
actually five uh five parties in the in

1726
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,119
the government how stable the government

1727
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:30,880
is and how much

1728
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,040
political power you have to do something

1729
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,000
right

1730
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
yeah and can i just ask you since we're

1731
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,440
out of time but i'm still curious you

1732
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,280
know there's all this recovery fund you

1733
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,720
know money they say it's green it's

1734
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,240
digital it's going to take europe to the

1735
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,799
next kind of big industrial revolution

1736
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,240
are you excited about that do you think

1737
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,839
it's going to turn into another junker

1738
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:51,839
plan that he looks very excited look

1739
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,319
what was minister what was minister

1740
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:57,039
dhulejah saying uh one hour ago here so

1741
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,680
excited he said for me the priority is

1742
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,200
to build the roads

1743
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,880
the priority number one is maybe two

1744
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,799
elections pulled him off

1745
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,720
yeah pulled him off but but i fully

1746
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,720
agree with him i mean we really have to

1747
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,880
set one priority number one

1748
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,640
i mean you cannot have five priorities

1749
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:13,760
number one

1750
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,920
because then you do nothing huh

1751
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,160
i mean of course you can do it

1752
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,559
together right you build the build the

1753
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,000
roads and you build the charging

1754
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,520
stations around it

1755
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:25,760
but you have to really focus

1756
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,839
and i think that from his perspective i

1757
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,440
really like what he said i mean let's

1758
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,359
focus on on rail i mean

1759
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,119
rail is actually the low-hanging fruit

1760
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,359
here if we get it funded

1761
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:38,480
exactly

1762
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,720
well time's up it went by very quickly

1763
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,319
so i hope you know it was it means that

1764
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,079

1773
