the last session but it's not the

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
least important topic in fact in many

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,240
ways it's one of the most important

20
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,680
topics today we're discussing

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,920
democracies and disorder in the new

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
geopolitics and how to uphold the west

23
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,920
it's a really interesting question in

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,240
december you know i know this is a broad

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,079
country thing but president biden in the

26
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,920

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,079
for democracy uh and it's raised a lot

28
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,560
of interesting questions you know is xi

summit of the non-democracies he's

31
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,520
raised a lot of questions of who's in

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,399
who's out what the line is why should we

33
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,240
care why are

34
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,360
uh democracies um feeling beleaguered

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,399
and knocked down and we're gonna have a

36
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
very smart conversation about that let

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,479
me to tell you about our panel

38
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,959
we have elsa plachowski's head of public

39
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,640
governance at the oecd she's been there

40
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,040
for 21 years uh has all sorts of

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,840
thoughtful uh provocations on this front

42
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
carl belt the former prime minister and

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
foreign minister of sweden now the

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
co-chair of the european council on

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,720
foreign relations the only guy here i

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,640
think taller than i am and i respect

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
that carl

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
ivan korchok who is of course the

49
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
foreign minister of slovakia the much

50
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,640
loved former ambassador of slovakia to

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
washington but we'll leave that aside uh

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,879
and then and then finally uh martha

53
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,000
paslot who's head of the uh cee the the

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
central and eastern european division in

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,480
transatlantic public policy uh at google

56
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,959
and based now in warsaw so let me just

57
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,720
open up with a question that i want to

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,319
throw to evon and really everyone you

59
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,720
know i think this question of

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,800
you know how do we put fuel back in the

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,840
tank of liberal democracy when you see

62
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,720
china today and you see zijin king just

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,879
sort of comfortably whacking you know

64
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,040
the heads of big companies and you know

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
quite comfortable uh uh in in his place

66
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,440
in the world in my sense when you look

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
at russia's provocations in the world

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
you know this i was just in the balkans

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,519
and you look at the uh military exercise

70
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,680
there and the intimidation that many of

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
the baltics are feeling right now russia

72
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,879
and china look like they're not having

73
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,799
any problems you can look at other parts

74
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,239
of the world and ask you know how's

75
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,799
autocracy doing you know not badly you'd

76
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,640
have to say if you were objective but if

77
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,000
you look at democracies everyone's

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,840
saying we have to restore democracy we

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
have to uh rebuild it we have to remind

80
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,599
people of what democracy delivers and so

81
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
i guess my question to you is from

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
from you know from slovakia's position

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,040
or from all of your position how do

84
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,959
people citizens in liberal democracy

85
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,560
supposed to look at this how do we

86
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
refuel and how are you supposed to look

87
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,720
at the world as it is right now does

88
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,959
liberal democracy look like a

89
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,200
like a a solvent form of government for

90
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
the future

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
well

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
thank you steve and uh many thanks to

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,319
the organizers for bringing us all here

94
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,239
together and this beautiful

95
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,720
scenery uh behind us

96
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
um

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,239
i think the title of this panel is if i

98
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,720
may help myself with that is democracies

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,600
disorder in the new geopolitics how to

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,680
uphold the western i'm referring to it

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,759
because i'd like to link it i mean

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,759
your question about liberal democracies

103
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,560
and

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
the west and how to uphold it

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
first we have to

106
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
have clarity about

107
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,479
situation in which the west is finding

108
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,600
itself

109
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
on a global scene

110
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,680
and in my view the the clarity about

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
that is as follows first our

112
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,880
opponents or those who are questioning

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
uh international liberal order are

114
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,840
sending a clear message of challenge to

115
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,720
the west and trying to portray the west

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,600
as less capable of

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
meeting and dealing with the challenges

118
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
uh globally that that we are facing so

119
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,720
it's obvious that opponents of that

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,960
system that has made us strong the west

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,039
are questioning the west's ability to

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,639
deal with that

123
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,759
second they are successfully dividing us

124
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,560
from outside the west we are not

125
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
the west as a whole we are not the west

126
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,840
as i understood it we would like to see

127
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,520
it the fact however is that this

128
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,000
division divisive

129
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
activities that not only come from

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,479
outside they do come from inside of our

131
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,320
western community

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,800
as well let's put it

133
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
as it is that

134
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,320
messages actually questioning

135
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,280
um

136
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,639
liberal democracy as such are coming

137
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,320
from within

138
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,039
including from this very region from

139
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,039
central and eastern europe where there

140
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,800
are some who believe

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,919
that liberal democracy is a synonym of

142
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,000
decadent western values we are

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,759
confronted with this type of messages

144
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,520
and that

145
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,639
that's very uh very bad

146
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
and

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,880
thirdly

148
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
in my own

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
perspective

150
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,000
i'll be very open here maybe i'll go

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,240
beyond diplomatic language i am now a

152
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
bit more uncertain

153
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,520
about position of the western of global

154
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
scene as we speak

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,319
then i was enthusiastic at the beginning

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,199
of the year following the change of u.s

157
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
administration i'm not saying that that

158
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,639
i i expected more of togetherness of the

159
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,240
west with the new american

160
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,880
administration i'm not saying that

161
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
um we are more divided because we know

162
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,680
clarify what what did the u.s not do

163
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,560
that you thought would have moved

164
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
the the picture uh

165
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,280
balance sheet of this year after

166
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840
u.s american u.s

167
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,759
government came to office is mixed i

168
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,840
would say because we cannot

169
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
underestimate the fact that you as is

170
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
back you has returned to institutions by

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,680
the way

172
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,240
we've seen yesterday a very good example

173
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,319
of western leadership with this

174
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,319
breakthrough on global taxation of

175
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
companies

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,560
had there not been us leadership and

177
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
change of their position there would not

178
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
have been this major breakthrough

179
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
under matthias carmen

180
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,199
leadership yesterday yet we cannot

181
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,479
ignore

182
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,720
negative impact of

183
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,199
at least the way how the afghanistan

184
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,720
mission uh ended and let me say here

185
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
it's not only a problem

186
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,199
how our adversary adversaries and

187
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,520
opponents see us in the end of this

188
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
afghanistan the problem is that we

189
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
cannot justify the way how it ended back

190
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,400
home this is the problem as well

191
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,440
and two here i don't have a definitive

192
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,479
uh

193
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,720
effective position on it it's what

194
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,039
impact will will it have in the long or

195
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,039
mid-term perspective the

196
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,840
oculus the of australia united kingdom

197
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,639
and u.s uh partnership why i maintain my

198
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
position i understand what they did and

199
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,000
why they did so right nevertheless we'll

200
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,720
we'll see what impact that will have on

201
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,199
what we would like to see more unity of

202
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,800
of west uh globally i'll i'll stop by

203
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,599
saying that maybe it will not be as i

204
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,599
naively believe and hope in at the

205
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,319
beginning of this year that west as as

206
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,080
one whole as a whole

207
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
we'll try to do things together maybe we

208
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,640
will see continue

209
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,399
fragmentation of the west we will see

210
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,719
maybe the american west european west

211
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,360
indo-pacific west and here here i have

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
some some doubts whether we will be

213
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,559
better off

214
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,200
with this approach of the west uh

215
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,680
in in confrontation with the challenges

216
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
globally and about

217
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
liberal democracy i can speak endlessly

218
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,560
so i have tried to control myself about

219
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,760
it but i i refer to the fact yes there

220
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,560
are voices coming from within western

221
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,399
community regarding

222
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,800
uh liberal democracy and there are very

223
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,360
strong voices also coming from here from

224
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,760
from the central european region

225
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
but how would you refuel it yvonne

226
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,200
through

227
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
through clear positions to that i have a

228
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,440
clear position to it

229
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,279
which by the way

230
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,959
caused that i am

231
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,680
i am described as a as a

232
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,640
decadent proponent of western values but

233
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
when i say that i believe in in liberal

234
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,720
democracy the problem is

235
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
that populists and demagogues simply

236
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
manage to portray a picture as if

237
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,640
liberal democracy would be the same what

238
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
we understand under liberalism which is

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,320
completely by the way yeah so

240
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
this is the problem and we can refuel

241
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,360
only if we stick to what makes liberal

242
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,399
democracy such a successful concept

243
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,360
namely rule of law at its heart

244
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,519
isn't that isn't it for me it's shocking

245
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,120
in fact that

246
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
30 years after

247
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
1989 and so on and so on rule of law

248
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,160
becomes divisive issue within european

249
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
union rule of law becomes divisive issue

250
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,839
within this region

251
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
the cracks you know in this community

252
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,880
when we say that we should stick to rule

253
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
of law we can that we should discuss

254
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,360
rule of law as a criterion within

255
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
european union you can only refuel if

256
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
you believe in that and if you show that

257
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
believe and and demonstrate that's what

258
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
i'm trying to do right before i get to

259
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
el santo and ask carl that you talk to

260
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,920
so many people across

261
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,600
the transatlantic relationship around

262
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
the world uh and in the european council

263
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
on foreign relations i'm interested not

264
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,120
only in your thoughts on this question

265
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
of how liberal democracies refuel and

266
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,800
what citizens feel about the time

267
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
they're in but i'd just like to know if

268
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,200
you were to basically imagine

269
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,560
what the

270
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,600
poll was among the people you encounter

271
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,360
about this question what's the level of

272
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,880
cynicism versus optimism

273
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,519
well there's a level of

274
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,839
hate and concern

275
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
so cynicism is high well i wouldn't call

276
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,640
it cynicism i recorded concern

277
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
when they look at some of the global

278
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,839
trends

279
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,720
not necessarily all of the global trends

280
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,360
because we are living in a period of

281
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
profound challenges transitions and

282
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,240
certainties and that leads to concern uh

283
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
because then are we going to be able to

284
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
manage this

285
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
our political system is going to be okay

286
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,760
our economy is going to be okay in this

287
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
hugely

288
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,519
tumultuous time in which we're living it

289
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,320
has to be said to be somewhat outside of

290
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
the conventional wisdom i belong to

291
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
those that are fairly confident in our

292
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
system i mean i've spent quite some time

293
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
in the last few weeks discussing with

294
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,040
russians

295
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,720
of different political persuasions do i

296
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,399
find any russians who really see their

297
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,240
society and political system as a model

298
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,320
for the world well i haven't detected

299
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,240
anyone i'm quite certain i've not been

300
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,560
inside the kremlin for some time

301
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,240
but outside of the kremlin you have

302
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,639
difficulties finding them do the chinese

303
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,720
see their model as uh something for the

304
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,920
world i mean they are intensely

305
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
nationalistic the chinese whatever their

306
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,920
political persuasion is by the way and

307
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,160
proud of their nations or whatever

308
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,880
but are they on a rampart across the

309
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
world to impose

310
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
a marxist model of governance of sweden

311
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,480
and slovakia i haven't seen that as of

312
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,279
yet

313
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,120
and i do think as a matter of fact if

314
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
you look at the big issues that are

315
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,399
ahead of us

316
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,920
the green transition the digital

317
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,279
transition all of that that we've talked

318
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,160
about i think that open societies

319
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
and open economies

320
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,399
have basically the best conditions for

321
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,800
managing it it doesn't mean that we will

322
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,200
be able to succeed in everything but we

323
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
are the best position

324
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,560
and then to be slightly unconventional

325
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,600
as well

326
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
the place that worries me

327
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,600
in terms of the future of the

328
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
credibility of democracy is a place

329
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
fairly close to you

330
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,399
um i'm less concerned with china

331
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,160
less concerned with russia in terms of

332
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,320
future democracy than i'm with what

333
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,399
might happen in the us in 2024. if you

334
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,880
face an extremely an election that is

335
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,680
now not only divisive in terms of

336
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,880
that or that

337
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,720
that's what democracy is all about but

338
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
about trust in the entire system and the

339
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,959
operating of the system that

340
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,639
could be very difficult to have i

341
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,160
completely agree but well i agree with

342
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,200
you also on on china and russia maybe

343
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
not having this messianic commitment to

344
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,240
transform uh everyone in the world i

345
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
tell everybody you know it's interesting

346
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
if you you know look at

347
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
you know science fiction sometimes

348
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,959
they're good metaphors in there and and

349
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,120
one of the metaphors you you had in

350
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,560
there was essentially if you guys have

351
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
watched star trek in the past one of the

352
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
enemies was the borg so you either wipe

353
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
out your enemy or you assimilate them

354
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,720
and i said that's america

355
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
no not not really but but you know i

356
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
think there's an interesting

357
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
uh question where where if you talk to

358
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,480
sergey karaganov who maybe is close to

359
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,839
putin not close boot and you talk to

360
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,680
leading chinese intellectuals while i

361
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,639
agree with you at the same time they all

362
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,040
are uh and for years have been

363
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
dismissive about

364
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
the chances of democracy succeeding in

365
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
this era and and i if i were an honest

366
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,720
and completely objective person

367
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
assessing this i would have to say that

368
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,720
so far they've been right or wrong more

369
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,800
right than wrong and and while i know

370
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,639
history doesn't move in straight lines i

371
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,480
would associate my views you know

372
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,560
closely with yvonne korchok so i'm i'm

373
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,800
interested that they are enjoying this

374
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,959
moment and watching us self

375
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,279
self decline if you will i i can see

376
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,839
some chinese being fairly sort of

377
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,000
convinced that they've done fairly well

378
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
which to some extent is absolutely true

379
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,160
but

380
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
how have they

381
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,199
done well they have done well by

382
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,560
liberalizing the economy in their

383
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,440
society that's what they do they'd feed

384
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,880
up the tremendous entrepreneurial spirit

385
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
of the chinese nation as we've seen

386
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,639
previously in singapore and taiwan the

387
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,320
next numbers of places and the more

388
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,839
they've liberalized the better they've

389
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,399
done it and that's extremely impressive

390
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,839
they're going to be the most powerful

391
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,079
economy in the world within a couple of

392
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,959
years

393
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,959
if they go back on that and their

394
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,279
tendencies to that they've got to do

395
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,320
less well

396
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
russia has done miserable

397
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
i mean i remember

398
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
sort of x numbers of years ago when we

399
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,279
were talking with the russians quite a

400
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,639
lot on the official level on a

401
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,240
partnership for modernization with

402
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,760
russia i think that was an extremely

403
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,680
good thing i don't think so well

404
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,800
now we have neither partnership nor

405
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
modernization for russia right but

406
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,680
that's the sort of messianistic approach

407
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,519
on the side of european union believing

408
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,959
that we can modernize russia from

409
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,120
outside no but we can help them to

410
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,639
modernize but if they don't want to

411
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,399
modernize we can't really then the

412
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,920
response 2014 was ukraine you know well

413
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,519
let's see what the nbc has this that's

414
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
another issue that's another issue

415
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,360
so elsa you sit on the world's greatest

416
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,920
reservoirs of data and you've been

417
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,040
watching these nations within the oecd

418
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
forever so what is the

419
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
secret sauce to refueling a liberal

420
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
democracy and pushing reset in a way

421
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,639
that's compelling and convincing is

422
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
there anything within your institution

423
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,880
that gives us that answer yes thank you

424
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
very much

425
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
so let me just start by rebounding a

426
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,600
little bit on the international tax

427
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,120
agreement because i actually think this

428
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,759
is the best news for democracies um that

429
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,600
we've had in a long time

430
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,920
the us was a main was a very big player

431
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,199
but so were many uh eu democracies as

432
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,240
well

433
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,560
so it's one of those things that shapes

434
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
the the future world in terms of the

435
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,639
standards that democracies hold on to

436
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,160
the second thing i want to say is that

437
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,639
really democracy is hard work it's never

438
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,480
a given

439
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
the issue is that

440
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,040
yes there is low trust that we have lost

441
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,800
democracies have lost

442
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
some parts of the population that are

443
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,120
dissociating themselves from the from

444
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,079
the traditional democratic mechanisms so

445
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,839
the idea is how do we regain that part

446
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,920
of the population and

447
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,160
secretary of state blink and this week

448
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,480
at the oecd said democracy it's not

449
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
about what we are against it's it's

450
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,280
about what we what we stand for

451
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,959
and i think this is what refueling is

452
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,559
about is about it's about what do we

453
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,959
stand for as a collective

454
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,880
and we have three ways of looking at it

455
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,199
we see three main threats the first one

456
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,199
is really something not structural but

457
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,359
it's something that really amplifies the

458
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,959
problem it's misinformation this

459
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
information and how how this fits in

460
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,200
providing fueling you know hatred and

461
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,880
fueling parts of the population

462
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
dissociating themselves

463
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,000
the second one is really participation

464
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,520
and representation we're at a stage

465
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,520
where democracies have to absolutely

466
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,720
modernize

467
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,360
to increase representation participation

468
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,280
how we make decision making in our

469
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,520
democracies and the third one and it's

470
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,039
been touched upon is about how

471
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,520
democracies are able to work together on

472
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
global challenges so of course this is

473
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,960
related to the international tax

474
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,919
agreement

475
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,240
but climate is another issue what we are

476
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,919
seeing is that one of the reasons why

477
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,240
people dissociate themselves from their

478
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,559
national governments is because

479
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,240
rightly so they think that their

480
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
governments alone

481
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,480
cannot actually tackle climate climate

482
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
change so why would they vote why would

483
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
they vote why would they trust their

484
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
government to address climate change

485
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,640
alone so how do we work together and how

486
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,480
do we stand for those values will be

487
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,000
structural in the future so i know

488
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,440
you're posing the questions i want you

489
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,960
to give us the answers

490
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
uh uh but you know i'm i'm interested in

491
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,320
something so i want to challenge you on

492
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
just just one element of it which is say

493
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
that democracy is hard work we have to

494
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,320
work harder democracy you know i think

495
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,000
and you know excuse me for being crude

496
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,960
democracy's story used to be basically

497
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,039
that in the aggregate

498
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,760
it was everybody won you had big winners

499
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,520
but then you had little winners minority

500
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,280
parties and democracies were also

501
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,720
winners because in the aggregate you

502
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
move things forward and at the end they

503
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,080
had a chance to do it today's toxicity

504
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,400
in many liberal democracies in a zero

505
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,200
sum

506
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,880
you know to the death

507
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,160
uh view on competition means that notion

508
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,840
of we have to work harder in democracy

509
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,600
just doesn't sell well because you have

510
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,679
too many people who don't believe that

511
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,240
modality is real because they're they

512
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,080
lose so big and that's their perception

513
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,559
anyway so i'm just using any insights

514
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,039
you have on that do we have any models

515
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,160
uh or any experiences where nations that

516
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,840
have reached that level of toxicity have

517
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,720
come back

518
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,600
well

519
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,440
there are examples throughout history

520
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,840
but if you want recipes for success i

521
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
mean again uh

522
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,679
some of the challenges that we're seeing

523
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,840
like rising inequalities are not linked

524
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,520
only to what's happening at that

525
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,200
domestic level but are linked to really

526
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,760
global trends and these trends can only

527
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,360
be addressed together

528
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
and this is why i mean the agreement of

529
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,600
yesterday is such a big big success for

530
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,840
democracies is because it's it is about

531
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,400
also reducing inequalities in equities

532
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,679
globally

533
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,440
through the democratic system through

534
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,120
nations democratic nations working

535
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,320
together and of course we're bringing

536
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,559
other nations at the same time but a lot

537
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,760
of those challenges will have to be

538
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,840
addressed about how democracies are able

539
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,159
to join up and address these global

540
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,520
challenges that actually have an

541
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,480
influence on people's lives every day

542
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,880
so that's one big thing martha you sit

543
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
in warsaw i don't know if poland's going

544
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,039
to get to go to the summit for democracy

545
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,360
or even appear online what's that they

546
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
got the invite so

547
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,600
they they got oh they did get an invite

548
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,520
yeah so that's an interesting

549
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
interesting thing i do not know i'm not

550
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,720
aware

551
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,640
i don't think anybody's aware of that so

552
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,400
that may be real news folks and that's

553
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,679
going to start a lot of controversies

554
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,880
because i think they're countries like

555
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,240
poland hungary

556
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,039
india turkey which have been on the line

557
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,440
you've seen tony blanken's tweets and

558
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,600
profound thanks to turkey

559
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
after you know the mess in afghanistan

560
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,919
calling them a dependable and stable and

561
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,600
important ally of the united states the

562
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
rhetoric has completely changed because

563
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,039
it you know it was not about democracy

564
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,360
per se but there was a kind of you know

565
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,440
a a much more tentative treatment of

566
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,200
turkey at the beginning of the bidet

567
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,400
administration so you can kind of see

568
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,000
the up and downs of these things but let

569
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,159
me ask you this and you know i i know

570
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,000
there may be some sensitivities here as

571
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,799
you're in another big uh tech platform

572
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
but we've just had the most riveting

573
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,159
testimony

574
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,200
uh that i've ever seen about large

575
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
transnational technology platforms in

576
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,280
the us congress this past week with

577
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,520
francis haugen kind of

578
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,600
sharing information in her perspective

579
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,679
and view and data and thousands and

580
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,159
thousands of pages of material showing

581
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,960
that facebook profits from sowing

582
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,720
division and dissension

583
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,960
and her concern about child safety her

584
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,240
concern about what this does to stoke

585
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
deep divisions now you know i have to

586
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
say that if we've been having this

587
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,919
discussion five or ten years ago i don't

588
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,200
think we would have well maybe five

589
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,240
years ago we still would have been

590
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,840
talking about it but less knowledgeably

591
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,000
because of the the the testimony but i

592
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
guess my question is i know you believe

593
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,080
and i know many people at google believe

594
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,640
that it has to help implant and embed

595
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,360
democratic values but but let's just say

596
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
google was born in china and not the

597
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
united states you know i think one of

598
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
the interesting questions is how

599
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,640
skeptical should we be of your industry

600
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,400
thank you for an easy question

601
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,799
uh but i i'd like to be in fashion and

602
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,640
uh before i go into this a huge uh big

603
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,000
up to the oecd tax agreement

604
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,120
um

605
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,679
and i think that's the best example of

606
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,640
multilateralism that is back and that is

607
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,039
working so one of my messages to your

608
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,400
question that you didn't ask me about

609
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,799
refueling uh liberal democracies is that

610
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,080
don't panic things are starting um to

611
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,120
work but um going to your question i i

612
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,360
don't feel i'm in a position to very

613
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,520
concretely comment on on facebook and

614
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,720
the testimony but um i can talk about my

615
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,240
experience from the past few months

616
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,919
where all these conferences and

617
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,080
gatherings um are back um each and every

618
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,000
foreign policy or tech policy conference

619
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,919
would be hosting two panels one panel

620
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,280
would be about

621
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,919
how do we want to prevent ourselves from

622
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,240
threats coming from china and russia and

623
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,720
then we all send the message if we feel

624
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,880
we're at risk we should be strengthening

625
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,559
our alliances we should be coming

626
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,320
together and then in another room

627
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,919
usually in parallel so you can go to

628
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,120
both you're getting a panel on our tech

629
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,960
platforms a threat uh to democracy and i

630
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
think this these panels should be hosted

631
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,919
uh in one room and i think

632
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,640
uh speaking of being scared of the of

633
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,480
the industry and

634
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
um and the differences between being

635
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,919
born uh as a tech company in the us and

636
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,919
china is that you would never look at

637
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,159
u.s tech companies as subjects of

638
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,400
weaponization which you see in china and

639
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,919
these are two different realities and

640
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,960
the fact that of course there are issues

641
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,840
and

642
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
the choice is not between regulation no

643
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,559
regulation but finding a way to figure

644
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,919
things out and we're at a time when

645
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,000
a ton of issues associated with

646
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
platforms is on the top of the of the

647
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,600
regulatory agenda but it's not that they

648
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,760
have significantly increased we are the

649
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,360
last industry that hasn't got

650
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,520
sufficiently regulated it's good that

651
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
we're having this discussion and

652
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,159
um and everyone is aware that things

653
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,159
need to change but the same fact that

654
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,799
you have a testimony in the u.s senate

655
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,360
um sends a message that we're most

656
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
likely on a way to get issues resolved

657
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,679
but we are under the scrutiny of

658
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,320
regulators and we can solve the issues

659
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,159
in under in order to brace ourselves and

660
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,400
be able to respond to external threats

661
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,960
because i strongly believe that

662
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,080
external risks to liberal democracy are

663
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,120
incomparable with internal risks and

664
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
um

665
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,919
you know we've we've been for a long

666
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,400
time uh especially under the previous

667
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
u.s

668
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,799
administration

669
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,559
using high-level language because we

670
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,200
didn't have partners to talk to so all

671
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
we had left was

672
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
very high level headlines and

673
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,640
what now when you look into the to the

674
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
detail again oecd tax agreement who

675
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,799
would have thought a few months into

676
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,320
bidens in office

677
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,840
um and

678
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,000
and i actually have a poll for the

679
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,559
audience um how many of you are aware of

680
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,520
the fact that eus uh you do you and the

681
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,960
u.s launched a trade and technology

682
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,080
council 10 days ago

683
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,919
okay you're not representative because

684
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,440
because these are all foreign policy

685
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,120
junkies but it's still i just want to

686
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,320
say that i was aware of it because you

687
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,400
told me to be aware of it

688
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,799
but it's still but it's still like it's

689
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,600
a group of of uh policy junkies in the

690
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
room and uh it's like

691
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,039
can i ask you a question about it i mean

692
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,039
one of the one of the big divides that's

693
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,320
developing and i don't know how it's

694
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
going to go but if you talk to members

695
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,559
of congress or the senate even the

696
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,000
administration about what the defining

697
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,440
challenge of this time it's going to be

698
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,039
how to figure out how to compete and

699
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,200
deal with uh the rise in competition

700
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,120
from china and that really i mean so

701
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,320
that's what you know huawei that's

702
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,840
across the board to kind of look at it i

703
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
think one of the questions comes up is

704
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,360
what are the united states and and

705
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,400
europe doing and and should you end up

706
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
in a situation

707
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,080
i won't call it a cold war but a split

708
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,720
in standards a split in interest a split

709
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,440
in the way information systems work you

710
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,760
know my question to you is if the e what

711
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
can the eu and u.s do because when i

712
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,440
families if you look at where the future

713
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,600
of the global middle class is the net

714
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,600
rise in that it's not in the united

715
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,720
st china essentially carte blanche to

716
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,880
harvest that rising global middle class

717
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,200
tomorrow so so that's part of the stakes

718
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,240
involved with with failure but i i know

719
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,840
in this multilateralism and the work

720
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,000
there i'd love to hear if if europe and

721
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,080
the united states are aligning any way

722
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,400
to prevent that future from happening

723
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
martha i think this is exactly what's

724
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
what's happening with the ttc and you

725
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
know things get boring so

726
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,400
you have 10 working groups that are

727
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,600
addressing

728
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,559
major

729
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,760
questions

730
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,880
uh in my view aimed at preventing that

731
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
situation

732
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,200
uh from happening and

733
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,279
i think we should be all

734
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,880
approaching this with a lot of goodwill

735
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,440
with an open mind

736
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,799
and

737
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,840
you know in the past few weeks we've

738
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,720
also seen different kinds of overblown

739
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,600
uh

740
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,760
reactions that show a little bit of

741
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,440
impatience but

742
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,120
i think there is a lot to getting down

743
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,120
to work again and getting out of the

744
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,320
panel rooms uh joining working groups

745
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,760
um

746
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,559
and working together and technology here

747
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,080
is a fantastic example it's not only us

748
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,679
as tech platforms but it's pretty much

749
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,279
everything else carl i know you wanted

750
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,480
to jump in

751
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,159
no i mean the only way i mean you say

752
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,919
huawei i mean

753
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,840
fairly easy to sort you can buy erics in

754
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,200
a nokia

755
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
or you can buy samsung

756
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,320
and that sort of answers the question

757
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,039
also we can't really stop the chinese

758
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,840
1.3 billion people that want to do

759
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,640
better the only thing that we can do and

760
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,840
must do is be better than

761
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,760
them uh and just to challenge you on

762
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,600
that erickson nokia if you talk to

763
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,799
either of them which i have at the

764
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,720
highest level they will tell you the

765
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,159
european eu is doing nothing to create

766
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,880
financial uh export support you know the

767
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,679
kind of support that china has in in

768
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,159
position china goes into small countries

769
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,919
and says we'll give you this essentially

770
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,240
for free over you know with a debt basis

771
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,880
that's so low sometimes so we need to

772
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,559
provide finance we can do that i mean

773
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,840
the number one problem that we have in

774
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,000
europe that we have as usual a

775
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,600
fragmented market

776
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,840
uh we are in terms of 5d implementation

777
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,320
the the chinese are way ahead right

778
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,080
partly to large extent with european

779
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,520
technology by the way because that's the

780
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,720
best one

781
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,279
then comes the us and europe is lagging

782
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,919
behind in spite of the fact that we've

783
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,679
been world leaders in this particular

784
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,720
technology for decades we invented it

785
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
uh but then we have fragmented market

786
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,080
and we don't have the

787
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,159
depth of the capital markets and the

788
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,880
chinese have been extremely good in

789
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,640
inventing in basic research and

790
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,880
development and that has to be said the

791
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
chinese are ferociously entrepreneurial

792
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,240
ferociously entrepreneurial and we need

793
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,679
to learn from that let me ask you

794
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,039
there's no reason i mean we are not

795
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,440
genetically

796
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,159
bad i wanna go to the okay i wanna go to

797
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,919
the audience after the next question i

798
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,200
post you so i hope you'll think about

799
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,559
your questions but the the other

800
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,399
question i have is sort of tied to two

801
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,799
dimensions of it is you know

802
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,480
you know when i used to be at the new

803
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,240
america foundation we were hiring a lot

804
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,840
of people in the terrorism game right so

805
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,200
peter berg and others and we would look

806
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,279
kind of dismissively not me but others

807
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,600
at how news and information sort of

808
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,679
traveled through conspiracy theories in

809
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,799
the middle east that if you look at the

810
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,480
middle east conspiracy theories

811
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,399
dominated the scene and it was like that

812
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,880
could never be us well guess what

813
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,159
guess what

814
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,159
conspiracy theories are the currency of

815
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,200
the day

816
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,159
uh uh in the united states at least i i

817
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,520
think in many you know the the

818
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
propagation of disinformation the

819
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,799
institutionalization the routinization

820
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,279
of disinformation uh and i know that

821
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,760
that um elsa this is a big priority for

822
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,880
you but it's also part of the new form

823
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,559
of conflict that if you kind of you know

824
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,159
cross the line from economics to look at

825
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,520
you know what are the russians getting

826
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,600
really good at you know figuring out how

827
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,960
to sow disinformation plant

828
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,200
disinformation i think to be honest the

829
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,480
united states used to be good at this in

830
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
the 1950s the cia was really good at

831
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,279
those covert games i don't know where we

832
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,240
lost

833
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,600
our experience but but it seems we have

834
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,760
and i'm just interested evon as you look

835
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,440
at it as you look at the just the

836
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,120
governments in this neighborhood where

837
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,200
where you see it practiced a lot of

838
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,480
people and you know we've known each

839
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
other now for years this is a constant

840
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,039
theme why are we so slow

841
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,960
why do we keep talking about it and

842
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,679
there's so little action and actually

843
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:47,200
creating

844
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,159
a robust and effective neutralizer of

845
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,799
disinformation

846
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,279
can i comment a little bit on what kyle

847
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,360
has said i think twice and i agree with

848
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,919
him when he referred to the chinese

849
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,320
extreme entrepreneurial

850
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,080
approach and their aggressiveness and

851
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,559
there's an assertiveness yeah

852
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,960
he he also rightly said that they have

853
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,120
liberalized economy and therefore we see

854
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,120
this increase of economic power but i

855
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,440
i wanted to say that we'll see what

856
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,760
consequence that will have over time

857
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,559
right because my point here is

858
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,799
do you know why i'm why i'm such a

859
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,679
strong

860
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,440
proponent and champion of liberal

861
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,440
democracy because i believe in its

862
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,840
uniqueness based on the fact that it

863
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,799
provides like no other system right the

864
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,000
highest level of individual freedom

865
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
right while ensuring prosperity and we

866
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,399
know one thing about china

867
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,480
but they are economically doing very

868
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,440
well

869
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,000
nevertheless over time we will see

870
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,360
see what consequence will will have on

871
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,679
this system the fact that they're not

872
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,480
providing individual freedoms right

873
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,760
and therefore we

874
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,960
now are almost panicking

875
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,799
in view of this confrontation without

876
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,880
them where we are losing on many fronts

877
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,840
but we don't know what will come in 10

878
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,559
to 15 years and because we don't know

879
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,480
right the consequence should not be that

880
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,559
we are less trustful that we are less

881
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,279
convinced of our own strength of those

882
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,200
countries who believe in liberal

883
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,120
democracies and you're the problem this

884
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
information political problem is the

885
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
economic clause is here is the

886
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,159
reformer of slovakia from the 90s and

887
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,840
beginning of the century

888
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,399
the problem is that while we can believe

889
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,760
in this we are desperately incapable of

890
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,919
transferring that message convincingly

891
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,480
to our own electorate right we have

892
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,399
completely decoupled and partly we're

893
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,559
failing on making clear the liberal

894
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,840
democracy

895
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
is about jobs it's about bread it's

896
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,720
about opportunities for investment in

897
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,600
the the independent judiciary it's not

898
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,320
an intellectual sort of you know blah

899
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,440
blah

900
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,159
without that independent judiciary there

901
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,919
will not be prosperity there will not be

902
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,320
jobs and free trade and free and free

903
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,279
trade

904
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,360
and number three i cannot agree more

905
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,840
with what you have said uh steve about

906
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,720
us being extremely slow but maybe you

907
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,799
were referring now rather to european

908
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,600
union if it's slow because

909
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,880
nationally we could be faster definitely

910
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,960
we are not but at the level of european

911
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
union we should definitely do more be

912
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,799
faster but

913
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,120
two we should not underestimate the fact

914
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,440
that we have things which nobody else

915
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,720
has on a transnational level

916
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,960
and that is regulatory power right that

917
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,799
is that the it's

918
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,679
trade in european union is a exclusive

919
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,320
competence individually we do not play

920
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
any role when it comes to trade

921
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,279
yes

922
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,320
so these strength strengths of us

923
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,159
european union should be something that

924
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,679
should be embraced also on a

925
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,360
transatlantic level and therefore

926
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,919
therefore i invite our american friends

927
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,640
to do more with us on this

928
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,880
but together when it comes to standard

929
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,279
our ability to set standards globally as

930
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,280
we did in oecd that would not be

931
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,800
possible without european union that

932
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,480
would not be possible without american

933
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,520
leadership

934
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,760
that's fantastic

935
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,679
this is but definitely but that's my

936
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,239
part of my um unstructured answer to how

937
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,040
to uphold the west because yeah this is

938
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,159
at stake

939
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,280
and either

940
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,399
these two parts of the west

941
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,639
while west does not mean geography of

942
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,480
course that's obvious it's a type of

943
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,040
governance that has made us strong

944
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,079
so

945
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,560
this this is i believe a great challenge

946
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,440
now how to convince of our own belief in

947
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,199
this and these values

948
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,359
how to convince our own electorate how

949
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,280
to survive next elections with that

950
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,199
thank you prime minister nelson um elsa

951
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,639
i know you wanted to jump into this on

952
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,040
the disinformation industry yeah this i

953
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,879
mean clearly this information is a very

954
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,520
big destabilizing factor

955
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,240
and you ask the why why have we left so

956
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,400
many weaknesses in the system developed

957
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,960
that then can be used either by internal

958
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,119
destabilizing forces or foreign ones

959
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,320
right whether they are state or

960
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
non-state

961
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,480
we haven't left them we just it's the

962
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
way the information ecosystems have

963
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
developed they used to be governed

964
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,920
within national boundaries and it's

965
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
complex governance systems where

966
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,079
government cannot really step in because

967
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,160
because otherwise it's big brother so

968
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,760
it's a complex governance system within

969
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,839
national boundaries now the information

970
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,599
ecosystems are global

971
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,839
so and we don't we don't we haven't

972
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,920
decided what form of governance we

973
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,680
wanted at the global level or at least

974
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,160
among democracies we haven't found the

975
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,640
regulatory way of addressing the social

976
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,760
media weaknesses etc so this is really

977
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,680
really hard work

978
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,839
but it's also a democratic trap in the

979
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,079
sense that governments cannot alone

980
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,839
step in and regulate the information

981
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,280
ecosystems because otherwise it's

982
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,359
governments regulating a system that is

983
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,880
supposed to be the media that is

984
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,320
supposed to be individual freedom that

985
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,240
is to be also calling into question

986
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,920
governments all the time

987
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,480
so it is a trap in which we are which is

988
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,720
which has both a global problem and also

989
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,520
just

990
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,920
who is legitimate i'm sorry so who is

991
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,160
legitimate in that setting to find the

992
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,320
right governance system well let me let

993
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,800
me ask marta this um

994
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,079
we were talking a little bit about

995
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,400
digital growth and digital norms uh

996
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,560
before digital growth needing

997
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,480
democratic norms excuse me not digital

998
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,200
norms but democratic norms but i guess

999
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,880
the question is you know we've heard the

1000
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,560
frustration about the government level

1001
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,119
inability to respond and control this so

1002
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,400
they're more and more looking to civil

1003
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,480
society we've also seen a period of time

1004
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,560
where candidly we've seen lots of

1005
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,040
governments failing to deliver and there

1006
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,720
are some positive cases where the

1007
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,560
corporate sector is stepping in now

1008
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,400
facebook aside

1009
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,359
do you see the possibility that there is

1010
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,680
an alignment and norms between a mega

1011
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,359
company like google

1012
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,320
uh

1013
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,920
solving this problem for governments i

1014
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,160
mean you know i mean google has the

1015
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,800
ability to to know whatever i'm thinking

1016
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,880
whatever i want to buy you have an

1017
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,680
ability to with ai and whatnot so you

1018
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
know who the evil people are out there

1019
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,520
trying to undermine democracies right

1020
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,880
you are the modern cia so i guess

1021
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,440
you know my question is can we expect

1022
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,920
more from you

1023
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,359
starting to take it personally steve but

1024
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,880
um

1025
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,839
so

1026
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,280
i think

1027
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,640
look

1028
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,160
i don't want to sound very boring and

1029
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,640
corporate but again let's go back to the

1030
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,599
basics and the framework we operate in

1031
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,720
and

1032
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,560
i think the foundation of ttc emerges

1033
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,280
exactly because there is an ambition and

1034
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,520
there is commitment to find

1035
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,000
an agreement on the rules between

1036
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,079
biggest allies and leaders of the free

1037
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,640
world and that being the european union

1038
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,599
um

1039
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,800
and the and the u.s and

1040
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,400
the transatlantic relationship might

1041
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,880
have evolved over the years and so has

1042
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,240
trade but it has never devolved into a

1043
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,920
partnership without

1044
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,720
uh

1045
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,320
values so

1046
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,280
uh self-regular sales regulation has

1047
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
progressed over the years but but we are

1048
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,480
at a time and we're not oblivious to

1049
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,320
some frustrations that are specifically

1050
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,880
here um in europe and getting

1051
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,400
governments on the same page and

1052
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,640
following their guidance is exactly what

1053
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,800
uh we should be we should be doing and

1054
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,560
google was i think the first tech

1055
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,520
company to applaud um the launch of

1056
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,119
trade and

1057
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,320
technology

1058
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,839
uh council and there are good reason why

1059
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,560
this work should be progressing one of

1060
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,680
them is because we do not as this as the

1061
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,839
west we're discussing today there is no

1062
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,240
pause button like the world is not going

1063
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,240
to wait the world is not going to wait

1064
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,040
and we need to make sure that we are

1065
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,760
aligned we are on the same page we're

1066
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,000
using our joint technological

1067
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,440
capabilities

1068
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,119
to act together

1069
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,240
against

1070
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,119
uh

1071
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,640
bad actors and the time

1072
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,720
the time is now and

1073
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,560
we've had a fantastic run table

1074
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,960
discussion it about strategic autonomy

1075
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,040
um many of you

1076
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,119
in breakup sessions discussed concepts

1077
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,640
of digital

1078
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,520
uh sovereignty and it just sounds

1079
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,119
sounds so off

1080
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,160
um

1081
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,040
and

1082
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,400
uh and and and worrying so

1083
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,119
definitely like right to your question

1084
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:34,880
we're definitely committed to be part of

1085
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,400
this conversation we're going to bring

1086
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,280
in whatever we know and whatever we uh

1087
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,200
believe in but certainly there needs to

1088
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,440
be a clear agreement between uh between

1089
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,359
europe and the us thank you for that

1090
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,880
minister

1091
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,680
the the issue is this is disinformation

1092
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,200
right yeah

1093
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,000
i agree tally with you with marta

1094
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,720
that governments can never

1095
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,800
do it without

1096
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,359
major platforms being part of that

1097
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,160
endeavor to deal with cope with this

1098
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,359
information

1099
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,000
however the political

1100
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,560
mistake is to believe that we can

1101
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,960
outsource that entirely on them

1102
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,760
right because i think based on

1103
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,680
my experience from my own country i

1104
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,480
believe

1105
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,200
the major source of disinformation which

1106
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,280
does influence

1107
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,160
political perceptions in slovakia

1108
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,960
which costs thousands of lives because

1109
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,280
of disinformation campaign around

1110
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,839
vaccination does not come from dark

1111
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,480
pages it comes from the polit

1112
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,119
politicians themselves i mean google can

1113
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,119
all help us facebook cannot help us

1114
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,839
either if a member of a parliament is a

1115
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,960
major source of disinformation confusing

1116
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,119
people and making them

1117
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,079
hesitant about vaccination as i believe

1118
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,400
the only recipe how to deal with that

1119
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,200
so

1120
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,760
again in each and every issue that we

1121
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,280
are discussing here

1122
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,680
it's about political responsibility it's

1123
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,960
about our

1124
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,760
resistance to temptation to come up with

1125
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,280
simple solutions

1126
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,119
to to very complex issues be

1127
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,359
disinformation beat climate

1128
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:15,280
uh economy and so on and so on so

1129
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,720
i believe it's

1130
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,800
it it's not that easy for politics just

1131
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,200
to say okay it's google it's facebook

1132
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,440
and then because us politicians think

1133
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,040
we're responsible carl i want to give

1134
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,560
you the before we go to the last word on

1135
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,160
this but but i'd love to ask you just a

1136
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,760
little twist and particularly with your

1137
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,960
role with the european council on

1138
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,040
formulations i think one of the really

1139
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,640
big questions out there

1140
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,760
is whether in this world of

1141
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,800
disinformation of hybrid conflict there

1142
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,839
has to be deterrence there has to be the

1143
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,680
ability to deploy

1144
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,240
what some are doing to liberal

1145
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,400
democracies and be able to deploy

1146
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,440
that or something else painful to to the

1147
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,880
so-called them

1148
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,960
and i'm just wondering your thoughts on

1149
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,640
the hybrid nature i mean there's

1150
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,240
disinformation that's organic and

1151
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,160
authentic of the kind that yvonne talked

1152
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,319
is also deployed this information so

1153
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,800
your thoughts

1154
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,760
well

1155
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,640
first

1156
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,560
genetically

1157
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,440
i'm skeptical or negative to be precise

1158
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
against governments deciding which

1159
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,280
information i can access

1160
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
i mean we i'm coming from sweden we have

1161
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,800
one of the strongest traditions of

1162
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
freedom of speech

1163
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,079
in our constitution that we find all

1164
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,920
over the world and i think that has

1165
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,200
essentially served us extremely well

1166
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,599
have we had this information well

1167
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,200
i would argue i've been through a couple

1168
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,359
of election campaigns i've lost one i've

1169
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,839
lost some i won some i would say that

1170
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,160
most of the propaganda evil propaganda

1171
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,599
of my political opponents have been

1172
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,440
based on this information that happens

1173
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,079
to be my slightly subjective view and

1174
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,560
they would accuse me of the other the

1175
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,280
other thing i mean what is the truth

1176
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,880
the truth is something that is

1177
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,200
established gradually in a free and open

1178
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,920
society and i do think that this is the

1179
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,560
greatest asset of the west

1180
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,400
taking into consideration that what is

1181
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,480
the truth is often

1182
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,040
not entirely obvious

1183
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,520
and there are different values

1184
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,760
that people have different sort of

1185
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,359
priorities to in different parts of the

1186
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,880
world i mean there's

1187
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,240
talking about sort of the value in the

1188
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,319
our decadent societies and whatever we

1189
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,960
are accused of well well go back a

1190
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,640
couple of decades in our a couple of

1191
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,880
generations in our own societies

1192
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,440
and we were far more conservative when

1193
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,760
it comes to these particular values and

1194
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,920
large part of the orthodox and large

1195
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,400
part of the muslim world are we would

1196
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,880
say behind us

1197
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,040
or far more conservative in their value

1198
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,040
system the confucian value system

1199
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,280
somewhat different what is the truth i

1200
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,240
don't know

1201
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,119
um

1202
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:44,560
and then i've been fighting i've been

1203
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,400
deadly quite a lot with global internet

1204
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,040
issues over the years and fighting in

1205
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,560
the u.n

1206
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,319
against the russians and the chinese and

1207
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,319
the saudis and the iranians because they

1208
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,480
always introduce resolutions in the u.n

1209
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,680
they still do

1210
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,560
calling for information security

1211
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,119
calling for internet sovereignty

1212
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,599
calling for regulation on the global

1213
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:06,839
level of

1214
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,119
information and they are in favor of

1215
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,000
that closed societies are

1216
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,520
and i think it is lethally dangerous if

1217
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,319
our societies go down that particular

1218
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:21,359
path what is then the counter strike

1219
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:23,440
as you said what is the deterrence well

1220
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,359
the deterrence to be slightly simplistic

1221
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:27,280
is the truth

1222
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,960
i remember if you go to prague

1223
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,319
there's this

1224
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:35,280
flag on the top of the ratchin castle

1225
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,240
with the slogan

1226
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,000
truth prevails i think you have the

1227
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,920
local browser

1228
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,000
yeah quite i was always impressed by

1229
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,520
that

1230
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,599
fight

1231
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,400
i wish we should have no i think it's a

1232
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,240
really i just wanted the audience to run

1233
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,280
out of time but i would just simply say

1234
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,640
to you carl that's a very very important

1235
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,920
profound way to look at it but i would

1236
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,400
tell you if i were an african-american

1237
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,000
person for the united states from tulsa

1238
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,680
oklahoma and knew that my grandparents

1239
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,839
had been displaced or killed in the 1921

1240
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,720
tulsa massacre which almost no one knows

1241
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,560
about because it was blotted out from

1242
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,400
american history and until it was

1243
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,079
brought back recently we're all shocked

1244
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,760
and say how were we victims of

1245
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
historical amnesia you know you just

1246
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,680
realize that truth to some people is a

1247
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,680
cartel stacked against them

1248
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,240
uh you know if you are a military family

1249
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,920
that served in the midwest of the united

1250
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,240
states over generations all the wars

1251
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
and you fought in iraq and afghanistan

1252
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,079
your job was shipped off to china you

1253
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,599
know the view they say is we fought all

1254
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,119
these wars we fought the cold war in

1255
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,000
china won so so to a certain degree

1256
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,760
truth is negotiated and that's what's

1257
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,280
going on and we don't have something

1258
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,119
that evolves over time yeah we

1259
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:42,720
reinterpret history all the time i don't

1260
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,079
know the details about the tulsa

1261
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,560
massacre but if if if there have been

1262
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,560
government regulation of information in

1263
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,800
the u.s 20 years ago it would have been

1264
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,440
banned probably right we have a debate

1265
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,280
in certain certain european countries

1266
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,880
have certain traditions right on the

1267
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,040
holocaust that holocaust denial for

1268
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,760
example which is a fairly central issue

1269
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,280
to european history to put it in the

1270
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,400
mindless possible way

1271
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,920
and i've been very much against

1272
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,319
legislation for holocaust denial because

1273
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:15,200
i think holocaust deniers are best

1274
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,920
fought in an open debate and they nearly

1275
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,200
always lose

1276
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,240
while if you send them to the courts

1277
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,319
and send them to prison

1278
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,400
the risk is always they you make victims

1279
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,280
of them

1280
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,760
and the same go back to sort of oh i'm

1281
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,280
old enough to remember this thing called

1282
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,800
the soviet union you might remember it

1283
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,240
yeah um

1284
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
i do they were yamming away i started my

1285
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,920
career studying the soviet union and it

1286
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,920
was not a good choice well it was a good

1287
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,720
choice but sort of it disappeared uh

1288
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,040
yeah your your market value from that

1289
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,960
point of view they were yeah they were

1290
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,040
yamming all of our broadcasts of course

1291
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,400
because they were afraid of the truth we

1292
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,480
never damned anything of them we allowed

1293
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,920
all of the soviet propaganda in our

1294
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,079
respective societies right because it

1295
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,000
was uh it was good to give us a laugh

1296
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,240
now then um and eventually of course

1297
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,800
they lost them we won right it's just

1298
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,440
real short okay yes

1299
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,800
um

1300
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,560
whether we can as you've asked

1301
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,880
come up with some deterrents

1302
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,640
on the level of state

1303
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,480
these of the disinformation

1304
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,960
i'm skeptical too

1305
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,160
but i think

1306
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,920
i'm absolutely certain that it would not

1307
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,160
be possible at all

1308
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,760
unless we

1309
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,040
uh

1310
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,839
provide for more resilient back home

1311
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,680
against that

1312
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,480
and part of it is education right and i

1313
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,440
think in this country i mean how can you

1314
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,760
how can you deal with the you know with

1315
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,760
this information which in my view the

1316
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,319
essence of it it it's not a it's not a

1317
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,160
technical problem it's an entirely

1318
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,400
political problem this information that

1319
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,559
it's right it's a it's a stupid thing to

1320
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,520
believe that you can resolve technically

1321
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:57,599
a political problem and therefore i

1322
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:58,800
think

1323
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,640
we have to make us more resilient back

1324
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,800
home without education right and

1325
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,559
possible without stronger economy

1326
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,640
impossible stronger economy without

1327
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,280
factual reforms impossible because

1328
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,559
result of it

1329
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,440
is that people lost trust into ability

1330
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,599
of state to provide what they expect

1331
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:16,640
from it

1332
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,559
services state i mean education

1333
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,640
education healthcare and so on and so

1334
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,480
and therefore people are looking for

1335
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,359
alternative truth which is then provided

1336
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,119
you know through internet

1337
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,599
through demagogues and and populists

1338
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,839
providing simple simple solutions so

1339
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,839
it's internal resilience well look folks

1340
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,200
i hope you've been enjoying this we went

1341
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,400
a little bit further than i want to but

1342
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,000
i want to take a few questions really

1343
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,839
lightning round no long talks because we

1344
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,280
don't have time so rolling i'm going to

1345
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,800
go to you but real brief let's get a mic

1346
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,119
up here really really brief really brief

1347
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,400
over here

1348
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,670
uh

1349
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:52,110
[Laughter]

1350
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,720
okay

1351
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,400
we haven't mentioned china in 15 minutes

1352
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,599
yeah real brief uh how about try to talk

1353
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,599
about this transatlantic train wreck uh

1354
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:08,000
at the moment and the lack of unity of

1355
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,680
the west you know putting china in the

1356
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,119
middle and not emphasizing our

1357
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,520
differences as europeans

1358
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,839
to the americans about china but but

1359
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,240
emphasizing what we have in common um

1360
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,119
and uh you know if you remember um

1361
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,040
earlier this year when merkel and macron

1362
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,880
went out of their way to emphasize that

1363
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,640
where europe is not going to take part

1364
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,040
in a power struggle between the u.s and

1365
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,440
china and so on yeah you know no

1366
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,640
we're never going to be identified we

1367
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,480
didn't talk about it for 11 minutes

1368
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,040
yeah so i would love to continue but

1369
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,200
okay here over here this is our member

1370
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,319
of parliament uh

1371
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,400
everybody doesn't know this is actually

1372
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,880
a very cool dude

1373
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,160
all right thank you very much uh andre

1374
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
stanczyk thank you for the introduction

1375
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,160
i don't have to do it anymore um my

1376
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,839
question is about regulation of social

1377
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,760
media because it's like a colombo's wife

1378
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,520
everyone keeps talking about her but no

1379
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,200
one has ever seen her

1380
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,760
and my question is that

1381
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,599
you were talking about this information

1382
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,119
and sometimes it's

1383
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,880
blatant lie

1384
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,119
but most of the time they just highlight

1385
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,520
some aspects of reality while neglecting

1386
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,359
the others so they create a very

1387
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:15,920
different narrative from the truth so my

1388
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,240
question is how can we regulate that

1389
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,240
because that there is always going to be

1390
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,920
very i'll take it great successful

1391
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,160
democrats thank you right here i'm just

1392
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,359
going to cluster these because the only

1393
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,078
way we can do it

1394
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,880
thank you very much

1395
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,280
i love this that is political political

1396
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,599
responsibility to change to make the the

1397
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,079
world better but my question is

1398
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,000
do you think that uh now the big

1399
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,040
companies as a facebook and google

1400
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,680
don't become the politician

1401
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,079
okay great hand right here

1402
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,040
and i'm not going to be able to get

1403
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,280
there everyone i apologize but yes nigel

1404
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,760
baker british ambassador to soccer um

1405
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,440
are you having a good time here a lot a

1406
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,520
very great time

1407
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,520
i'm not going to talk about august um

1408
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,599
but um i just wonder whether carl carl

1409
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,680
belts like rather underestimated the

1410
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,599
sort of systemic challenge

1411
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,960
of china

1412
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,119
um the

1413
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,440
china is keen to set the rules in a lot

1414
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,800
of places

1415
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,880
regulatory diplomacy it sounds really

1416
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,839
dry but in space internet many other

1417
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,520
areas there's a real challenge for that

1418
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,800
and i think that's an area where the

1419
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,240
west needs to be marshalling its

1420
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,440
resources shine again i'm going to take

1421
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,720
the lady in the very back

1422
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,000
and then we'll wrap it up

1423
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,520
uh thank you very much georgina wright

1424
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,440
from uh the french think tank i'll teach

1425
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,520
you more i have a

1426
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,359
short question but it might require long

1427
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:39,359
answers we might not have time but one

1428
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,280
of the key problems with misinformation

1429
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,040
is that people have not only become

1430
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,319
anti-political they've become

1431
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:46,640
anti-system and you've touched upon it

1432
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,640
and so they believe the anti-system

1433
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,240
anti-system yeah where they think that

1434
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,680
the government is only serving a

1435
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,599
particular elite they don't believe that

1436
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,839
the state is serving them what do you do

1437
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,520
to restore trust in the system um at

1438
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,599
this time great thank you um so we have

1439
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,119
a set of questions and i'm going to

1440
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,680
start uh with elsa to

1441
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,359
take those that she'd like to respond to

1442
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:09,119
particularly the last one

1443
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,040
okay how do how do we restore trust i

1444
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,800
mean this is i mean we're working hard

1445
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,599
on that and trying hard but i won't also

1446
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:16,720
at the same time because i think the

1447
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,880
same question to also rebound a little

1448
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,240
bit on what was said a little bit

1449
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,280
earlier

1450
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,720
um

1451
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,400
if we and that's based also on your

1452
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,559
question earlier if if we think that

1453
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,280
self-regulation of the of the tech

1454
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,520
companies is going to solve the issue

1455
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,280
we're also missing the democratic

1456
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,720
challenge of accountability to the

1457
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,240
people right the accountability of the

1458
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,680
people is in the government is in the

1459
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,960
parliament

1460
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,640
the question about this information is

1461
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,160
really how do we build resilience in

1462
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,319
society part of it is education indeed

1463
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,119
another part is also about the media and

1464
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,440
civic society who are the ones who are

1465
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,599
supposed to to make advance what is the

1466
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,599
truth so it's how the governments

1467
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:56,480
act

1468
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,960
so that they empower better society to

1469
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,880
fight need some disinformation but

1470
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,720
governments are not out of the picture

1471
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,319
they cannot be because the forces are

1472
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,559
too strong now because technology has

1473
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,800
changed and because the forces behind

1474
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,119
this information that undermine trust

1475
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:12,800
are actually very very strong it's not

1476
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,040
the same ball game as before how do you

1477
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,680
restore first that's this part there's a

1478
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,520
big part about the democratic system

1479
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,839
itself how it's functioning we have a

1480
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,920
little bit underworked i would say the

1481
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,920
democratic system in the past 20 30

1482
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,680
years there are lots of things to do

1483
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,920
about participation representation etc

1484
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,559
and the final one because i really i

1485
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,079
actually think it's the most important

1486
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,480
one is how governments address

1487
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,640
democracies how they address together

1488
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,960
the big challenges that are global where

1489
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,000
they cannot act alone

1490
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,160
that that's for me the most important

1491
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,760
thank you martha

1492
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,520
so i'd like to pick up on on two

1493
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,280
questions one on where is the regulation

1494
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,480
of social media and i think this is

1495
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,319
going to address the question of uh

1496
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,119
whether or not uh tech companies are in

1497
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,079
any shape or form uh political players

1498
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:00,880
so

1499
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,760
um

1500
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,400
top priority regulation of uh eu

1501
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,480
institutions at the moment is uh are two

1502
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,400
acts one of them is digital services act

1503
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,280
another one is digital markets act and

1504
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,839
uh these two are going to profoundly

1505
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:18,000
uh change or shape how uh platforms are

1506
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,559
going to operate that that comes with a

1507
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,800
very long set of new applications

1508
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,880
changes to

1509
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,640
how platforms

1510
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,800
are going to work and this is becoming

1511
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,920
very real we're talking months to

1512
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,680
conclude the process so

1513
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,400
again when you step back from headlines

1514
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,559
and you actually go to a working level

1515
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,960
there is a body of work happening and to

1516
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,480
the question of whether or not we are

1517
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,160
political players the fact that

1518
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,440
companies

1519
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,599
are the subject of this regulation i

1520
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,079
think pretty clearly speaks to

1521
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,400
why we are we should not be considered

1522
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,040
uh political players there's still a lot

1523
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,760
of regulatory scrutiny both in brussels

1524
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,640
capitals uh in europe and

1525
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:07,200
uh washington um dc so um certainly

1526
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,599
no no space for us to have a seat in the

1527
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,440
u.n for now what is google's favorite

1528
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,359
country to operate in

1529
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,880
um slovakia

1530
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,880
carl your thought uh take take take you

1531
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,599
know take your uh pick up questions

1532
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,280
yeah two questions i mean first on the

1533
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,200
regulatory i completely agree i mean the

1534
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,200
chinese are sort of very aggressive i

1535
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,200
don't really blame them uh

1536
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,480
they were coming from nowhere in the

1537
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,000
global economy we set all of the

1538
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,079
standards all of the regulations they

1539
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,079
say we want to be at the table

1540
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,040
and

1541
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,640
fair enough

1542
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,720
that's going to happen but so we need to

1543
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,839
step up the game and it's the entire

1544
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,920
ecosystem of how he said standards

1545
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,760
regulation is a very complex one i've

1546
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:52,319
even sort of shared a report on that for

1547
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,240
a couple of years ago we we need to do

1548
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,559
more right but we can't stop the chinese

1549
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:57,680
they are that

1550
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,040
they are to a certain extent in certain

1551
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,319
of these technologies very very

1552
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:02,000
successful and that needs to be taken

1553
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,119
into account

1554
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,280
the critical question

1555
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,920
how do we restore legitimacy or trust by

1556
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,520
delivery

1557
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,839
by delivering to our citizens if the

1558
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:14,079
chinese are successful or the chinese

1559
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,520
receive i don't know how popular they

1560
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,440
are but it's because they delivered

1561
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,920
economic growth they reduce

1562
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:21,280
poverty

1563
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,160
they

1564
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,240
gave an element of pride to the chinese

1565
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,040
nations after a long time fine we need

1566
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,599
to do the same and there's no reason no

1567
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,960
reason whatsoever

1568
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,799
why open societies and open economy

1569
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,640
should not be able to do better than

1570
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,119
them long term but we need to be proud

1571
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,319
of what we do

1572
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:40,000
and be able to deliver the digital

1573
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,079
transition and the green transition all

1574
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,200
of this it's perfectly doable with some

1575
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,720
sound political leadership thank you um

1576
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,240
yvonne i'm going to give you the last

1577
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,559
word to wrap up all these and and you

1578
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,160
know we it and also there were many

1579
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,680
great questions out here but there was

1580
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,359
uh both roland and the british

1581
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:58,880
ambassadors big question we even put it

1582
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,599
bigger on on how to think through the

1583
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:02,880
china challenge

1584
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,400
and the differentiate i mean what brolin

1585
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,559
said is the differentiation out there

1586
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:09,680
um

1587
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,960
i i take

1588
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,160
a question here from uh a colleague

1589
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,799
she asked whether social platforms are

1590
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,040
or have turned into politicians or

1591
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,359
something like that of course not

1592
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,280
of course not they're not elected but

1593
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:25,520
they do have huge political impact

1594
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,599
they're part of political life in

1595
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,720
addition i dare say

1596
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,119
you know now we are almost

1597
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,640
obsessed and

1598
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,520
and rightly so preoccupied with how to

1599
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,440
regulate them but can

1600
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,359
we say that

1601
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:43,839
uh social platforms

1602
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:44,720
they're

1603
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,720
consequence

1604
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,520
and product of freedom and they are

1605
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,480
making our lives better at the end of

1606
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,040
the day could you imagine how our life

1607
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:57,040
would look like without them so it's not

1608
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,240
only

1609
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,400
about you know looking at the at the

1610
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,880
negative part of it

1611
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,480
and therefore my point is we have to

1612
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,720
have a balanced approach to how to

1613
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,240
regulate them at the end of the day

1614
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,480
because if we overdo that

1615
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,319
then i think we'll lose part of a good

1616
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,040
thing that they're uh they are producing

1617
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,000
and rolling about china i mean we can uh

1618
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,680
we can we can discuss that but that

1619
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,559
would be already beyond the limits of

1620
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,480
of our panel which i found

1621
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,480
very inspiring what it kind of

1622
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,400
yeah incredible conversation i want to

1623
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,599
thank everybody in the audience i wish

1624
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,520
we had gone on could have gone more and

1625
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,280
and you know i just say in terms of an

1626
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,760
element of of humility on our parts

1627
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,200
because sometimes america gets talked

1628
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,480
about too much but this summit for

1629
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,559
democracy which will be coming up and i

1630
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,400
read you know what the state department

1631
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,920
and the white house were saying it about

1632
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,599
you know it's about defending against

1633
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,440
authoritarianism

1634
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,160
we have january 6 to contend with

1635
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,480
fighting corruption we have the

1636
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,920
2008-2000 financial crisis to contend

1637
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,680
with it's raised this interesting

1638
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,000
question that as we sit and promulgate

1639
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,760
and sort of talk to the world about

1640
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,160
aligning democracies how crappy we have

1641
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:06,480
been in america even about maintaining

1642
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,720
our own democratic scaffolding right so

1643
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,480
uh and foundation so i want to just put

1644
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,280
that on the table that this as as as

1645
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,119
elsa said is very very

1646
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,599
uh complicated and difficult but i have

1647
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,200
to tell you that unless we get gravity

1648
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,559
to go in the right direction in these

1649
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,960
ways and unless we make it easier over

1650
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,599
time that that's the natural default

1651
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,040
i think we have some real problems so i

1652
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,480
really appreciate everyone's candor i

1653
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,760
want to thank

1654
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,799

00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,079
you know again on the 10th anniversary

1664
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,839
of the talk for summit congratulations

1665
00:59:53,839 --> 00:59:56,160
for developing this fantastic forum

1666
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,558
the floor is yours

1667
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,520
thank you stephen and and of course it's

1668
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,200
a teamwork it's not about one person

1669
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:06,720
it's about all of us working together

1670
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,680
and enjoying this time together so i

1671
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,880
always have this

1672
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,960
very difficult task to try to summarize

1673
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,880
a very rich discussion that we had

1674
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,960
yesterday today uh come up with some

1675
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,599
conclusions uh so please bear with me

1676
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,359
for about five ten minutes and i'll try

1677
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,040
to do it i would start with some

1678
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,280
statistics i think numbers they always

1679
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,720
talk for themselves so we had about 250

1680
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,680
guests from 50 from 20 countries 20

1681
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,839
countries so i think quite a quite an

1682
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,839
achievement during this still kind of

1683
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,160
post covey time

1684
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,640
we had about 50 percent of

1685
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,960
this number from business community so

1686
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,319
it's a great achievement because we're

1687
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,280
always

1688
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,520
trying to create a truly public private

1689
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,200
platform and this is this is very

1690
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,880
important that we have both sides public

1691
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,680
and private coming together three seven

1692
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,960
speakers

1693
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,599
33 focus group speakers seven young

1694
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,920
professionals actually if they are here

1695
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,359
i would like to welcome them we have

1696
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,720
this wonderful program for young

1697
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,640
professionals from europe as part of

1698
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,160
globsec and it's great that they can

1699
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,720
participate with us in in these

1700
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,960
discussions and 20 journalists i think

1701
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,680
also very important that we have media

1702
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,240
uh some interesting facts uh as you

1703
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,280
already know this was the 10th

1704
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,280
anniversary so we are getting to next

1705
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,760
decade of uh tatra summit and i think

1706
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,160
this is uh this is wonderful for the

1707
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,079
first time we had a special train

1708
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,520
globsec train which brought many

1709
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:30,160
participants here and i suppose the

1710
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,839
minister of transport of slovakia and he

1711
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:33,680
promised that next year it will be again

1712
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,559
a train ready to be uh to come to come

1713
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,040
to tatara summit as well

1714
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,280
we sometimes we are here in this

1715
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,799
beautiful environment and we are not

1716
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,480
thinking about the world kind of around

1717
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,359
us but actually we were uh we reached

1718
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:50,559
over 50 000 people by social media i

1719
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,880
think also very nice

1720
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,440
uh the most viewed was the first panel

1721
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,400
uh the introductory panel and we had uh

1722
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,799
over 100

1723
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,599
unique viewers from 35 countries

1724
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,839
so i think this is a great achievement

1725
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:07,359
maybe one area where we should get

1726
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:09,839
better this is gender balance

1727
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:13,039
we have uh 35 female

1728
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,880
65 males so this is something we will

1729
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:17,520
certainly work on and make it better

1730
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,920
so some of the statistics but more

1731
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,000
importantly about substance i think we

1732
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,640
had very very rich substance as you know

1733
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,359
the title of the of this tatra summit

1734
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,480
was

1735
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,680
european economy rebuilt after

1736
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:35,200
after covet and how we do it better

1737
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,440
i think when we look at where we were

1738
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,079
one year ago at the tetra summit we're

1739
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:42,160
expecting or we're worrying what it will

1740
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,039
be like in one year what 2021 will look

1741
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:47,200
like there were different uh negative

1742
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,160
scenarios uh what we may have crisis

1743
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,559
unemployment companies especially small

1744
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,720
medium enterprises collapsing etc

1745
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,319
actually we don't see it i think the

1746
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,240
picture is very nice i mean european

1747
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,760
economy is growing globally we are in

1748
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,960
very good shape

1749
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,760
so

1750
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,359
this is wonderful and this is an

1751
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:05,680
opportunity to rebuild in in a better

1752
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,559
way and this was the focus of today's of

1753
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,400
discussion yesterday and today

1754
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,720
we have also massive financial support

1755
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,160
uh probably the biggest in european

1756
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,200
history

1757
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,200
supported by the eu next generation

1758
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,920
funds by the resilience funds by the

1759
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,480
accommodative fiscal policy very low

1760
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,480
interest rates i mean all this is really

1761
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,640
wonderful and great opportunity for

1762
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,960
governments for countries of europe and

1763
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,280
in this region to invest and invest

1764
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:33,039
especially into innovation and i think

1765
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,880
this is one of the main

1766
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,480
main messages

1767
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,559
you know how we do it how we rebuild and

1768
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,799
this is by supporting innovation without

1769
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,640
innovation europe but also and in

1770
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,160
particular this region cannot be

1771
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,240
competitive and cannot

1772
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,160
grow into the region which is good for

1773
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,839
the people so they can stay here

1774
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,520
especially young people and don't have

1775
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,760
to find opportunities outside

1776
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,039
i think there was agreement that there

1777
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:57,200
are two primary pillars

1778
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:58,400
for this

1779
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,280
innovating innovation

1780
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,119
approach this is in line with the eu

1781
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:05,119
strategy so it's green and sustainable

1782
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,319
economy on one hand and digitalization

1783
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:12,160
i think that was a very good discussion

1784
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:13,359
about uh

1785
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,280
how to support the innovation by

1786
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,839
supporting uh disruptive technologies

1787
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,520
disruptive technologies is something

1788
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,520
that has to driven us and i would say

1789
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,359
that uh we should focus especially on

1790
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,599
those technologies which can be scaled

1791
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,760
up to the infrastructure level and on

1792
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,599
the cross-border level and i think this

1793
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,680
is a great opportunity also for for this

1794
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,599
region whether we are talking about the

1795
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,359
battery value chains based on

1796
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:37,680
sustainable approach so-called c2c as

1797
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,559
tara calls it from cradle to cradle from

1798
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,359
the production uh mining production to

1799
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,920
recycling or

1800
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,920
using microchips innovative microchips

1801
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,440
to support data storage centers with

1802
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,160
energy and energy reductions so these

1803
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,480
are all opportunities which we have to

1804
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,839
utilize

1805
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,200
um

1806
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,039
energy transformation engine

1807
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,400
transmission transition was a big

1808
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,559
subject also because of the

1809
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:06,640
huge increase of prices for electricity

1810
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,799
for gas

1811
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,160
i think this is a

1812
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,880
also result of the major changes we see

1813
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,440
as we know the um those elements which

1814
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,160
provide in the energy system base load

1815
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:21,039
production which are very much based on

1816
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,839
fossil fuel whether it's coal gas etc

1817
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:25,359
these are decreasing as part of the

1818
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:28,160
decomposition the carbonization process

1819
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,079
the renewables which are intermittent

1820
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:31,839
are increasing and this of course

1821
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,319
creates this uh sometimes this

1822
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,480
equilibrium in the energy system it's

1823
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,920
part of the transfer transformation

1824
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,880
process i think the big question for

1825
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,480
europe will be whether we are going to

1826
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,960
deal with this issue this increase of

1827
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,119
prices by

1828
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,200
i would say reducing our efforts

1829
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,280
of moving towards the carbonization or

1830
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,119
rather increasing and speeding up the

1831
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:54,799
carbonization and i hope it will be the

1832
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,799
latter one because this is the only way

1833
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,400
forward

1834
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,799
one issue which was also mentioned by

1835
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,880
everybody and where we have to

1836
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,039
do much more our skills

1837
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:07,520
and education education is the necessary

1838
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,160
component for pro-innovative environment

1839
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,319
and unfortunately central eastern europe

1840
01:06:12,319 --> 01:06:14,400
this region is falling behind it's a

1841
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,720
huge problem we have to really

1842
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,160
we have to really focus on this

1843
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,400
innovation has to be supported i think

1844
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,240
this was also a very important message

1845
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,720
that this region unfortunately is does

1846
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,079
not provide enough support for

1847
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:30,640
innovative companies and we need

1848
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,799
policies which would uh support

1849
01:06:32,799 --> 01:06:34,640
innovation innovative companies which

1850
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,799
will also be able to transform the huge

1851
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,319
amount of money which is coming from

1852
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,160
different public sources to

1853
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,559
support for for such companies

1854
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,200
and uh last but not least i think for me

1855
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,200
one of the major initiatives and

1856
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,079
probably that we could call this uh

1857
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,880
this tatra summit number 10 is the

1858
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,640
danube tech valley

1859
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,079
i think there was a general agreement

1860
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,799
that this cross-border regional approach

1861
01:06:58,799 --> 01:07:00,720
is the way how the relatively small

1862
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,200
economies of this region can multiply

1863
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:05,920
and maximize their opportunity to to be

1864
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,200
a uh innovative and uh competitive part

1865
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,359
of of europe and global economy and i

1866
01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:12,480
think it's very important we have this

1867
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,359
wonderful example of uh arkhani dopken

1868
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:17,839
where he had to build his huge company

1869
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,359
in the united states and i think our

1870
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,039
challenge is to make sure that people

1871
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,440
like arkady can do it in the region

1872
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,079
itself and this is for me the main focus

1873
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,599
of the danube tango

1874
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:29,440
and this is where also glob service the

1875
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,359
governments of the region will be will

1876
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:32,720
be working on

1877
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,839
so

1878
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:36,319
um what to do next

1879
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,000
i think we need to improve on gender

1880
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,319
balance which will do also we need more

1881
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:42,640
people more representatives from uh

1882
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:44,480
real economy especially from the new

1883
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,720
economy from the high-tech and digital

1884
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,359
companies i think if we want to discuss

1885
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,760
innovation we need more input from from

1886
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:53,200
those people

1887
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,359
and last but not least i would like to

1888
01:07:55,359 --> 01:07:57,280

getting to know each other i i do

1924
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,640
believe that the informal part of tatara

01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,880
summit is at least as valued as the

1926
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,198
formal part and discussions and

1927
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:29,439
