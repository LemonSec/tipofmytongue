i'd like to tell you about the man about

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,879
the story

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,640
which is probably

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,960
a very important story for all of us

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,800
interested in or coming from central and

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,079
eastern europe

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,680
and we have started these business

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,879
awards

24
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,039
robert how many years ago probably three

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,719
years ago yes

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
and then we did the first one we we said

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
and sorry arkady it's not about a man

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,000
it's about the message

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
so

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
the first message we we celebrated uh

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,200
awarded andreas trejo

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
at the time the ceo of saban and we said

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
but there is a message

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,840
he was

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,320
the one who probably did most in the

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,720
region to create a wide and stable

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
middle class which is the basis of any

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
democracy but

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,759
back to the business awards

40
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,920
this year we are going to

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,360
celebrate something different this

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,439
year's award is about entrepreneurship

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,759
entrepreneurship out of this region and

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,560
uh

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,159
when i when i think about an

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,399
enterprising the easiest definition of

47
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,119
who is an entrepreneur it is someone who

48
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,320
does something out of nothing

49
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,520
and that's what we are going to

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,159
celebrate tonight and that should be

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,600
a message to the whole of the region

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,960
every

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,040
business award every award given

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,840
is usually not qualified by those who

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,720
give the award but those who receive it

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,959
so we are always very careful to pick

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
the right person to give a strong

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,959
message

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,920
so

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,160
we chose a person

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,520
who

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,160
at a very young age just beyond 30

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,920
immediately after the soviet union

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,239
collapsed decided to

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,879
move to the united states

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,560
moved to the united states in 1993

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,120
arrived with very little money

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
he said that he he ran out of money

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,000
after buying his first used car

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,640
with a small child to take care of

71
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,480
he didn't speak english

72
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,239
well he understood he could read english

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,519
but he didn't understand really

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
especially american english

75
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,159
and

76
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,159
he spent the first months

77
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,000
first four months

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,319
dishwashing in restaurants and sending

79
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,840
out job interviews 400 job applications

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,000
uh in those years

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,200
in those months

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
until somebody

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,640
very american story

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,519
uh

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,360
took him without the proper knowledge of

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
english and offered him a job so that's

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,200
how he started in 1993

88
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,519
and he was uh considered to be a crazy

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,040
guy coming from

90
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,760
then belo russia post soviet belarusia

91
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,239
going around and saying

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,680
he has a vision that belorussia

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,840
is the place in the former soviet union

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,440
where there was a concentration of

95
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,720
engineers

96
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,080
and software

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,519
experts

98
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,040
who

99
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,840
who can do miracle

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,799
and

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,560
let me put some parenthesis here for

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
policymakers mr prime minister and your

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
government members here

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,319
think about how

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,720
the heritage of the soviet union the

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,720
engineering and software knowledge was

107
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
concentrated in one small area in the

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
country so when we think about education

109
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,799
today when we think about creating

110
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,599
clusters or when we talk about

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,439
the danube tech valley which is the

112
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,040
latest uh initiative of of globsec and i

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,280
understand slovakia and

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
maybe other countries in the region soon

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
we are trying to recreate that cluster

116
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,800
that knowledge base that can elevate

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,520
this region out of out of

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,680
being the cheap labor source

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
but going back to the story of a man the

120
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,800
entrepreneur who in 1993

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
started a company

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,280
with three employees

123
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,919
one in the united states if i understand

124
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,960
correctly and the rest in in minsk

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
and then

126
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,280
i cut the rest of the short story short

127
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,800
epam

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,720
systems today is present in 35 countries

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,560
it has close to 50 000 employees

130
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,600
about

131
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
thirty thousand is in the broader

132
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,800
central and eastern europe

133
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
it has annual revenues of two point

134
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,320
three billion dollars

135
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,479
and its market cap if i looked at the

136
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:11,520
last

137
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
the last page

138
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,680
of

139
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,120
yahoo finance it was around 33 billion

140
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
dollars

141
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,080
creating something out of nothing what

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,600
could be a better

143
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
example of entrepreneurship

144
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,080
so

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
i think

146
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,479
the

147
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,880
there is a message in this award today

148
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
not just about the man himself who we

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
are going to give this heavy glass piece

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,560
of glass in a minute

151
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
but

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
that it is possible

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,520
to create something of out of nothing

154
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,639
you could say that rkg dopken lived the

155
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,880
american dream

156
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,520
but i remember in 1990 when the war

157
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,720
collapsed

158
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,800
my generation believed that this is the

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,919
central

160
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,919
eastern european dream that we can do

161
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,080
something out of nothing that we can be

162
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
better than those in the west we can be

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
faster we can we can

164
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,319
accelerate and get there or even

165
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,039
overtake them

166
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,000
that was the central eastern european

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,039
dream and 30 years later many of us are

168
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,479
a bit more born a bit more old and need

169
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,560
glasses and

170
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,240
quite a few of us are quite skeptical

171
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,600
about this dream

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
but that is why

173
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
awards are needed that is why we need to

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,160
celebrate lifetime achievements and this

175
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
is why i'd like to ask arkady dobkin to

176
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
come to this stage take the award and

177
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,639
tell us how he's made it

178
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,840
thank you very much

179
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,759
i think everything should

180
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,199
go in turn so it was a funny message and

181
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
serious message should be funny now

182
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,960
again right

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,560
uh

184
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,919
and i i'm just so much impressed how

185
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,560
well prepared gordon i don't think i

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,440
shared this with you or at least

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,120
in this details because it seems like

188
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
was good preparation there

189
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
uh as usual with some mistakes but it's

190
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,360
that's fine

191
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,520
i'm really on serious note i'm very

192
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,479
honored and humble

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,520
because as you know in life everything

194
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,440
coming with a lot of luck and i was very

195
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,960
lucky guy

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,639
because

197
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,360
it's happened to me that i was in my

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
early 30s or

199
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,759
late 20s when gerbachev came

200
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,680
and that was a turning point for

201
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
everything and suddenly you understand

202
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,840
that you can do something different

203
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,440
and i was forced out of

204
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,599
my country by my family because they saw

205
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,000
that the window is one month and if

206
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
you're not living and i actually left in

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,120
91 right after the pooch if you remember

208
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,039
what was it

209
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,879
and

210
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,199
so i was lucky because i was a product

211
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,120
of soviet union educational system

212
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
which was good

213
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,160
good sites which is like my engineering

214
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
background

215
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
and happened to me very good side

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,958
because i had no idea how to speak in

217
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,039
english which means that in america

218
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,360
nobody was going to was was going to

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,839
employ me and i had to start the company

220
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,440
and also i very quickly understand and

221
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,600
that's important for this forum which

222
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,760
again i had no idea happening

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,680
until

224
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,839
gordon contacted me several weeks ago

225
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
back then i realized that talent is

226
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,560
really global and i knew so many smart

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,440
people from my university from my

228
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,519
first software company which i started

229
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,839
back in belarus

230
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,320
right one

231
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
was possible and i thought how

232
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,920
come it

233
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
would be possible to connect and

234
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,519
remember 20 92 93 no internet available

235
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,399
so it was just a crazy idea when i

236
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,440
called my school friend and said let's

237
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
let's do it

238
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
he was number 10 in the list

239
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,079
everybody else told me that i'm crazy

240
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,519
and all we wanted to prove that actually

241
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,959
the talent

242
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,399
which we know

243
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,279
at this point from belarus would be able

244
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,160
to help doing something

245
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,399
good for the world and actually accept

246
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,720
it as a people with talented abilities

247
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
and then it happens that we become

248
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,120
relatively visible in belarus

249
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,160
and then i was looking how to grow and

250
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,079
compete with

251
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,160
global companies and was trying to

252
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
do some acquisitions

253
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,440
with our own

254
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,399
peanuts money and the only company which

255
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,399
agreed to do it with us was company in

256
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,160
hungary

257
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,839
in

258
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,279
2004 and we become

259
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,839
the company which kind of switch broken

260
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,399
english slash russian to

261
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,079
components of hungarian accent

262
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,279
so

263
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,959
i was like you also that in 2012

264
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,760
when we already had 7 000 people

265
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,439
and ukraine and russia

266
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,839
and hungary budapest was our

267
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,760
european uh connection we had no idea

268
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,079
what is ipo but we did apo new york

269
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,800
stock exchange with one lawyer in states

270
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
and two finance people

271
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,120
if i knew that it shouldn't be possible

272
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,800
we never would be doing this and it was

273
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,760
very bad ipo

274
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,880
because it was strange company with

275
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,200
strange accent and everything but then

276
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,720
we were

277
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
quarter after quarter we're proving that

278
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,320
we can

279
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,519
work and 10 years later this is where we

280
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,480
are and gordon mentioned 2.3 it's

281
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,720
actually 2.6 last year and this year it

282
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,079
would be 3.6 at least

283
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
and the whole point that we were

284
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,560
proving each time that if you

285
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,200
hungry enough and humble and people

286
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,640
smart and this is from one of the

287
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
business book

288
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
but it's really simple categorization

289
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,320
what should be there

290
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,560
without hungering is nothing happen you

291
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,719
need to want to make happen

292
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,040
don't be serious about it

293
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,519
and

294
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,079
now we're one of the

295
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,880
top global companies in our world

296
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,920
now exchanging deloitte and ibm watching

297
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,639
us very very careful because we are the

298
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
fastest growing software technology

299
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,880
services company in the world

300
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
and we have actually 40 000 people

301
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,240
across eastern central europe

302
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,600
about 10 actually across hungary poland

303
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,839
romania czech republic

304
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,560
we just started in slovakia several

305
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,920
months ago

306
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,720
uh bulgaria and i probably missed

307
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,040
something and clearly we still in our

308
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
roots and

309
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,360
we

310
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
really american company

311
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
with five percent of our people in

312
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,120
america

313
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
with 60 percent of business there but we

314
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,959
serve in practically everybody and we

315
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,320
prove into the world that the talent

316
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,160
from here can do anything and company

317
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,680
from here can do anything and i think

318
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,600
there are a lot of companies which

319
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,160
really was using us as a

320
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
aspiration and i hope that it would be

321
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,079
happening and i hope that you still will

322
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,719
be aspiration
