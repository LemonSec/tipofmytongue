1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,920
the most important thing are actually

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,280
the debates and the and the site

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,519
meetings you know the corridor talks

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,279
that is really what makes

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,720
this kind of conference a success

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,599
this environment really

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,160
really enables the kind of behind the

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,880
scenes informal discussions between

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
public and private sector

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
between the visiting delegations from

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
all across the cee region it's a

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,680
fantastic space where you can exchange

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,239
ideas have high level dialogues but also

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,079
really get into the weeds of the the

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,320
issues at hand and seek collaboration

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,000
opportunities

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,760
i have been here since practically the

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,079
beginning and there is always a crisis

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,840
that we are discussing every year so

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
crisis is not unknown to the

21
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,680
participants of tantra summit but what

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,760
is special is that the representatives

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,479
of business science research and

24
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,080
government can meet here in a very

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,479
intimate environment and talk honest and

26
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,479
serious and sometimes very pointed and

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,320
critical about what should be done

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,080
as we enter the post-covet recovery it's

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,880
very important to improve things

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,280
this region is very fortunate to have

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,840
access to the eu funding and it's

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,159
important to spend the money well

33
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,799
and that's why it's useful to talk about

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,960
a range of topics from

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,840
electric grids and investments that are

36
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,960
needed to empower movement of women and

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,200
just transition

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,119
i think it's especially important for

39
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,200
this region because we don't have that

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,159
long history of stakeholders building

41
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
trust and interacting on a regular basis

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,960
so i think these regular forums are

43
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
super important for that especially as

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
we face multiple challenges which will

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
be very difficult to solve just by

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,520
ourselves so we need better

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
public-private partnerships but for that

48
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,040
we need these interactions we need to

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200
build trust we need to build mutual

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,479
understanding

51
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,840
and also just

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,480
potential collaborations that are

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,640
thinking outside the box and trying out

54
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,120
new pilot projects that involve many

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,200
many different stakeholders

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,280
we're facing critical choices ahead of

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,920
us major elections have taken place or

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,520
will be taking place in the coming year

59
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,480
and so we really need to take stock

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
while we've learned over the last

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
year that it's possible to do quite a

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,800
lot remotely

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,879
nothing beats facetime and tatra summit

64
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,200
has been a fantastic opportunity to to

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,319
catch up

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,720
and to dive deeper on beyond what you

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,840
can achieve in a zoom call

68
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,679
you
