1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,960
Trying to bring solutions to real problems

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,000
is what GLOBSEC is about.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,600
This hybrid way of doing things,

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,680
this is the way of the future.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,080
And I think you saw it play out

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,360
in 3D form here in real time.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,280
What I find here,

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,120
is that it’s not just an academic exercise,

9
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,440
you have a lot of creative and concrete formats

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,360
that are very interesting, like Focus Group.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,759
I sense that this is really a platform we need

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,480
It, of course, has a focus on Central and Eastern Europe,

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,519
which for me – living in Berlin

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,160
is very valuable to understand

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,599
what’s happening in this part of Europe

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,520
and of course it has a broader perspective

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,480
so it helps me understand Europe  

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,239
in a much broader context.

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,239
I think there is a real sense,

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,320
and there is a real understanding

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,880
that things can not go back to how they were

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,280
COVID is only going to drive faster

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
towards the types of investments, 

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,560
that we need to make in digital economy, digitalisation,

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,040
in automotive, in energy efficiency

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,560
and even tackling the climate change.

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,160
I am optimistic, because

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,640
I believe you always have a choice

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,920
Look, this is unprecedented crisis, 

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,080
but this is not the first crisis the EU 

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,399
and the European continent has been experiencing.

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,320
This is the moonshot opportunity for the EU

33
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,759
to actually combine the recovery and reconstruction

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,160
with a leap into the future sustainable technologies.

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,399
The recent recovery plan

36
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,320
is contributing to the resilience of the European Union

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,360
in that creating some common fiscal capacity in Europe

38
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,040
even though only temporary and for a specific purpose

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,080
is a step in a direction of resilience.  

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
This is the million dollar question.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,679
How decision makers in Central and Eastern Europe

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,600
and all over the Europe see the recovery 

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,440
the banks as well as governments

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,679
as well as the industries.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,960
We need to take fast action

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,119
and we need to mobilise. 

47
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,680
But the way we should really mobilise

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,720
is to give the opportunity to the businesses.

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,320
The companies that will be the most successful,

50
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,880
in today’s and tomorrow digital economy

51
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,960
will be those that can digitalise.

52
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,840
And for that we need to create an environment

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,320
that enables that, in Europe, especially.

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,320
And one thing when you’re looking at innovation

55
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,440
or in terms of technology and digitalisation 

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,760
or the green economy

57
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,640
is that you are going to fail – so embrace it.

58
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,280
I think the EU could use trade policy more,

59
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,000
to on the one hand support social standards agenda 

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,280
and also the environmental standards agenda,

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,880
these are two important things.

62
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,120
I think this is an opportunity to get prepared

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,040
and to actually mobilise everything what we need to mobilise

64
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,959
to face climate crisis

65
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,840
and maybe prevent it with energy transition.

66
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,520
The one thing, that pandemic is teaching us

67
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,680
is the solution is only possible together.
