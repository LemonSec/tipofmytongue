1
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,680
do

2
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,199
well welcome back to the afternoon

3
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,840
sessions here at the tatra summit if you

4
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,919
missed uh eleanor's session with the

5
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,000
central bank governors let me just give

6
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,160
you a few takeaways to set the stage for

7
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,240
this next conversation

8
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
they've said that policy response needs

9
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
to be tailored to each crisis you can't

10
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
look you know take away from previous

11
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,120
crises

12
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
that's a pretty obvious given there from

13
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,919
them disagreement about what actually is

14
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,720
a united approach holds up even today

15
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,680
and that policy is a blunt tool you

16
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,479
can't use it for everything you cannot

17
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,960
paint broad brushes with it this

18
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
afternoon we're kicking off this section

19
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,319
of the program talking about the

20
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,960
strategic transformation of the cee the

21
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,880
uh session will be led by sonia

22
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,360
mazikarova chief economist at globe

23
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,080
sacks policy institute but before i get

24
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
there i want to take the opportunity to

25
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,160
highlight the 2021 globe sec

26
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,919
transformation index that she and her

27
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,199
team have created it is a fantastic

28
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
quantitative tool and really addresses

29
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,199
some of the issues you've heard through

30
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,560
the afternoon

31
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
the index measures strategic

32
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
transformation in the cee last year

33
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,199
it ranks nine countries on macro

34
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
fundamentals resilience education

35
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,400
digital and green transitions and the

36
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,199
capacity to innovate most importantly

37
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,199
now some of the results that sonia and

38
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,199
her team have come up with show that the

39
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,759
top performers are austria slovenia and

40
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,080
the czech republic followed by poland

41
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
and hungary with the slovak republic

42
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,400
coming in number six

43
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
but the crux of the report is that most

44
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,000
countries have been resilient but their

45
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,240
shortcomings in the macro model have

46
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,479
really grown but this is the cool thing

47
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,039
about the index it provides policy

48
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,080
makers with a diagnostic map of weak and

49
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,080
strong areas of policy so if anybody

50
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
needed guidance it's

51
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
pretty much sitting in here so pick up

52
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,639
one of these it is going to feed into a

53
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
number of conversations that you will

54
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
have over the next coming months

55
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,879
and years to say the least especially

56
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,080
because i understand sonia this is going

57
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,639
to be done every single year

58
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,080
based on this year's results i want to

59
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,160
leave you with this slovenia poland and

60
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
austria exhibit the strongest education

61
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,319
outcomes austria croatia and slovenia

62
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,879
are closest to the greening frontier the

63
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,879
czech republic austria and slovenia

64
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,759
remain the top digital performers and

65
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,479
austria and slovenia demonstrate the

66
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,520
most advanced innovation economy so you

67
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,919
know where the cee countries stand at

68
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,039
this point here's the flip side bulgaria

69
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,440
was found to need work on its external

70
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
resilience and productivity

71
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,159
that's across the board overall croatia

72
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
needs to work on improving its financial

73
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
fundamentals and the weakest structural

74
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,519
areas for slovakia are education and the

75
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
capacity to innovate

76
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,279
it's a pretty easy tool to use it

77
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,440
provides a breadth of information

78
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,200
like i mentioned before this this

79
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
afternoon you'll find them laid across

80
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,360
the hotel so do pick up one of these

81
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
books i'm now going to hand you into the

82
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680
very very safe hands of the woman who

83
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
let this be possible for us to figure

84
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
out this information sonia i'm going to

85
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
give it to you to take this conversation

86
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,839
forward from that report thank you very

87
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,680
much all right i think we're ready

88
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,480
all right so uh again thank you very

89
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,120
much maitreya for this uh generous

90
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,279
summary of the main findings of the

91
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,959
report and

92
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,880
first and foremost good afternoon

93
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
excellent season ladies and gentlemen

94
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
we have about 40 minutes to discuss the

95
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
strategic recovery of the sea region and

96
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,200
how this plays out with a so-called

97
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,760
k-shaped recovery which we will debunk

98
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,399
with our great panel today

99
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,040
just to offer some contextual background

100
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
for this discussion

101
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640
the previous panel with the three

102
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,120
governors recounted what monetary policy

103
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
has done for us and how it needs to

104
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
better coordinate with fiscal policy

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,800
to forge a robust recovery now i would

106
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
like to take a step back and uh talk

107
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,279
about fiscal policy because in many

108
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,000
respects fiscal policy is the new kid on

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,640
the block it really has been fully

110
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
deployed since the pandemic has landed

111
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,600
and before the pandemic it was monetary

112
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,560
policy doing a lot of the heavy lifting

113
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,160
and i'd like to explore three main

114
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,640
facets here with respect to

115
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,279
fiscal policy the first one is

116
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,880
effectiveness

117
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
these fiscal stimuli rolled out really

118
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,720
have been massive by historical

119
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
standards

120
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,240
and i want to explore with our panel

121
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
really how effective they have been in

122
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,360
putting the floor beneath the crisis the

123
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
second aspect is on

124
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
perhaps

125
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,959
thinking about or starting uh rolling

126
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,720
some of this support back

127
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,279
in the in the current climate of a

128
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
robust rebound

129
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,760
and the robust activity that we see in

130
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
trade and manufacturing

131
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,000
and the third aspect is the k-shape

132
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,640
recovery dynamics so the fact that this

133
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,200
um pandemic has created winners and

134
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,519
losers across sectors across regions

135
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,480
across countries and how does that fit

136
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
into the

137
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,320
future course of policy so before we get

138
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,959
down to business i'd like to finally um

139
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,200

so without fur uh further ado um we have

156
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,200
these massive stimuli rolled out right

157
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,480
they were pretty robust and

158
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
indiscriminate by even historical

159
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
standards and based on the incoming

160
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,279
information that we have the declaration

161
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,160
of bankruptcy bankruptcies um have been

162

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
2021

164
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,360

165
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
non-performing loans all across the

166
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,320
board

167
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,959
and we have even seen some new business

168
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,360
creation which is pretty spectacular for

169
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,760
a crisis like this so i'd like to start

170

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,320
maybe bring us up to speed as to what

172
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,760
instruments have been rolled out in

173
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
slovakia and perhaps the region and

174
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,360
which ones do you

175
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
deem most effective in putting the floor

176
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,160
beneath this crisis

177
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
thank you very much

178
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,040

maybe i will start with the

180
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
k

181
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,800
shaped recovery as the title of this

182
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,920
panel is

183
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,680
and

184
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,920
in the first round as the glopstick

185
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,760
today started there was a question who's

186
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,079
here for the first time and my hand was

187
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,279
up because

188
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,040
i'm here for the first time and when

189
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
when i'm doing something for first time

190
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,639
i try to prepare properly and and i

191
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639

192
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,480
three four days ago

193
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,360
and

194
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,240
i thought aloud is good we have k-shaped

195
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
econo recovery it means some industries

196
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,959
are recovering

197
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,360
biotech

198
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,639
e-commerce

199
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,440
uh i don't know uh all them and the

200
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,560
other ones

201
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,519
are performing poorer it's culture uh

202
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,920
tourism and so on and so on

203
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,560
how does it fit with today when mark

204
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,720
zuckerberg lost six billions

205
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,160
his facebook

206
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,440

you know them that

210
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,519
google wikipedia

211
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,639
internet and facebook met

212
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,600
and

213
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,000
each of them made statements so buddies

214
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,399
facebook told i know everybody

215
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,360
yeah

216
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,800
nice

217
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
google i can find everything

218
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,680
nice wikipedia

219
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,760
i know everything

220
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,440
an internet

221
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
i have it all

222
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,720
and in the corner in the dark corner

223
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,040
there was a fifth body and historian

224
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:13,920
yeah

225
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,519
keep talking buddies keep talking who

226
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,639
was that

227
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,680
energy

228
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
and you know the energy is the key

229
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,279
where the next crisis started uh two

230
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,760
three weeks ago and the price is spiking

231
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,800
therefore for me it was a remark

232
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
where we all

233
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,880
we thought or learned a lesson from the

234
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,639
pandemic crisis that

235
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,440
we still have to be

236
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,079
humiliated or the humility before all

237
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,320
the actions taken

238
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,440
and

239
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,120
all the

240
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
points

241
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,160
our activities

242
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
shall be covered by

243
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,839
for me humanity humility and hard work

244
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,000
it was a great idea of prime minister in

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the first panel that between the

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,519
opportunity

247
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,600
and the success there is a hard work and

248
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,839
this is what we have to do and coming

249
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,680
back to uh to your uh question yeah

250
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
we

251
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,720
this the government

252
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,680
of slavic republic in 2020 in march come

253
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,120
with

254
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
full of enthusiasm to the role

255
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,240
and

256
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
immediately was caught

257
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
by by the pandemic

258
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,760
issue and

259
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,160
almost nothing was prepared here i mean

260
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
in germany there was a 120 pages of

261
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,680
pandemic plan here it was zero page

262
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,600
prepared so

263
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,720
we started from a zero based

264
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,279
level and in two weeks there was a

265
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,560
request from

266
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,839
from

267
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,199
many sites

268
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,880
please implement

269
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,480
short term work scheme i mean the

270
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
courser by that was already mentioned

271
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,959
i'm asking well

272
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,560
where are the basics

273
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
yeah we presented it four years ago to

274
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,079
the government but nothing is

275
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,639
implemented yeah and you want us now in

276
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,800
two weeks to have it implemented and we

277
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,759
did it

278
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,839
and you know that we implement the

279
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,880
shorter work scheme in two weeks from

280
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,959
the beginning and now we have already

281
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,120
implemented shorthand work as a

282
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
long-term scheme starting with january

283
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,959
1st

284
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,720
next year and so coming to your question

285
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,800
out of the three billions

286
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,040
which this year slavic republic

287
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,839
budget is spending on on covet

288
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,560
expenditures recovery expenditures and

289
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,759
mitigation of all the losses uh half of

290
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,839
this

291
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,959
1.45 billions

292
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,360
is the short term working

293
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
scheme

294
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,240
and it helps a lot

295
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,839
it's definitely

296
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,079
worked perfectly so

297
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,959
the

298
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:49,759
the losses on the

299
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,880
employment side were mitigated to very

300
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,720
low level up to

301
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,600
0.3 percent and are already recovering

302
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
so this was one of the

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,559
one of the most important

304
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,799
measures the second one was even huger

305
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,079
coming up to 1.6

306
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,039
billions and this is the banking schemes

307
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,679
we have implemented two schemes one

308
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,039
scheme is the

309
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,640
guaranteed loans so we started with new

310
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,760
loans

311
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,559
with with a state guarantee up to 80 or

312
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,400
90 percent and the other one scheme was

313
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,240
the liquidity injection in form of

314
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,200
postponements of installments

315
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,320
and both worked perfectly so this was

316
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,080
liquidity booster

317
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,000
huge liquidity booster

318
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,720
to the overall economy and

319
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,200
it works very effectively and

320
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
efficiently

321
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,240
generally

322
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,679
effectiveness

323
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,600
has to be seen

324
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,360
with with the eyes of

325
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,960
2020 2020 and at that time the the more

326
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,480
more important

327
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,360
than to be effective down to the last

328
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,559
euro it was to deliver and we were able

329
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,679
to deliver

330
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,320
the major schemes and they worked

331
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,160
properly out of these

332
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,000
schemes there was a plenty of other

333
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,919
schemes we have had

334
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,919
rent cost scheme

335
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,120
up to 95 million euro and 40 million

336
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
euros second year then we have the

337
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,919
tourism scheme which was totally in in

338
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,840
two years 228 millions and

339
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,440
some other cultural scheme 30 million

340
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,640
euro and so on and so on so on uh

341
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
and at the end

342
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,640
the figures are showing that the

343
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,760
help or the support was very effective

344
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,000
because we have had on a cumulative

345
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
basis

346
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,360
decrease in

347
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
profits not in profits in corporate

348
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,120
taxes just spun by 0.1 comparing 2020 to

349
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,240
2090 which is for me unbelievable it's

350
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
unbelievable it's not distributed

351
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
equally yes we have three sectors where

352
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,200
the damage is the highest and this is

353
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,480
cultural

354
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,600
area this is tourism and this is gastro

355
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,840
it means restaurants and so on where the

356
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,880
losses were up to 40 and above 40

357
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,160
percent uh compared to 2090 but on the

358
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
micro economical picture

359
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,919
we performed

360
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,480
surprisingly uh well with corporate

361
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,520
profit

362
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,480
tax

363
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,520
lower

364
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,799
by just 0.1 this is for me the main

365
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,039
message so the unemployment

366
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,160
developed

367
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,799
above expectation and corporate profits

368
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,559
in the total number

369
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,960
performed above expectation which in

370
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
total help us

371
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,120
to move

372
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,840
in the accommodation in the overall

373
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,240
european european union where we have

374
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
three or four years

375
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
where we are not able to catch up with

376
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the with the average

377
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
gdp growth but now we are above so some

378
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,159
these are the figures which

379
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,440
present that

380
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,000
so far we were able to give the

381
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,679
appropriate response

382
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,559
and

383
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,520
the the speeder uh yeah to be quick in

384
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,000
this response were it was even more uh

385
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
important than to be efficient down to

386
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,280
the last euro okay thank you very much

387
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
and congratulations so not only were

388
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,520
these measures effective but you even

389
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,080
managed to keep the tax revenue losses

390
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
in check and contained so that's

391
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,039
wonderful

392
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,120
okay uh turning to you gordon you have

393
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,600
this interesting um

394
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
mix of experience as a very high level

395
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
statesman but also currently heading the

396
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
infrastructure projects at a leading

397
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,880
private equity firm

398
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,760
so what is your take do you observe

399
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,159
signs of a strong recovery in your line

400
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,520
of business and do we to a large extent

401
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,760
all this to the fiscal stimuli that have

402
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,080
been rolled out all across the board

403
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,159
let me start from the macro side so i

404
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,039
agree with the state secretary that uh

405
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,840
and it's in a broader sense in europe

406
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,400
and in the world governments reacted

407
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,320
well or at least much much better than

408
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,480
to the great financial crisis 10 years

409
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,080
ago 11 years ago

410
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,280
in terms of

411
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
uh fiscal policy reaction also learning

412
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,080
from from the mistakes of 10 years ago

413
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,919
called kurtzer bite is one example of

414
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,720
that

415
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
they reacted very well

416
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,919
also they were

417
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,840
supported by two facts this was not an

418
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,960
economic crisis in its origins this was

419
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
a completely independent thing it was

420
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,760
not a crisis of inductedness or slow

421
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,039
growth or

422
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,039
other problems it was a cri it was an

423
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,039
independent crisis which

424
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,919
heavily impacted the the economy the

425
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,480
reaction the first reaction was

426
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,320
mostly appropriate

427
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,720
depends also how indebted the countries

428
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,559
how much can they afford but overall

429
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,799
everybody took on a lot of that

430
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,480
now

431
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
i think everybody who is a leader in a

432
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,880
national bank or or somewhere has to now

433
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,039
think ahead or in a ministry what's

434
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,600
what's the impact of this incredible

435
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,159
amount of debt that was taken on by

436
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,600
governments

437
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,320
and

438
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,880
and that's a big risk uh in my mind

439
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
because this debt was taken on in a very

440
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,039
low interest rate environment a very low

441
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,679
inflation environment the question is

442
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,720
what happens if that changes

443
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,960
inflation is up now but that was

444
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
expected year on year that's normal

445
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,440
after a fallback the question is is

446
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,080
inflation going to stay and if is

447
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,000
inflation going to stay and some

448
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,120
governments have gone to extremely high

449
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,600
debt levels

450
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,360
than

451
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,919
many of the central banks in the world

452
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,440
it was a very interesting discussion in

453
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
the previous session many of the central

454
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,520
banks in the world

455
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
are too degree trapped

456
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,799
in the sense they should increase

457
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,320
interest rates to stem inflation

458
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
but

459
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,159
they may bankrupt their own governments

460
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,000
who are sometimes hundred and thirty

461
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,400
hundred and fifty sixty percent debt to

462
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,520
gdp

463
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,840
that's a huge dilemma and that's

464
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
that's why inflation is the number one

465
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,520
question when i look at my current

466
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,120
territory

467
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,039
for example infrastructure finance or

468
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,080
more broadly financed

469
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
what happens with interest rates and how

470
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
will it impact

471
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,760
economic

472
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,440
growth so that's

473
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,360
one uh thing the other one is

474
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,200
why don't i stop here you you have to

475
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,720
ask many questions

476
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
okay okay we can stop here and we will

477
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
definitely uh get back to the current

478
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,480
macroeconomic developments deflationary

479
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,159
pressures and many of the things you

480
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,400
have mentioned but before we do i want

481
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,960
to uh give the floor to mr charney and i

482
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,440
want to ask you how did my mastercard

483
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,279
respond to the pandemic and what were

484
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,120
some of the challenge challenges that

485
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
you had to deal with against the

486
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,720
backdrop of this policy discussion also

487
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,640
um that we're having

488
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,400
so i mean as the payment scheme the one

489
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,159
thing that we have seen was that the

490
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,120
digital payments infrastructure as such

491
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
became probably

492
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,000
the most important uh

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,159
element uh or its importance has

494
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,960
increased in in time significantly for

495
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
smooth operations of the economics in

496
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,159
the economy in the country so what we

497
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,000
have what we have

498
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,600
been working on as our number one

499
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,360
priority is of course make sure the

500
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,919
infrastructure is resilient meaning that

501
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,960
the digital payments are still the not

502
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,760
only the most convenient but also the

503
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,120
safest

504
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,480
and uh and the most secure uh means

505
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,000
means of payment

506
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
uh but we were working a lot on

507
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,279
accessibility of that infrastructure

508
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,960
because that was a topic that was very

509
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
much highlighted and by accessibility i

510
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,480
mean accessibility to consumers so in a

511
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,880
lot of european countries we were uh

512
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,360
working on raising uh the limits for

513
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,600
contactless payments so those can be

514
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,480
done

515
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
very seamlessly without interactions

516
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,240
with the payment terminal

517
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,200
we were working on access to the digital

518
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
payments infrastructure by the small and

519
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
medium enterprises

520
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,919
by entrepreneurs because suddenly

521
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,000
acceptance of digital payments became a

522
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,600
hygienic factor it was a a shop or no

523
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,880
shop decision which which many consumers

524
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,360
were doing during the pandemic so we

525
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
wanted to make sure that digital

526
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,279
payments do not stay only the domain of

527
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,760
the large retail but it can be really an

528
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,080
infrastructure and accessible to all so

529
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,240
in many countries we have started

530
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,400
projects focusing on this

531
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,919
but what was what was probably very

532
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,520
interesting is that

533
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,159
uh uh the pandemic uh showed us that uh

534
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,640
there is a lot of potential in uh the

535
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,600
domain of public private partnerships

536
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,159
and that we can actually go beyond the

537
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
payments business as such and we can

538
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,919
start looking at very interesting areas

539
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,440
of cooperation with the governments

540
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,320
such as working with data to make sure

541
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,720
that there is timely information about

542
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,600
how

543
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
the different uh recovery measures uh

544
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
take effect in the economy and how do we

545
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,320
that we measure them right we were

546
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,279
working with insights to support

547
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,840
planning for recovery of highly impacted

548
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,520
tourism sector at

549
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,960
was mentioned

550
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,120
um you are working on topics of cyber

551
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
security where we are basically taking

552
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,440
the global know-how from uh you know

553
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,919
something that is very much on the on

554
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,320
the forefront of attention when it comes

555
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,520
to cyber threats the payments financial

556
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,679
world we're trying to bring the know-how

557
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,919
outside into industries such as

558
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,840
healthcare such as

559
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,640
such as others and finally

560
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,840
also

561
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,520
the pandemic brought

562
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,480
brought

563
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,799
more attention to topics such as

564
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,600
sustainability so we're looking at how

565
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,360
we can support sustainability not only

566
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,640
in terms of

567
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,559
you know looking at our own business

568
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,360
which

569
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,600
quite frankly has relatively limited

570
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,919
environmental impact but mostly how we

571
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,200
can use the network to engage consumers

572
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,679
engage citizens to make more informed

573
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,840
decisions in terms of sustainability and

574
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,000
contribute so that we can change the

575
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,600
landscape from regulation to a positive

576
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
momentum

577
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,760
thank you very much uh for your for your

578
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,880
account and we will get back uh to that

579
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,640
in a little bit but i would like to pick

580
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,559
your brains on something else right now

581
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,080
so

582
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,559
yes we're having the energy crisis but

583
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,320
uh based on many data and incoming

584
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
information all across the board we're

585
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,520
also having a robust recovery in terms

586
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
of the volumes of manufacturing the

587
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,520
volumes of of trade even the the supply

588
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,840
of the sector specific supply shortages

589
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,799
uh are in some respect a testament to

590
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,640
that

591
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,240
and of course we have the rising

592
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,159
inflation that has been mentioned uh

593
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,760
time and time again throughout the

594
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,720
summit

595
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,679
so

596
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,360
this is one thing the macroeconomic

597
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,279
conditions and then

598
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,360
we also have to remember that as the

599
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,880
pandemic landed in the region the the

600
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,679
region was already at a declining path

601
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,840
in terms of productivity and in terms of

602
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
competitiveness so then there is the

603
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,799
consideration

604
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,120
of productivity

605
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,799
keeping indiscriminate fiscal support

606
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,960
for a long time

607
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,279
and and supporting sometimes

608
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,440
unproductive firms and sometimes

609
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,520
unviable business models so

610
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,679
considering the macro conditions and

611
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,840
this productivity argument

612
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,159
what is your take and i would like to

613
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,760
hear very briefly from each of you what

614
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,799
is your take on getting more selective

615
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,880
with this help and perhaps

616
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,360
rolling a little bit some of this help

617
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
back

618
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
maybe starting with state secretary

619
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,279
klimek

620
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,880
yeah

621
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,760
for me

622
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
first we have to understand what's

623
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,960
behind the current development

624
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,399
the inflation

625
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:13,840
and

626
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,440
this acceleration in gdp has two parents

627
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,760
and one trigger the parents are

628
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,159
globalization and optimization and the

629
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,000
trigger was the pandemic

630
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,520
so

631
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,720
we now have the problems in certain

632
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,000
automotive chip industry and so on and

633
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,320
the reasoning behind is that we in the

634
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,880
past streamlined all the processes and

635
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,080
we have only few producers of several

636
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,640
goods and even these deliveries are

637
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,559
optimized in schemes just in time and

638
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,720
without any any

639
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,600
reserves or any buttons

640
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,880
that we

641
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,600
could adopt and this needs time and if

642
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
you do not have yeah to adopt to the to

643
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,279
the reduction it's easy yeah you close

644
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,880
your lines and

645
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,760
uh are closed but to adopt to

646
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,120
immediately

647
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,240
tripling or quadruplin the demand it's

648
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
impossible in situation of optimization

649
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,200
and globalization and therefore this

650
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,000
reaction will take some time but

651
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,159
yesterday i had a meeting with with the

652
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,679
asa

653
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,880
hat this is the european association of

654
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,440
energy regulators and

655
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,600
we went into the detail and the answer

656
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,240
was or the main expectation is that yeah

657
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,039
we will have spike in

658
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,919
electricity prices and energy as well

659
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,640
but

660
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,720
the futures

661
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,679
market futures options and so on

662
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,480
are showing that this should then in

663
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,919
second quarter of the next year uh went

664
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,840
lower and then we could come to a new

665
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,240
normal new normal won't be the la the

666
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,360
old normal because yes we have in place

667
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,080
the all the green policies

668
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,840
now turning into fit for 55 which means

669
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,279
the cost of co2 will be there and the

670
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,840
policies they shall be there

671
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
and increase the

672
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,760
the fossil production costs and so on

673
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,480
but

674
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,880
the inflation shall then

675
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
went down or

676
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,440
should should be reduced and again the

677
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,840
globalization optimization

678
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,960
will bring pressure on this so

679
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,880
from my perspective

680
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,399
this this is the main frame and coming

681
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,720
down to your second question

682
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,080
yeah

683
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,960
the

684
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,440
quick help

685
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,080
made sense in 2020 but we should not

686
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,880
turn into zombification it means we

687
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,840
should not

688
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,760
uh turn into

689
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,399
yeah what we've had in all our countries

690
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,840
it means socialist

691
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,320
systems where everybody is preserved not

692
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,880
to fail because if everybody is prepared

693
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,480
not to fail

694
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,320
the general system fails

695
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,200
so

696
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,159
this

697
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,039
is up to us now to

698
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,720
give the support only where the impacts

699
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,480
are still there but temporary impacts

700
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,760
and not to compensate the structural

701
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,240
changes which definitely are taking

702
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
place and

703
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,919
maybe some of the changes and it's again

704
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,240
i think in chinese is the problem and

705
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,000
opportunity the same

706
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,120
mark

707
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,720
we we

708
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,600
are now taking uh the the changes as the

709
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,880
opportunity maybe some changes with

710
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,200
or maybe i'm sure a lot of these changes

711
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,919
of

712
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,039
of e-commerce would be there

713
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,440
but in five years and the pandemic

714
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,559
brought us

715
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,200
these five years in forward so

716
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,480
i'm quite sure that we should be wise

717
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,200
and spend the public money which are

718
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,519
limited uh in

719
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,720
in a very reasonable way and not to

720
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,919
zombify

721
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,679
the industries and the

722
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,159
economy system which are not from a

723
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,000
long-term perspective sustainable

724
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,840
sustainability is the key

725
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,440
excellent thank you for this frank

726
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,600
account and that seamlessly brings us to

727
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,519
the k-ship recovery but before we dive

728
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,799
into that i want to ask mr chutney

729
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,440
you work in your line of business

730
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,120
you cooperate with a lot of small and

731
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,960
medium-sized enterprises that have been

732
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,080
especially hard hit by this pandemic

733
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,960
so do these concerns that we have talked

734
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,000
about do they justify getting selective

735
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,480
and where would you like to see

736
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,559
the policy help the policy support

737
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,559
sustain what kind of firms business

738
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,799
models projects

739
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,559
look i would say

740
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,799
almost regardless at which data points

741
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,559
you look at it's it's evident that the

742
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:57,760
smes are backbone of the european and

743
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,399
local economy so i think they should

744
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,200
absolutely be supported however

745
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,640
what i believe

746
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,039
we must do is is actually shift the

747
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,280
focus shift the focus from

748
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,800
uh you know the the financial stimuli

749
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,359
that are helping to compensate losses

750
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,480
but gradually look at how we can support

751
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,359
these smes these entrepreneurs in terms

752
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,079
of growing in the future you know in

753
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,359
terms of

754
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,480
embracing digitalization because in many

755
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,440
aspects digitalization is a hot trend

756
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,480
however in many cases reserved to larger

757
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,440
enterprises who have the skills and the

758
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,719
resources to benefit from it

759
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,359
they must be supported to be resilient

760
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,918
again especially in a world where cyber

761
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,000
threats are becoming more and more

762
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,199
prevalent

763
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,480
and in general supported to have the

764
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
access to the right business models

765
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,480
right right now how

766
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,119
i think the good news that i can say as

767
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,000
a representative of the private sector

768
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,320
is that in principle

769
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,400
all of this support does not have to

770
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,720
come out of the public sector out of

771
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,280
public finance because private sector is

772
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,560
very much ready to get engaged here and

773
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,760
uh and uh get involved

774
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,000
actually in mastercard we do have we do

775
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,720
have a philosophy which is uh which is

776
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,720
uh uh basically doing well by doing good

777
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,320
which which enables us to effectively

778
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,520
combine

779
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,400
focus on our business with supporting

780
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,839
the local environment including the smes

781
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,440
but there is still a role that the

782
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,640
public sector has to play here

783
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,040
first and foremost it has to create an

784
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
environment where the public-private

785
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
partnerships can be created effectively

786
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,040
and second of all it has to support the

787
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,119
environment with putting in place the

788
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,760
right framework so that the different

789
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,000
players out of the private sector can

790
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,880
effectively coordinate on the support of

791
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,359
the smes so that the ecosystem doesn't

792
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,920
become a fight for a customer but from

793
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,599
their really effective support of the

794
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,520
local businesses

795
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,040
thank you very much

796
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,640
for this account public private

797
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,359
partnerships also based on our findings

798
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,200
as well as a part of the report will be

799
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,800
absolutely instrumental in getting out

800
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,680
of this crisis and in the recovery now

801
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
finally turning to you gordon and the

802
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,920
k-ship recovery so the situation where

803
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,760
some sectors are winning from this

804
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,440
pandemic from these structural shifts

805
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,920
and others are losing and on a decline

806
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,920
and potentially permanently

807
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,760
who are the winners and the losers of

808
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,839
this pandemic at a global scale and

809
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,720
perhaps in europe and in this region

810
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
what are the trends here and maybe also

811
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,960
what does it imply for the future course

812
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,680
of policy

813
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:49,359
that's a very broad question let me

814
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,720
start

815
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,200
with a global answer i i believe this

816
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,960
crisis the pandemic has not changed the

817
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,960
the long-term trajectories in the world

818
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,160
but just accelerated very much

819
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,400
uh many things and at the micro level

820
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,320
and the macro level and the macro level

821
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,359
a few trends to say so i think we are

822
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,320
seeing a a decline slow down and

823
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,200
probably

824
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,599
reversal of globalization

825
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,240
but it's not going to go back to

826
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,480
national level it's going to go back to

827
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,480
regionalization if you think about

828
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,800
supply chains or the political

829
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,359
bifurcation in technology between china

830
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,920
and and the united states for example

831
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,480
and in this regionalization clearly

832
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,760
china

833
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,680
and its world and the us and this world

834
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,079
are key defining regions the stake for

835
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,839
europe is

836
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,720
to be the third leading region sitting

837
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,320
at the table where the decisions are

838
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,480
made because if you don't sit at the

839
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,119
table you will be on the menu and that's

840
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,760
the choice uh that europe nicely put

841
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,520
uh second key trend i think that because

842
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,160
after a long period of since basically

843
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,160
the collapse of the soviet union there's

844
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,800
a long period when market economy

845
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
was the driving force in the world and

846
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,960
markets were the the primary logic and

847
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,640
politics was

848
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,720
in in secondary to that i think it's

849
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,280
going to change now because of these

850
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,160
strategic conflicts globally

851
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,040
politics very often will overrule the

852
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,400
market logic

853
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,040
and strategy will be more important than

854
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,240
profits

855
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,320
think about supply chains

856
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,520
europe export importing 93 of its

857
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,560
paracetamols from india can you be

858
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,880
dependent on india just for fever pills

859
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,640
it's a very simple or think about the

860
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,160
gas crisis

861
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,320
that is happening today yes it may be

862
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,440
cheaper

863
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,599
in certain periods to buy gas from

864
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,800
russia

865
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,040
but it's only cheap as long as they they

866
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,520
want to keep it cheap and uh you want to

867
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,359
be i don't go more into that but you

868
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,720
understand what i'm

869
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,640
i'm trying to say

870
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,960
absolutely and so now in this in this is

871
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,240
gonna be i think a long-term trend cycle

872
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,480
after after the pandemic and and this

873
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,119
means those who understand the message

874
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,800
of this crisis and can adapt their

875
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,599
behavior to this can be on the upper end

876
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,880
of the k

877
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,440
and those who don't will go down on the

878
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,599
other other end of the k now in terms of

879
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,920
acceleration there were existing mega

880
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,960
trends

881
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,520
a few in the world before

882
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,000
the pandemic crisis

883
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,320
and they just accelerated the one is is

884
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,560
climate change related talking about

885
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
business energy transition that's a mega

886
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,119
trend that's going to accelerate and the

887
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,119
amount of money with the new eu

888
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,839
regulation of the sustainable finance

889
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,040
directive

890
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,520
pushing all the investors and and

891
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,680
all the financial institutions savers

892
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,000
into investing only into climate change

893
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,400
not friendly that would be the wrong way

894
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,839
to put it anti-climate change

895
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,359
uh products

896
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,040
more and more money is going to go that

897
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,920
way

898
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,240
and i think the whole behavior

899
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,599
in the industry is going to change

900
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,760
europe has a great opportunity there and

901
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,440
central europe for think about the

902
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,960
battery alliance in slovakia for example

903
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
has a great chance

904
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,240
if it realizes but what it can do so one

905
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,119
key key trend is energy transition

906
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:19,920
uh

907
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
can central eastern europe adapt to that

908
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,520
or not the second key trend is

909
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,440
digitalization

910
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,520
um in a very broad sense not just

911
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,920
thinking about apps and services but all

912
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,359
our industries the manufacturing

913
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,520
processes that's a big opportunity but a

914
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,240
big threat for us because cheap labor

915
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,800
is not so relevant anymore in the total

916
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,079
product cost

917
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,800
so that's something we need to adapt to

918
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,000
and then just to to put the final

919
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,839
comment here and then let the others

920
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,240
comment on this is

921
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,920
the number one thing that we should

922
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,000
spend all those not all the most of the

923
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,520
recovery money

924
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,920
on and and the proceeds and dividends

925
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,920
from from the growth and return is

926
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,119
education

927
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,200
because what what is changing

928
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
in the world is that you need much

929
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,040
higher educated workforce to be able to

930
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,960
adapt to those changes

931
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,280
in the world and i think where and you

932
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,200
had an interesting figure on that in

933
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,960
your report of where the different

934
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,200
countries in the region stand i think

935
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,359
overall the quality of education in our

936
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:20,880
region

937
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,720
is and i'm talking about very practical

938
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,599
skills and abilities work related

939
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,560
education are behind the average of the

940
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,119
european union not to mention places

941
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,839
like singapore or japan or korea so

942
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,440
there's a lot to catch up on and a lot

943
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,040
of money should money

944
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,280
and more than money thinking and

945
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,040
planning should go into that

946
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,560
thank you very much uh this is a

947
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,200
fascinating discussion and i think you

948
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,119
ending it up on a note that we really

949
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:49,359
need to invest into education and

950
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,520
especially so in this region

951
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,040
is a great place to stop uh do i see any

952
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,200
raised hands

953
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,000
if not alternatively i would perhaps

954
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
like to invite a representative from the

955
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,079
app group if he or he is in the room to

956
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,319
offer a comment a first response or ask

957
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,680
a question

958
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
because we had a deal like that but i

959
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,520
don't see any raised hands

960
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,119
all right

961
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,599
then aside from app group anyone has any

962
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,359
questions or comments

963
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,759
yes please

964
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,200
you know

965
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,280
it was interesting point

966
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,200
made that

967
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,640
the driving force will move from

968
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,880
market to basically

969
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,200
politically driven decision

970
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,000
you know

971
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,280
in slovakia we transition from socialism

972
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,720
to market economy what we observed that

973
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,319
political decisions uh driven primarily

974
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,720
led to basically

975
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,280
economy not progressing well uh compared

976
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,520
to market economies now

977
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,800
that trend going in other countries what

978
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,160
will prevent

979
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,760
similar effect

980
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,720
and

981
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,680
you know

982
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,720
economically stalling behind china if

983
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,480
the politics

984
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,800
will be more dominant than market forces

985
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,119
how we prevent same effect which

986
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,160
socialism suffered

987
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,200
if i can i raise this point uh

988
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,839
just first clear clarify my position i

989
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,520
don't like it

990
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,119
i'm just forecasting that this is going

991
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,800
to happen even if i don't like it and

992
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,400
it's good to

993
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,560
since i'm not in politics i don't need

994
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,480
to talk about what should happen but

995
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,520
what will happen probably and i think

996
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,359
there is a great

997
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,319
tendency when when you have

998
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,279
geopolitics

999
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,520
strengthening that

1000
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,359
governments will say yes it would be

1001
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:57,680
cheaper to buy it would be more easy we

1002
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,079
should deregulate sectors but we won't

1003
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,560
because there are other so that will

1004
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,880
that is not so strange in china but if

1005
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,160
you think about what's happening with

1006
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,920
the chinese technology sector in the

1007
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,119
last few

1008
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,400
months

1009
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,400
you can see how the state is overriding

1010
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,880
the market uh

1011
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,119
reforms they introduced earlier

1012
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:18,880
but it will happen in the us and it is

1013
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,400
happening in the u.s it is happening in

1014
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,200
europe so that is i think these things

1015
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,599
are moving cycle and if if politics and

1016
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,280
government will mess up at the end or

1017
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,280
will become too dominant then economies

1018
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,640
will slow down there will be and then

1019
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,480
there will be a correction

1020
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,440
uh i i i think the art of governance

1021
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,400
would be to keep the two too in balance

1022
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,319
uh but we should i'm just warning all of

1023
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,680
us that we should prepare that the

1024
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,920
natural tendency now is

1025
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,240
that very often the market logic and the

1026
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,359
private uh sector dominance of decision

1027
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,760
making that that was prevalent in the

1028
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,640
world will be overruled very often by

1029
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,599
non-non-market

1030
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,680
strategic considerations rightly or

1031
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,839
wrongly so we are writing in violent

1032
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,119
yes we are

1033
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,040
state secretary did you have a comment

1034
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,760
there is a saying

1035
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,640
there is an old saying stating that

1036
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,240
the

1037
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,599
tough times produce great leaders

1038
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,960
great leaders

1039
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,880
produce

1040
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,040
good times good times

1041
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,520
produce

1042
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,280
weak men

1043
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,319
sorry

1044
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,560
i i was

1045
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,040
weak man and weak leaders produce again

1046
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,280
tough times and this is the circle uh

1047
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,040
for me i'm i'm quite close to

1048
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,079
to the ideas or to thoughts with

1049
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,160
which god mentioned i'm afraid if we in

1050
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,400
the global competition

1051
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,359
china india us

1052
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,280
africa and so on asia

1053
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,680
total

1054
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,880
were

1055
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,560
putting too much

1056
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,960
pressure or too much focus on

1057
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,040
on political issues which are not in

1058
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,560
line with the market we will lose but i

1059
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,599
hope

1060
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:10,640
and

1061
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,200
this is my second thought

1062
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,480
and the history taught me that

1063
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,640
the

1064
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:22,160
people are or the countries and also

1065
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,599
european union is able to adopt

1066
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:27,440
and

1067
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,880
i hope that

1068
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,880
if there is a

1069
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,200
showing that that we are slowing down

1070
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,520
and we are losing our market share and

1071
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,920
the european union is not performing

1072
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,280
properly that the counter pressure will

1073
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,200
come and again

1074
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,560
the the leaders

1075
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,079
would be forced to react to that so

1076
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,440
which exactly is the case and

1077
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,319
more or less this is the same idea which

1078
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,300
uh

1079
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,560
[Music]

1080
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,000
which is a

1081
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,200
jewish

1082
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,240
writer

1083
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,960
is putting in this ramadaos book that

1084
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,760
that

1085
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,839
look at this pandemic and look at the

1086
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,839
pandemic 100 years ago isn't it

1087
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,760
excellent from this perspective how the

1088
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,680
how the civilization was able to manage

1089
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,720
all this crisis i mean uh yeah the

1090
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,960
people were dying but but the ratio

1091
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,359
between the people dying today and 100

1092
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,119
years ago is one two thousand so uh so i

1093
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,680
believe and i try to be optimistic that

1094
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,040
despite the fact that we have temporary

1095
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,160
cycles where politics are producing

1096
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,040
uh

1097
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,000
market losses that this will then at the

1098
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
end will again in the cycle be

1099
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,280
compensated and the pressure from the

1100
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,119
people or from the

1101
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:46,960
from all the countries will come back

1102
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,800
and accommodate

1103
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,040
the policies which more or less was the

1104
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,599
idea i think mr prime minister mentioned

1105
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,160
also in his first panel that

1106
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,000
yeah it's

1107
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,760
questionable

1108
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,559
whether the leadership of the europe in

1109
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,319
the green agenda

1110
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:07,680
is reasonable if the other regions will

1111
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,599
not follow

1112
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,240
but if this will be the case also in in

1113
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,960
several years from now then we have to

1114
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,640
adopt the policy because yeah europe

1115
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,720
alone could not

1116
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,920
save the whole planet we all have to

1117
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,800
work together so i try to be optimistic

1118
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,000
and i hope

1119
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,040
the civilization showed in the past that

1120
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,200
the accommodation is going on now that's

1121
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,640
a really interesting

1122
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,800
point and i think this is also a great

1123
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,359
point to stop so i would like to thank

1124
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,680
you to the distinguished panel for their

1125

1126
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,599
enticing discussion

1127
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,960
and uh coming right up at this stage uh
