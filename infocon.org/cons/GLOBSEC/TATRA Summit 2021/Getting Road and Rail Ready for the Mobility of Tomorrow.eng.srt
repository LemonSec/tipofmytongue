1
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,879
it's a fast mode but

2
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,640
i think it's typical for tata summit

3
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
that we and globsec that we live in very

4
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
charged and uh intensive time but i

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,120
think uh we show also results as well so

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,760
um welcome to this panel uh the panel is

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,719
called getting road and rail ready for

8
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,399
mobility of tomorrow

9
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,280
i have three wonderful panelists with me

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,519
and i think it's a great mixture of

11
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,320
somebody from the industry itself

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,080
somebody from the actually official

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,520
minister from the national level but

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,840

thank you

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,040
next time we hope you will drive here to

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,520
the to the floor on a little little

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,560
electric bmw do you have electric bikes

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,040
uh bicycles letters and maybe i can do

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,960
that with that i'm not going to mobile

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,720
though excellent excellent let's be

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,320
let's be careful about promises you

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,200
remember last time i promised the trend

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,960
and it did happen yes and i think we

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,880
should i suggest that we actually

38
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
applaud to the minister who really

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,840
delivered on his promise from last year

40
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,000
thank you so much and i think this shows

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,038
that uh

42
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,640
politicians don't have to be just about

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,840
talking about but actually about

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
delivering in in reality it's uh it's

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,560
very nice to nice to see that so we have

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,959
two types of topics we have about

47
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
road transport and then we have about

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,480
railways

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
we would like to i would like to kind of

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,640
subdivide our discussion into these two

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,319
two areas although they are obviously

52
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,200
part of

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,120
uh transfer infrastructure in general

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,519
but still having specific issues for

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,000
each of them so let's start with the

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,200
road transport and road mobility uh

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
obviously undergoing huge profound

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
changes with the new targets

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,840
of moving towards feed

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,920
455 all the new regulations on the eu

61
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
level where

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,360
producers of cars and governments have

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,840
to have to apply to and

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,920
be in line

65
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
actually cars and trucks are responsible

66
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,120
for approximately 21 of the eu co2

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
output so there is a lot to be done on

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,519
that side and the move towards electric

69
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,680
mobility um

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
is and hybrid is very important we had

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
actually interesting discussion in the

72
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,560
morning in our focus group on this issue

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,280
which actually showed that there is a

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,920
danger or a challenge of potentially

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,239
developing a two-speed europe

76
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,319
europe which will be divided between

77
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,200
east and west and about north and south

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,280
basically the division

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,239
which shows that those people who are uh

80
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,159
who have better purchasing power in the

81
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,640
north or in the west and can afford more

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,200
pricier electric vehicles can do it

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,720
faster and quicker

84
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,159
and they can also develop the charging

85
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,720
infrastructure much faster and then

86
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,799
we the central eastern europeans who

87
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,239
cannot afford it do not have the

88
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,720
subsidies from the government and uh

89
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,439
basically are then kind of reduced to uh

90
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,879
buying uh

91
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,920
used cars from the west and kind of

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,000
continue with the combustion engine

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
so i would actually start the discussion

94
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
and we don't have unfortunately too much

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
time so i would like to ask each speaker

96
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,360
panelist to keep the initial remarks to

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,200
about five minutes and then i will ask

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,519
for any questions but i would like to go

99
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,560
actually to uh to andreas somebody from

100
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,160
the industry obviously bmw is a leading

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,400
european manufacturer it's also good to

102
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
see that you have very ambitious goals

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,880
for introducing electro mobility and

104
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,520
production of uh eevee cars in in your

105
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
own schedule

106
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,880
how do you see the situation in europe

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,479
and where do you see our the main

108
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,160
challenges and especially also where the

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
governments and in particular in central

110
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,400
eastern europe can be helpful

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,199
yeah thank you so much um

112
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,000
for

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
inviting me here and and also for the

114
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
very interesting focus group we had

115
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,960
early on today that was very

116
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,919
um

117
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,800
very

118
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,790
good

119
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,880
[Music]

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,199
so let me let me talk a little bit about

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,520
where we are with electric mobility and

122
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,639
um

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
electric mobility is a topic that is now

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,479
with bmw since 2008 we are working on

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,919
that 2013 saw the bmw i3

126
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,759
and since then we have enhanced our

127
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,360
product portfolio with both plug-in

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,280
hybrids and

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,600
with full battery electric vehicles we

130
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
have one here on display if you like

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
you're more than invited to see the

132
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
brand new ix

133
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,880
the challenges of electric mobility have

134
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,400
always been

135
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,280
rip rest in peace if you like but it

136
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
really stands for range infrastructure

137
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,280
and price

138
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,680
and when you look into the product of

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,400
today

140
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,000
um the ix but also competitors vehicles

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,320
they are basically solving that issues

142
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,000
you know we are talking a range

143
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,720
500 600 kilometers which is for an

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
electric vehicle obviously and for any

145
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
mobility need really

146
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,120
no longer something that is limiting

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
yourself

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,280
the infrastructure is a hot topic and

149
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,240
one that really needs uh uh

150
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
really needs

151
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
attention

152
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
yeah and i'll come to that uh in in a

153
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,800
minute and then the price topic and yes

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,360
we see decreasing uh prices for electric

155
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
vehicles

156
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,960
and some of what we namely with

157
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
batteries becoming cheaper uh what we

158
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,680
get there we invest then in longer

159
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
ranges in the vehicle but you see that

160
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,960
there is also a

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
light at the end of the tunnel when it

162
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,479
comes to pricing for the time being the

163
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,400
success of the electric vehicle depends

164
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,880
to some degree still on incentives

165
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,160
but

166
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,639
the price is no longer let's put it that

167
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,759
way a big issue at least for new new car

168
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,600
buyers we are not talking here used car

169
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
buyers which obviously is also a big

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,440
topic we we discussed that in the focus

171
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,000
group but for new car buyers um it

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
becomes apparent that even the new price

173
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
of the vehicle is is getting into a

174
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,080
world where they can say okay i can

175
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
afford for example a full electric mini

176
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,960
i can afford a bmw i3 academy effort on

177
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,840
i4 and so on

178
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,680
for the topic of infrastructure we are

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
at a decisive point

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,080
currently in the european discussion

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,639
the fit45

182
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,280
proposal of the european commission has

183
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,840
been published 14th of july

184
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
and in there is the so-called aaf here

185
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,759
which is the alternative fuel

186
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,560
infrastructure regulation and that r for

187
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,120
regulation is a very important piece

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,680
because in the olden days it was only a

189
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
directive

190
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,720
and the member states to a large degree

191
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
decided to ignore their

192
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
obligations to install

193
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
infrastructure namely for electric

194
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,280
vehicles

195
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,919
but also for hydrogen

196
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,039
so the

197
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,720
eu commission has decided to turn it

198
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,240
into regulation and we are hopeful and

199
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,360
actually we

200
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,680
would really very much

201
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
push for the fact that it remains a

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,479
regulation also in the political process

203
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,680
we already see that member states are

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,319
in a mode to to dilute the targets in

205
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,560
the affair as it is called

206
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,280
and we feel that this will not

207
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,919
support than the other side of the metal

208
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,720
which is the most stringent co2 targets

209
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,840
for

210
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,680
the car fleet

211
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,199
the truth is even a target of 55

212
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
co2 reduction

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,680
compared to the 2021 level that is

214
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
foreseen till 2030 will only work if

215
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,000
there is a fuel infrastructure

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,159
it's rather banal but it's obviously

217
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
true

218
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
someone who has no idea where he should

219
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
charge his electric vehicle or her

220
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,279
electric vehicle for that matter will

221
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,560
not buy one

222
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
yeah

223
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,959
so um we always think of these two sides

224
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,519
of the coin as being complementary

225
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
and we really need to make sure

226
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,760
that we have sufficient infrastructure

227
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,320
and affair for the time being is good

228
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
because it's regulation but it's even in

229
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,560
its current status not ambitious enough

230
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,640
we want more we need more in order to

231
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,680
make sure

232
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,920
that the european car industry can be

233
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,160
competitive also in the future

234
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
by bringing electric vehicles on the

235
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,880
road and for the european commission to

236
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,480
reach their targets

237
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,240
the last point that i want to make and

238
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,680
you mentioned that there is a divide

239
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,839
between north and and west excuse me

240
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,920
north and south europe and also east and

241
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
west europe the world of an electric

242
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,600
mobility uh

243
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
customer and ev driver in in the

244
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,959
netherlands

245
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,800
is a little bit different from

246
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
the world of an electric vehicle driver

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,200
in may i say that slovakia or a poland

248
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,080
or

249
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
romania yeah

250
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,959
and we see there the risk of a europe of

251
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
two speeds in one of the decisive points

252
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,680
of europe political interest and that's

253
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,760
the question of mobility

254
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
if you end up through the regulatory

255
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
process that you

256
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,399
hamper and and endanger the mobility of

257
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,040
your citizens you will have a problem

258
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,720
and obviously there's also financial

259
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
part to that that you can probably

260
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,959
explore a little bit later but i leave

261
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,320
it at that

262
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
having eaten up my five minutes i guess

263
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,279
already

264
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,000
thank you thank you very much andreas

265
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
again it's great to have the commitment

266
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,959
from the oems to move towards

267
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,760
the electric or hybrid the new mobility

268
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
obviously this has to be matched or has

269
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
to go in parallel with development of

270
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,519
the infrastructure especially charging

271
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,600
infrastructure which is needed

272
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
according to some calculations we need 1

273
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
million charging points in 2025 in the

274
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,240
eu

275
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,320
and currently we have around 20 30 000

276
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
so uh if you want to reach this target

277
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,079
by 2025 it means that each week europe

278
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,880
has to build at least 3 000 charging

279
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,519
points which is quite a quite a target

280
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,200
and quite a challenge but i would like

281
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,399
to move to

282
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,120
to the to minister and

283
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
of course many of these issues are

284
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,079
handled by your colleague minister of

285
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,680
economy in terms of extra mobility and

286
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
developing also the infrastructure

287
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,720
itself but still slovakia is obviously

288
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,200
one of the european hubs or of car

289
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
production

290
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,680
and

291
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,399
it's uh i basically have two kind of

292
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,959
questions one more on a strategic level

293
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,160
how do you

294
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,720
uh how do you see what slovakia or

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,720
government has to do uh to make sure

296
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,959
that slovakia is part of this big change

297
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,680
and shift in the in the mobility uh

298
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,519
overall so that we do not become a kind

299
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,920
of detroit of europe and and and the

300
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
second is uh yes we are talking about

301
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
the new uh a new type of mobility but uh

302
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,519
roads and highways are still important i

303
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,839
mean the classic roads and highways so

304
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,680
if people cannot

305
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,800
do not have

306
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,160
good

307
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,200
and quality roads in this classic way

308
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,920
then

309
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
any charging stations and other things

310
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,800
are

311
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,480
not able to develop either so how do you

312
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,760
see that because

313
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
in a way now this is a kind of bad

314
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,079
transport i would say and we had some

315
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,440
discussions about

316
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,639
labeling

317
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,320
uh because of

318
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
esg and other issues labeling some of

319
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,720
the industries and sectors so how do you

320
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,600
also

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
struggle with this issue of uh roads

322
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,639
being in a kind of uh infanterible of uh

323
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,959
european politics and finance

324
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,720
yeah please

325
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,320
i'm sorry

326
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,920
it's really difficult for me to talk

327
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,040
about uh mobility of of tomorrow about

328
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,200
charging stations about infrastructure

329
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,000
about electric mobility

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,959
but

331
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,600
the problem is at least in slovakia is

332
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
somewhere else

333
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,360
more than 50 percent of our road

334
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,320
infrastructure is in terrible conditions

335
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,639
we still don't have the highway ready

336
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,360
between our uh two big cities

337
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,320
isn't it funny to talk about uh charging

338
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,240
station and modern infrastructure and

339
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,160
smart mobility but we don't have the

340
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,880
basic infrastructure ready yet

341
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,760
so i'm sorry my goal as a minister of

342
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
trust minister of transportation of

343
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,040
transport

344
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,720
uh we need to focus now i'm talking

345
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,839
about road infrastructure

346
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,160
to finish what is under construction

347
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,720
that's the d1d1 highway between east and

348
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,600
west

349
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
we have to

350
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,360
really speed up the process of preparing

351
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,320
the highway r4 it's so-called via

352
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,120
carpathia connecting

353
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,200
the north sea with actually agency

354
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,560
on the south

355
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,279
so this is my these are my targets and

356
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,560
of course i'm i'm some supportive uh

357
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,320
i do support

358
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,959
the minister of economy mr sulik with

359
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,560
all his ideas

360
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
of hydrogen mobility i was supporting

361
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,519
him with his idea to present our

362
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,399
hydrogen car in dubai

363
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,480
but again let's

364
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,399
not die in beauty i mean

365
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,000
we need to say it honestly that we don't

366
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,800
have the basic infrastructure

367
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,240
how do you

368
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,600
where do you see the main sources of

369
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,199
financing for this classic

370
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,600
infrastructure

371
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
thanks to european commission we can at

372
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,880
least talk about development

373
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,440
because from the state budget point of

374
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,079
view we are just co-financing european

375
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,279
projects

376
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,880
no matter if it's railway or road

377
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,320
infrastructure no matter if it's

378
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
classical eu funds or

379
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,600
recovery and resilience fund or chef

380
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,920
projects

381
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,760
many times the state budget is

382
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,560
is at the minimum level to be able to

383
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
co-finance

384
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,600
the eu projects

385
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,199
i i don't have the answer what would

386
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,760
from which sources would we invest

387
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,920
without without eu funds

388
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
of course there might be

389
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,160
uh

390
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,959
ppp projects together with

391
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,800
with private investors

392
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,240
this might be an answer how to how to

393
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,279
speed up the process and how to get rid

394
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,480
of the huge investment depth we have our

395
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,040
depths we have in road infrastructure in

396
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,600
slovakia thank you thank you raj i think

397
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,040
this leads us to

398
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,399
liliana

399
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,480
pavlova because we got into financing

400
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,720
and i know it's not an

401
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,760
easy role probably for you because uh

402
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,320
even when i was still at the we decided

403
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,519
to move and transform eib into a climate

404
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,320
bank which means also getting out of

405
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
supporting any type of

406
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,199
fossil

407
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,680
infrastructure and

408
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,120
industries

409
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,600
so how do you see that and what the ib

410
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
can actually do and so

411
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,320
how could cohesion countries which do

412
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,399
require as you know development of this

413
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,720
sort of classic or basic infrastructure

414
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,240
how they can actually rely or not on eib

415
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,839
thank you very much fazio good morning

416
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,399
everyone uh well indeed it's uh it's

417
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,639
it's a very important topic since yes we

418
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,480
are discussing eab as eu bank bank which

419
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
was established 16 years

420
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,680
ago

421
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,519
uh with the aim to support the

422
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,920
convergence and cohesion and this is

423
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,560
still valid i should say because uh what

424
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,639
we do in support of

425
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,639
of cohesion countries of less developed

426
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,560
regions is

427
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
is still of crucial importance as

428
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,040
minister mentioned because we do have

429
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,920
this kind of still underdeveloped uh

430
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,360
road and rail and energy infrastructure

431
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,399
which we definitely have to continue if

432
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,079
we want to uh as you said to avoid any

433
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,880
any any any thoughts of having two

434
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,480
speeds europe or

435
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,000
uh uh uh

436
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,480
at any dimension but at the same time we

437
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,639
converted uh

438
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,399
in 2019 already into the eu climate bank

439
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,720
and as of last year and

440
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,440
we have uh really

441
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
make we have we have turned the bank

442
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,040
into into a real climate bank with with

443
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,079
three main uh objectives uh supporting

444
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,079
uh green and digital uh

445
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,919
green and digital transformation but the

446
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,199
overall the

447
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,760
the really ambitious targets of the eu

448
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,640
by twenty thirty twenty twenty fifty

449
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,280
first phasing out any projects related

450
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,919
to unabated fossil fuel but at the same

451
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,799
time investing much more in climate and

452
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,079
environment sustainability uh projects

453
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,320
which should be 50 percent of what we do

454
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,000
and what we finance uh and and for me

455
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
here is the very important moment

456
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,799
cohesion and and climate ambition of the

457
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,520
bank and of eu should go hand in hand

458
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
they should not compete they should go

459
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
ahead and they should reinforce each

460
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,000
other if we want to be successful in

461
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,640
deployment of of the new technologies

462
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,440
because the transport is uh

463
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,200
is witnessing

464
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,320
a revolution we may say we are strongly

465
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
committed to deliver and to support the

466
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,799
modernization

467
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,360
electrification

468
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,720
um introduction of for really efficiency

469
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,880
efficiency improvement in the system

470
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,760
with the automate automated transport to

471
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,880
digitalize to provide an 5g networks to

472
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
to enroll but most importantly uh to use

473
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
alternative

474
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,880
fuels but there are two elements which

475
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,679
should go hand-held we should continue

476
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,679
providing necessary funding to develop

477
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,000
roads and rail infrastructure and at the

478
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,720
same time in order not to to be to be

479
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,440
lagers in the group overall we have to

480
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,280
make sure that we

481
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,039
uh invest uh

482
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,520
heavily because the funding gap is is

483
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,360
there in european

484
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,799
in european

485
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,640
supporting battery european battery

486
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
alliance slovak battery initiative like

487
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,280
inubat and any others

488
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,080
providing and establishing a reliable

489
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
sustainable and predictable

490
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
uh network of charging stations because

491
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,080
as you mentioned ambitions of the

492
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,679
ambition of one million charging

493
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
stations is there we at the bank have

494
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,720
special facility targeted to finance

495
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
deployment of discharging stations but

496
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,880
so far we have financed 40 000 so

497
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,840
reaching the the 1 million target is is

498
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,799
a challenge and unless we are doing this

499
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,960
in a very coordinated way

500
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,480
with the regional approach something

501
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,600
which was also emphasized yesterday and

502
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,919
it's it it will be impossible to to

503
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,200
achieve

504
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,160
because

505
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,640
moving and really providing necessary

506
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,559
incentives also for

507
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,120
for for citizens and for the businesses

508
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,480
to switch to electric cars uh they

509
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
should be they should there should be a

510
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,039
reliable and predictable way for them to

511
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,720
plan their trip to plan uh to to have

512
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,960
real-time data to have real-time

513
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,799
applications to to be able to plan the

514
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,840
trip itself not only uh as timic as

515
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,240
conjunctions but as well uh what are the

516
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
the available charging stations on on

517
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,400
the road so these are these are really

518
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,799
the important important uh elements

519
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,120
which i wanted to to emphasize along

520
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,480
with

521
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
with the challenges we face and speaking

522
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,679
on batteries

523
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,039
we need i have very interesting

524
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,840
statistics which which i have because of

525
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
the projection is that the world battery

526
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,720
market will grow to 250 billion per year

527
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
by 2025.

528
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
and for europe

529
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,280
it's it's it's of critical importance

530
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,799
really to to build european automotive

531
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
uh independent uh

532
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
sector and

533
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,960
first to safeguard roads but to to make

534
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,120
sure that that we have and build the

535
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,200
necessary capacity here

536
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,880
we are going into the right direction

537
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,520
because the bank has already financed

538
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,760
projects in the sector for what with

539
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,919
more than one billion we have excellent

540
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,919
examples with uh

541
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,360
not revolt projects starting with 240

542
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,760
million for lithium-ion batteries and

543
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,159
now with the second phase

544
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,320
with with the demonstration planet

545
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
gigafactory and another example in

546
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,520
poland with cathode materials

547
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,720
production facility and swedish kneeler

548
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,200
uh company where we are also supporting

549
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,720
r d in the the new manufacturing clients

550
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
so and 800 million we have already

551
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,000
provided to fiat chrysler to support r d

552
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,640
activities and manufacturing of plug-in

553
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,960
hybrid electric vehicles so funding is

554
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,440
available we do have different uh

555
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,280
facilities funding instruments in the

556
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,520
back we are also adapting the way we are

557
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,720
financing

558
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,960
uh this kind of investment we are in a

559
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,000
process also of uh updating our

560
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,679
transport lending policy to to be able

561
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
really to to to take into consideration

562
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,880
climate ambitions and climate bank

563
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
roadmap on one side and of course the

564
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,799
european strategy for sustainable

565
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,960
mobility uh because

566
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,559
we need to to adopt the financial

567
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,720
instruments fit the purpose

568
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,120
uh and and last but not least uh

569
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,919
facilities to to to

570
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,480
to support the to contribute to the

571
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,799
decarbonization of the transport sector

572
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,039
are of critical importance because

573
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,640
transport is still

574
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,320
uh uh

575
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
providing for 90 percent of the co2

576
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,600
emissions in europe so this is really

577
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,720
the sector of highest priority if we

578
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,400
want to achieve this ambitious goals and

579
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,559
targets thank you very much lyanna

580
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
actually if there are any questions

581
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
please just raise your hands as we are

582
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,640
going through the panel um we have first

583
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,600
one but

584
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,679
before that i will ask that uh if you

585
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,200
could move the microphone here to the

586
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
front row

587
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,640
before we get to the question uh

588
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
building on this issue of

589
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,919
batteries because i think this is very

590
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,760
important issue for for europe european

591
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,159
economy and being competitive also in

592
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,919
the better area which is big part of the

593
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,159
future of the mobility and uh

594
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,520
transformation

595
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,919
um and there is selena lyanna mentioned

596
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,039
there is a kind of strategy on the

597
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,120
european level to support european

598
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
battery

599
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
battery developers and producers in the

600
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,720
future like norswalt hopefully in

601
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,760
slovakia in about and others

602
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,840
but i wonder to what degree and this

603
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
question to andreas to a degree in your

604
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,000
decision making when you are thinking

605
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,880
about uh supplies of batteries to what

606
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,400
degree this issue of european ip and

607
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,600
europeanism in terms of battery sector

608
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,039
does it play any role in your decision

609
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,240
making

610
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,400
where you source better reasons well you

611
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,559
know i um

612
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,880
i'll try to be brief here

613
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,559
when we started with our electric

614
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,960
vehicle initiatives um

615
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,000
we did for example um a first fleet in

616
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
2010

617
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,720
with 1 200 1300 cars to test you know

618
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,320
the markets the customer behavior and so

619
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
on and at the time the battery cells

620
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,480
came from

621
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
a joint venture between bosch

622
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,039
classical german supplier and samsung

623
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,640
that company doesn't exist anymore

624
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,440
then

625
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,440
we we were really thinking you know what

626
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,520
is the battery cell for us

627
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,120
i'm not talking the module here i'm not

628
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
talking the intelligence here but the

629
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
cell itself and it is ultimately a

630
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,120
commodity for us

631
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,279
so in our strategic approach and others

632
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,080
may do other things but in our strategic

633
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,039
approach

634
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,200
we are buying this commodity

635
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
from a supplier

636
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,279
does that mean that we are not

637
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,640
interested in the battery cell it

638
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,120
doesn't we have a 400 million euro

639
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,279
battery research center right at our

640
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,360
engineering

641
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,919
center in in munich where we really

642
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,480
develop the chemistry

643
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,640
the capabilities of the battery and work

644
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
with our suppliers to actually get the

645
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,480
best possible product

646
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,200
and yes we support companies like catl

647
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,840
which are you know building a big

648
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,960
battery

649
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
facility in in the middle of germany

650
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,000
where we have multi-billion euro

651
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,640
contracts with them buying the products

652
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,240
but we are not building our battery

653
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
cells on our own we consider them to be

654
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,120
commodity but we where we are keenly

655
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,039
interested and very much influence what

656
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:09,760
the

657
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,799
actual commodity can do in our product

658
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,880
then we built the modules in our house

659
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
we built the electric engines by the way

660
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,279
without rare earth which is one of the

661
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,320
important things in our house and we

662
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,799
built in-house also the intelligence

663
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,760
that is

664
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,919
you know the whole i.t backbone for for

665
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,240
the um logic of what the battery then

666
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,320
does in the car

667
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,159
thank you thank you actually actually my

668
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,120
point was exactly not to support catl

669
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,360
of these worlds but uh some european

670
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,320
well you know

671
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
you can we are living in a globalized

672
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,840
world and we have obviously also doing

673
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,200
corona times we had this whole

674
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
discussion around resilience and uh you

675
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,279
know when turns resilience into

676
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,840
protectionism and what do we do what do

677
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,240
we need to do in europe and what can we

678
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,400
source elsewhere and you know

679
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,559
catl is a company that builds battery

680
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,039
cells in europe you have the production

681
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:01,919
here

682
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,320
and we are producing bmw cars in china

683
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,559
and you know this is a globalized world

684
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,960
and it's hard to say where where you

685
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,000
know resilience or let's say um

686
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,559
yeah uh uh sovereignty ends and where

687
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
protectionism starts so there's always a

688
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,960
fine line one thing is uh by the way

689
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,480
very important what we are keenly

690
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
interested in is bringing down the co2

691
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,279
emissions and battery productions down

692
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,279
because that is one of the very

693
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,360
influential factors for the carbon

694
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,960
footprint of an electric vehicle

695
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
everybody thinks tailpipe emissions

696
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,880
where the electric vehicle has no issue

697
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,039
because it hasn't got any tailpipe

698
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,080
but you know the the um the uh value

699
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
chain before that is actually carbon uh

700
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,320
in terms of carbon intensity is higher

701
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,919
than for an internal combustion engine

702
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,440
car and that is something that we are

703
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
tackling with our research and also with

704
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,279
our supplies by the way also with north

705
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,840
world with whom we are engaged as well

706
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,880
thank you

707
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,799
very much

708
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,480
just to remind but one was more already

709
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
meant in production of battery co2

710
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,559
emission reduction is critical and

711
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,240
second element we should not only think

712
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,919
about production but later storage and

713
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,720
recycling because silk circular economy

714
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,520
is what we should be targeting otherwise

715
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,840
we might face and we might end up in a

716
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,240
situation where we are having

717
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,120
a

718
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,039
clean uh vehicles and green uh green uh

719
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,039
production of batteries but then with uh

720
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,960
without the necessary facilities for

721
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,600
recycling we will end up with polluting

722
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
even more exactly

723
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,158
please the question

724
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,720
it must be but we need to be

725
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,279
more we want we need to

726
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,320
want more okay so and finally great

727
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,360
because

728
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,919
there is a leader in gaia x in a

729
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,440
catholics project automobile via

730
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,559
country we have a lot of tier 1 tier 2

731
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,880
furniture and we are also involved a

732
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,120
little bit with francesco and dominique

733
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,679
and sebastian and

734
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,760
we need in this

735
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,720
time digital transition green transition

736
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,000
circular economy also to be on this on

737
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,480
this uh on this way this is a

738
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,120
to the future and financing is here

739
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,080
thank you

740
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,179
[Music]

741
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,720
to come back to my previous speech to

742
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
add a little correction

743
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,799
it doesn't mean that we are not

744
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,120
ambitious it doesn't mean that we are

745
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,799
not working uh

746
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,600
on uh on these projects i'm aware of the

747
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,360
fit455

748
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,960
uh initiative whatever i i i'm aware of

749
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,600
uh decreasing the co2 emissions

750
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,360
actually maybe you don't know i'm the

751
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,840
ambassador of the the first zero

752
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:02,000
emission region uh in slovakia and yemen

753
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,919
a few weeks ago there was a conference

754
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,760
here in tatras we were discussing very

755
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,200
heavily about it

756
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
so

757
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,240
sorry for that for the the previous

758
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,640
speech was was more

759
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,440
you know critical to describe

760
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,919
the problems here in slovakia but it

761
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,039
doesn't mean that we are not working

762
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,880
on the how to say a smarter and greener

763
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
economy like you described

764
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,679
thank you any other please please

765
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,919
question here

766
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,000
thank you thank you very much my name is

767
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,039
from

768
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,039
slovakian parliament from

769
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,039
committee of european affairs

770
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,000
my easy question is the search for for

771
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,880
the cars e-cars is electricity you know

772
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,760
now the pricing going high and

773
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,840
what will happen in the future

774
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,120
let's say i am

775
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,240
i'm not in this team expert but i read

776
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,720
somewhere if slovakia have a

777
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,039
maybe only third 20 or 30 of the

778
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,919
electricity car not hybrid electricity

779
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,600
there will be blackout in the country

780
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,919
maybe many other countries will happen

781
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,279
as the same

782
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,279
is somebody thinking about this and how

783
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,640
is the situation now thank you

784
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,919
good question who can who can answer

785
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,480
the master of the class

786
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,320
but maybe from the industry perspective

787
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,080
do you see this uh increases in the

788
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,120
electricity prices as a threat to the

789
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,279
eevee and to the transformation of the

790
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,440
car industry well you know the uh i was

791
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,840
mentioning

792
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,279
my introductory

793
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,919
intervention quickly these rip you know

794
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,720
and price is obviously part of that rip

795
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,080
and that also goes to the cost of

796
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,000
ownership the classical question namely

797
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
for those people who have large fleets

798
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,159
and and by a big amount of cars and

799
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,600
already today

800
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,679
that is relatively clear um the electric

801
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,600
vehicle is superior to the internal

802
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,120
combustion engine vehicle when it comes

803
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,279
to the actual cost of ownership once you

804
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,399
have done the

805
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,399
the the buying decision and bought the

806
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,279
car

807
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,440
um i'm with you that

808
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,880
you know while we are talking about the

809
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
electric vehicle about the charging

810
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,480
infrastructure we need

811
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,039
we need to think about

812
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,559
the question of the integrity of the

813
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,679
grid

814
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
and also about renewable energy

815
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,760
generation

816
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,600
is it a ko criteria in the sense of um

817
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,120
you know we are running here into a risk

818
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,880
that we are not able to solve

819
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,200
my clear answer is no it is not a ko

820
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,760
criteria we can deal with that

821
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,360
we have to deal with that on the other

822
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,640
hand you know

823
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,279
this will not kill the electric car to

824
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,960
quote a famous film

825
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,600
but it is something that we we need to

826
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,880
really handle

827
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,600
and where also the european union

828
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,120
together with the member states have a

829
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,919
large large responsibility to really

830
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,200
make sure

831
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,919
that we are not moving the co2 emissions

832
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,200
only uh

833
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,799
into the value chain that is into the

834
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,120
generation of electricity

835
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
and um but on the other hand and that is

836
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
something that i'm very clear on

837
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,720
you know this is

838
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
we need to take care of it we can take

839
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,799
care of it we will take care of it and

840
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,320
this is really

841
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,559
necessary to gain the co2 emission

842
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,440
advantages of electric mobility but you

843
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,519
know it's it's something that is so

844
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,200
obvious that uh

845
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,960
it needs to be tackled and it will cost

846
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
money no question

847
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,519
and the ultimate uh question remains how

848
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,679
fast we can be with that

849
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,840
so that is really the important question

850
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,279
is not that we have to do the

851
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,000
transformation but how far we can be

852
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,679
thinking not only about car industries

853
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,000
but also the energy supply chain and the

854
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,159
generation of renewable energy but we

855
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,240
can do it that's the quick answer to to

856
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,600
your question maybe just just one

857
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,000
comment on this uh as just uh as

858
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,840
additional discussion last night we were

859
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,519
also having a discussion on energy

860
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,559
transition

861
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,360
the key for successful energy transition

862
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,799
is indeed the electricity grid i mean uh

863
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,799
whenever we have certainly have to

864
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,640
invest in uh

865
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,039
in transition in

866
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:04,159
production and

867
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,799
transition however unless we have

868
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,840
a good

869
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
electricity grid

870
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,799
able

871
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,600
to

872
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,600
uh to adopt the different technologies

873
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,960
renewable energy uh sources we we won't

874
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,760
be able to uh to successfully to

875
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,519
successfully complete this important

876
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,880
element with a

877
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,399
energy transition because

878
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,480
without uh

879
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,159
reliable electricity grid it's it's

880
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,519
mission impossible and it's very

881
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,760
important also element for for for the

882
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,240
modernization of the

883
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
transformation of the transport sector

884
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,880
it also seems to me that we really need

885
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,640
to discuss how we make this

886
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,559
transformation process from

887
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,640
combustion engine into

888
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,320
electric mobility and a new type of

889
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,399
mobility more affordable for large

890
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,559
populations and also for the for the

891
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,720
energy systems as we have uh what i mean

892
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
is that it seems to me that there is now

893
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,600
this competition which uh oem comes with

894
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,120
the car which goes 400 500 600

895
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,080
kilometers on the battery but if you

896
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,159
look at reality of the life

897
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,079
most of our driving is in urban and

898
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,960
suburban areas it's up to 100

899
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
kilometers which would then also

900
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
translate into lower cost of car i

901
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,760
believe

902
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,719
and

903
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,079
and this is the majority of this

904
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,719
probably eighty percent of uh users and

905
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,480
why we need the cars so

906
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,320
so i think that we also probably shift

907
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,280
in our in our mindset to this segment

908
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,760
and and this issue and this would also

909
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,719
in terms of charging infrastructure

910
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,239
i think that the charge infrastructure

911
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,320
should be much more decentralized

912
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,239
meaning every

913
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,040
lamp post and at homes and work et

914
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,760
cetera there should be the ac charges i

915
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,719
mean

916
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,560
and uh it should be kind of habit of

917
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,599
people to come and pluck your car into

918
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,280
in into the ac charger or plug yes in at

919
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,399
your home or

920
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,160
or or office

921
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,400
and it's done then

922
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,640
then it's not so much heavy

923
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,520
heavy impact on on the grid itself yes

924
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,440
and there are technologies now which can

925
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,240
actually uh utilize the free available

926
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,640
electricity in the in the grid when this

927
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,800
is done in a kind of modern way and

928
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,760
distributed but please

929
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,079
really

930
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,200
i think we need

931
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,520
the microphone yes

932
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,839
i'm always getting nervous if

933
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,839
politicians decide on technology

934
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,200
and i was in in politics for long did

935
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,839
you decide about technology no uh the

936
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,000
question yeah we did the question is

937
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,920
for me

938
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,440
mobility

939
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
or emobility is not the only single

940
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,040
solution

941
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960
there is other solutions

942
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,040
also existing

943
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,280
and i think we should be we have to have

944
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,920
an open mind what's the best solution

945
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,880
and there is no one-size-fits-all

946
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,119
you have just mentioned the urban areas

947
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,079
whereas versus the the countryside we

948
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,079
have never talked about the heavy

949
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,359
transport

950
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,680
we have never talked about shipping we

951
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,440
have never talked about planes and i'm

952
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,160
absolutely nervous if i'm just hearing

953
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,839
immobility

954
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,599
there is something beyond

955
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,040
and second

956
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,359
i would really love to understand better

957
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,440
what's the consequences of all of that

958
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,280
because i know a figure from the country

959
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,520
i know best it's austria

960
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,079
if we go in this direction of fit for 55

961
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,400
we have to double

962
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,680
the installed capacity in electricity in

963
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
in production

964
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,160
to double

965
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,000
do you know what this means

966
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,280
within a

967
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,920
nuclear power plant in austria within a

968
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,160
very short period of time

969
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,920
and that's absolutely

970
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,960
that's that's for me the big question

971
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,359
do we manage this in this very short

972
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,800
period of time

973
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
is this realistic

974
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,000
i want to understand better

975
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,839
yeah maybe i jump on that just uh

976
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,440
briefly because it obviously touches

977
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,000
also a quick discussion we had

978
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,079
this is very much also bmw's position

979
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,160
you know give us a target and leave it

980
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,000
to the industry who

981
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,160
understands usually the market and the

982
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,400
customer

983
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,320
what what the translation of that target

984
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,839
into technology and product then

985
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:25,440
ultimately is

986
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,480
you know because one thing is certain

987
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,720
if you have a beautiful electric car

988
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,480
and you cannot charge it the customer

989
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,240
won't buy it and that nothing has been

990
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,760
done for the climate in that regard you

991
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,200
know it just doesn't

992
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,040
doesn't render any solutions and the

993
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
profile that you were describing you

994
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,880
know 80 to 100 kilometers is the usual

995
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,400
you know the average in germany and i

996
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
think that's more or less european by

997
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,800
the same 36 kilometers that's your what

998
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,040
you do usually yeah and they're the

999
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
plug-in hybrid which is not a full

1000
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,520
battery electric vehicle but a battery

1001
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,280
and internal combustion engine vehicle

1002
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,560
that can run

1003
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
up to 80 kilometers already today with

1004
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,040
bmw products and obviously enhancing

1005
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,440
over time the plug-in hybrid can be part

1006
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,680
of the technology mix as well

1007
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,079
and yes bmw for example is also

1008
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,079
investing in hydrogen vehicles yeah

1009
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,760
which then again can be part of the

1010
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,800
solution and yes we discussed that

1011
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,839
e-fuels so fuels liquid fuels based on

1012
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,200
electricities

1013
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,359
are yes controversial in in in the

1014
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:25,200
question of how much primary energy you

1015
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,599
put in enzymation but we are at an early

1016
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,359
stage here and we should give that

1017
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,760
technology a chance to develop as we did

1018
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,200
by the way with the battery vehicle so

1019
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,960
i'm totally with you techno

1020
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,680
technological neutrality

1021
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,839
is very important

1022
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,680
on the grid side i'm a little bit more

1023
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,760
optimistic i understand and that's why i

1024
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,119
was saying the transformation is

1025
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,359
happening the question is which speed

1026
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,079
which which at which time what time we

1027
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,320
do we allow for the transformation but

1028
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,800
i'm optimistic that

1029
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,359
we can manage it but it's a huge task

1030
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,280
there's no question it's a huge task

1031
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,680
that usually runs undercover because

1032
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,440
everybody's only talking about the car

1033
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,599
nobody's talking about what comes behind

1034
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,280
it

1035
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,720
thank you very much i would like to move

1036
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,520
for mary and uh

1037
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,599
for the part of your question why we

1038
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,200
talk about individual road

1039
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,440
transportation rather than

1040
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,920
planes of course there's still problems

1041
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,200
uh

1042
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,119
regarding emissions

1043
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,560
individual road transport is the biggest

1044
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,119
emittant of of co2 emissions that's why

1045
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,400
we basically talk more about individual

1046
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,320
transportation rather than

1047
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,800
planes and trains and heavy transport i

1048
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,280
think it's a good segue into uh let's

1049
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
shift from road because we don't have

1050
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,640
much time we have maybe five minutes to

1051
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,760
railway

1052
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,160
this is the thing we again talking about

1053
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
roads and we have no time for railways

1054
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
that's true

1055
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
and we had this wonderful ride from uh

1056
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,520
next time

1057
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,680
let's start with rallies

1058
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,320
but uh minister once we we have you and

1059
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,760
i i know you're a big supporter of

1060
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,640
railways as the new clean transport and

1061
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,560
uh transforming slovakia from kind of

1062
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,480
road dependent into railway dependent

1063
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,480
and this is really a congratulation of

1064
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,040
that and thank you for this effort how

1065
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,800
how how do you see the situation do you

1066
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,319
have enough support in the government

1067
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,680
and budget

1068
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,960
no international community no

1069
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,040
[Laughter]

1070
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,119
now we all talk we all talk about how we

1071
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,280
are supporting the the railway

1072
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,359
transportation but we only talk

1073
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,599
the the state budget

1074
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,680
i'm talking about opex the state budget

1075
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,839
for the for the railway infrastructure

1076
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,599
is at the level of 2016.

1077
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,280
thanks to eu funds thanks to the rrf

1078
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,119
actually this is the only good thing on

1079
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,800
poverty is the recovery fund

1080
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,640
[Laughter]

1081
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,599
oh i'm serious without recovery and

1082
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,599
resilience fund because we do plan to

1083
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,000
invest half a billion of euros to the

1084
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,680
railway infrastructure

1085
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,319
without that i don't have answer

1086
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,040
what would we do uh in slovakia of

1087
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,119
course in combination with classical eu

1088
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,760
funds and with chef funding

1089
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,440
we will be able to

1090
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,160
invest to the slovak railway

1091
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,800
infrastructure

1092
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,599
but still the government's

1093
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,560
way of thinking is

1094
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,520
like

1095
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,119
let's talk about it let's talk about

1096
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,800
that it's a greenway let's talk about

1097
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,160
it's the only sustainable way of

1098
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,760
transport

1099
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,079
but when it comes to the budget

1100
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,160
it's not a priority we have to be very

1101
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,680
honest with you

1102
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,000
so i need all the help from all the

1103
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,240
stakeholders to to help me to convince

1104
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,839
the government

1105
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,599
that the rail infrastructure is really

1106
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,839
important

1107
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,359
the thing is that

1108
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:54,960
very interesting information i mentioned

1109
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,800
it actually last year also

1110
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
if we

1111
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,040
manage to do the reconstruction

1112
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,280
reconstruction of existing

1113
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,119
railway infrastructure

1114
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:09,839
to the original speeds

1115
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,920
with the same amount of trains we have

1116
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,960
now we could double the amount of

1117
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
transported passengers

1118
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,760
just by having higher frequency of of

1119
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,119
trains to be

1120
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,480
you know faster

1121
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,800
so this is why we need to invest

1122
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,880
to the infrastructure thank you thank

1123
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,200
you so appeal to everybody here to push

1124
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,599
your parliamentarians and people you

1125
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,560
know

1126
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,720
for more more support and more financing

1127
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,560
for railway but i i believe maybe

1128
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,480
liliana has some answer

1129
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,200
we're here for you we have uh available

1130
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,920
indeed financing because investments in

1131
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,160
railway infrastructure on on one side

1132
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,240
and of course modernization of the of

1133
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,680
the rolling stock

1134
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,599
is is a high priority for us this is 100

1135
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,560
green

1136
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,839
green

1137
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,160
investment something which we promote a

1138
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,880
lot and it's not only about passenger

1139
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,319
trains as you as you mentioned because

1140
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,560
it's about also supporting also

1141
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,599
supporting

1142
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,520
freight operators

1143
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,640
because if we want to be competitive as

1144
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,800
a region this region but overall europe

1145
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,440
and also for for uh international trade

1146
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,240
we do need to have a comprehensive uh

1147
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,200
infrastructure uh adapted to be to be

1148
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,920
able to reach ports and to to have to

1149
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,240
further develop the the whole thing

1150
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,839
network connecting uh ports airports but

1151
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,200
also is

1152
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,599
as part of the discussion apart from

1153
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,240
roads uh and and the rail of course rail

1154
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,200
is very important element of the uh of

1155
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,440
the equation but also investments in

1156
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,079
so-called lower carbon transport

1157
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,440
tramways

1158
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,880
uh

1159
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,960
trolley buses metro light light rails uh

1160
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,079
in the in the cities is also critical if

1161
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,319
we want to achieve

1162
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,720
not only reduction of the co2 emissions

1163
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,359
but really

1164
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,720
promoting green green mobility in

1165
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,960
in cities and this is this is another

1166
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,280
element we are financing we have

1167
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,599
increased uh significantly our

1168
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,160
investments by 10 percent in in this uh

1169
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,560
the the low carbon transport and we're

1170
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,200
investing more than seven billion of raw

1171
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,400
in rail and low transport so funding is

1172
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,119
available of course it's a matter of of

1173
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,200
preparing or preparing good good

1174
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,599
projects to go thank you ministers a few

1175
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,839
words uh maybe a good project would be

1176
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,160
uh we have a common initiative within

1177
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,640
the v4 countries

1178
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,960
of having a high speed train connecting

1179
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,800
all the major cities in the in the

1180
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,680
within the v4 countries might be a good

1181
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,520
good project for financing

1182
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,160
but i have to say another thing uh you

1183
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,480
