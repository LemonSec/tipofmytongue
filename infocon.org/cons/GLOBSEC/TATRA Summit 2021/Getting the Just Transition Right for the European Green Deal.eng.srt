1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
based in bratislava so we have three

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,520
european capitals represented here and

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,759
three very interesting people to talk

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,360
about this subject which is a subject

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,759
that dominated the german elections to

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,599
some degree i live in berlin my name is

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,680
terry martin i'm a i'm a television news

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,560
anchor and broadcast journalist and i of

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,240
course covered the german election i've

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,880
covered many german elections but this

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,320
german election was interesting in the

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,599
sense that

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:28,560
how

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,359
we can push the green agenda through in

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,840
light of the climate emergency as it's

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
described

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,920
while still preserving social and

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,200
economic stability now and prosperity

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,000
for germany very important uh and that's

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
that's a big part of what we're going to

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,360
be talking about this morning so

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,120
what we're talking about the title first

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,879
of all for you so uh we're all on the

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,960
same page getting the just transition

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
right of the uh for the european green

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,360
deal but what are we talking about when

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,840
we say just transition uh we're actually

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,079
talking about two two things

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,520
first of all we're talking about the

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,000
concept just transition this has been

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,400
around for a while it comes from the

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
labor movement actually it's still very

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,159
important for the labor movement for

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
obvious reasons

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159
but it's two things it's that and it's

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,240
also a mechanism in the european context

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,960
first the concept uh the concept is

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,119
basically making sure that

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,920
in the movement towards the greening of

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,759
the economy and this is everywhere

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,759
we have to make sure that no one is left

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,320
behind no region is left behind

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,000
basically so it's about providing

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
opportunities for

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,040
regions for

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,720
businesses for workers as they

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
transition away from carbon intensive

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,759
uh activities we're talking here of

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,320
course about fossil fuels coal

50
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,799
fossil fuel extraction and energy

51
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,960
production metals cement chemicals all

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
those things that produce a lot of co2

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
and there are a lot of those industries

54
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,600
around particularly in this region so

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,280
it's a great significance to the central

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
and eastern european regions also so

57
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,360
that's first thing the concept and

58
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
that's general this is a this is an

59
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,440
important concept in the united states

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,760
it's a it's a concept in china it's a

61
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
it's an important issue everywhere

62
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
because if it's not done right it can

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,800
create disruption in a really negative

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,440
way okay so the second thing is um

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,000
because we're talking about this idea of

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,160
green of of just transition in the

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,879
context of the european green deal and

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,640
in that context in the european green

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,400
deal there is something called

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
the mechanism the just transition

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,040
mechanism and the just it has three

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,519
parts to it first most important part

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,640
perhaps is the just transition fund just

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,440
transition fund provides 17.5 billion in

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
in grants it all there's also a private

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,680
investment scheme that's attached to it

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,000
and a public sector loan facility so

78
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,519
it's a bit complicated but i just i feel

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,720
it's important to say that in the

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,560
context of the european green deal

81
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,239
because that's what we're relating the

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,760
idea of of

83
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,760
just transition to so enough of that um

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,040
i would say only one more thing about

85
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,959
that and that is that when

86
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:07,920
this

87
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,120
when the green deal was being put

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,120
together there was initially a lot more

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
money uh set aside in the proposals for

90
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,080
the just transition this got slashed

91
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
significantly

92
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
much to the chagrin of those who of

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,280
course were pushing for but this is not

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
uncommon in a european budget

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,200
round

96
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,319
good so enough of that enough of me uh

97
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,400
let's bring in the three of you i'd like

98
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
to i'd like to first start um with linda

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,959
and nadya

100
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,200
because we the audience might not be

101
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,519
that familiar with the institutions or

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,200
the the groups that you work with the

103
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,720
the organizations maybe tell us a little

104
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,519
bit about what it is you do how you plug

105
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,480
into the idea of a just transition why

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,280
it matters to you and your clients

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
starting here

108
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,439
thank you um it's a pleasure to be here

109
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,000
um so i'm the ceo of

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,439
new think tank

111
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,120
i guess after a year i still get the

112
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,959
pleasure to call it that

113
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,760
it's a product-based institution that

114
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
focuses on

115
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
technical expertise in sustainable

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,519
finance topics and

117
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,680
one of our main work streams actually is

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
just transition

119
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,238
so what we do is this part research part

120
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,600
convening but

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,519
what we have found out through our

122
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,000
initial research work across the region

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
is

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
that actually the understanding of just

125
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,360
transition and what it requires to do it

126
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,240
properly is still lacking we are also

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,639
lacking capacities

128
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,440
the just transition mechanism as such

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,840
does have some capacity building built

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
into it

131
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,440
and there's a variety of actors and

132
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,840
we're only now finalizing the pillar

133
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,560
number one of just transition mechanism

134
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
which was all about grants

135
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,759
and what we did we thought well

136
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,759
just transition as you correctly

137
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,240
mentioned is not just about

138
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,000
the just transition mechanism or about

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,840
shifting away from coal

140
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,759
eventually we will need to decarbonize

141
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,320
all industries so let's just remember

142
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,639
that and if we're going to do that

143
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,639
we need to get it right we need to have

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,120
a much more holistic view and as our

145
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
host from globesick keep reminding us

146
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,960
it's also about public-private

147
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,520
partnerships because the just transition

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,199
mechanism doesn't have enough money in

149
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,160
it

150
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,880
the grants are tiny to be systematically

151
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,240
important

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,479
the second pillar of course has loan

153
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,360
mechanisms and um much more blending

154
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
facility but we need to figure out what

155
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
are the key things that we need to

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,199
invest in

157
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,960
and from the examples that we've looked

158
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,400
across from

159
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,479
all across the world the ones that have

160
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
worked best actually are public private

161
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
but they're also national regional and

162
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,199
local

163
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,960
and they're really big volumes of

164
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
investment

165
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
so that's going to be really interesting

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,199
to see how we do this because inevitably

167
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,360
we need to decarbonize we are in europe

168
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
that's not going to change

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
the direction of travel is clear and i

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,160
think that for us it's really important

171
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,039
that we look at the different tiers and

172
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,120
the different things that need to happen

173
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,199
and sadly what we have found out is that

174
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,120
the financial literacy and actually

175
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
capacities at the regional level from

176
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,560
local

177
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,080
actors such as municipalities and

178
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,840
different levels of government there

179
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,319
isn't necessarily enough

180
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,199
information flow and capacities to

181
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,680
support local smes and projects

182
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,080
sufficiently so we will need much more

183
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,479
help and much more investment but if we

184
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,240
get it right i think there's huge

185
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,639
opportunities for jobs

186
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,800
also for some positive impact and to

187
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,120
avoid what i call the second

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,800
wicked problem of our time which is

189
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,520
inequality because inequality creates

190
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
political volatility it creates a lot of

191
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,120
negative externalities that also affect

192
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,000
our climate ambition so i think it's not

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,240
nice to have

194
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,880
it's a must-have and now there's also a

195
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,400
new term equitable transition

196
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
so i think it's going to be a heating up

197
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,160
topic so i'm really glad to see it on

198
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
the agenda here

199
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,720
great um what i think is very valuable

200
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,319
you know that you you are here and also

201
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
that the the two of you but but that

202
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,680
you're we have two people from the

203
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,599
region who are working in this region

204
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
serving the interests of of this region

205
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,199
so um

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,919
nadia you're in you're in bratislava yes

207
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,440
um you you you know the region well um

208
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,800
tell us i mean the same thing about you

209
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,720
what does your what does your

210
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,639
organization do in plugging into this

211
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,160
how important is it for your for your

212
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,639
clients and your activities and kind of

213
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,000
you know what are you dealing in terms

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,479
of doing in terms of concrete engagement

215
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,919
with this topic okay so our company is

216
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,879
energy solutions or energy contracting

217
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,280
company and this means that we want to

218
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,680
help businesses and the governments to

219
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
achieve the climate targets which were

220
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,000
set by the green deal

221
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,960
and we have two very strong shareholders

222
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,759
who

223
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,160
are basically directly involved and must

224
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,960
decarbonize them themselves so it's pepe

225
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,639
which is a national gas provider in

226
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,960
slovakia the 100 percent state owned and

227
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,120
chess escond this is the same company in

228
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
czech republic which was created by by

229
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,280
big chess that has a big transition

230
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,240
scheme

231
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,039
how to basically change the

232
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,720
coal-powered uh

233
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
electric power power plants to the

234
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,399
electric ones

235
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,919
so

236
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,519
we basically need uh to see uh how to

237
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,479
use the just transition fund

238
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,640
but because it concerns smes mainly this

239
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,760
should be the tool how our customers can

240
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,800
help

241
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
find that they can get a financial help

242
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,160
basically to to invest for their

243
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,000
investments

244
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,959
in the decarbonization but as we said

245
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,480
it's a tricky scheme so there's not too

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,519
much clarity uh how to use it

247
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,080
and because there is silence and

248
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
recovery facility now it got even more

249
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,959
complicated so

250
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,240
we are normally able to to advise what

251
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,720
is available on the market which grants

252
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,120
they can use and we can also help them

253
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,160
sometimes to prepare their applications

254
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
for the right solutions for them but

255
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,839
right now

256
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,320
there's not much willingness

257
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
on the market or not much believe that

258
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
the just transition fund will help

259
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
effectively to support the

260
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,240
regions

261
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
on the other hand what we can see in

262
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,240
slovakia and initially this was supposed

263
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,920
to support

264
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
mainly the region of horna nitra but now

265
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,200
there are a lot of discussions to extend

266
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
it for the for the whole country

267
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,200
or to them to most of the of the regions

268
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,760
so if the implementation will be right

269
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,079
and if the scheme will will be right in

270
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,880
india and it can really help

271
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,040
it sounds like you know there is first

272
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,839
of all the confidence uh you know issue

273
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,320
do is there confidence in in the

274
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,360
uh just transition fund the mechanism to

275
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,839
to actually help but there's also a

276
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,760
knowledge gap you know there's a there's

277
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,279
a um a learning curve when it comes to

278
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,160
plugging into the mechanism but also

279
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,079
uh the concept of just transition as a

280
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,560
whole i'm just wondering as it as a term

281
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,720
if you i don't normally do this i'm not

282
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,320
a person who asks people to raise their

283
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
hands and tell me what they think but i

284
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
in this case i'm i'm really curious uh

285
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,480
if if each of you here in the audience

286
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
will just raise your hand if you are

287
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,040
familiar with the with the concept by

288
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
that term just transition or and the the

289
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
mechanism in the european union just how

290
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
many is it on your agenda i mean be

291
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,399
honest

292
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,760
okay yeah so maybe half the room yeah

293
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
maybe maybe half the room here of

294
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,160
extremely well educated people who are

295
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,320
plugging into to the policy community

296
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,640
and dealing and in this region where it

297
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,720
has some significance

298
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
very interesting um

299
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,360
so i want to bring you in beyond uh

300
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,560
we we know your institution uh your bank

301
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,640
and it's been very active of course in

302
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,440
this region for a long time uh as in the

303
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
rest of europe but the um

304
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,279
i'm wondering where it is on you know on

305
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,600
your agenda and how your bank can

306
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
can help you know if if it can help are

307
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,160
there you know is it on is it something

308
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
that your bank is really working on uh

309
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,040
actively as a as a policy portfolio for

310
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,399
your clients

311
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,480
thank you very much terry pleasure to be

312
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,959
joining you today so i represent the

313
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,000
ebrd we think of ourselves as a green

314
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,279
bank

315
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,240
we've made a commitment to direct

316
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,519
more than half of our investment towards

317
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,000
green issues um

318
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,240
and we we work mainly with private

319
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,639
sector about three quarters of our

320
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,160
activities

321
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,880
are

322
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
or should be directed to private sector

323
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,839
that's the commitment we make so we

324
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
support

325
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,920
low carbon transition but that obviously

326
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
means that we need to support just

327
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,040
transition so just to give you types of

328
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,360
activities we engage in

329
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
in egypt

330
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,639
we invested 500 million dollars um

331
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,360
to

332
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
create or to in a solar park

333
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,240
largest solar park on the african

334
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
continent in poland we invested 250

335
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
million euros

336
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,720
to support construction of a

337
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,160
battery giga factory

338
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,040
in slovakia we support

339
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,639
financing of installation of buildings

340
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,279
municipal residential buildings so these

341
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,079
are things we do to

342
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,160
support

343
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,079
decarbonization but of course

344
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,560
the flip side of that is that as you

345
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,880
support low carbon transition you need

346
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,519
to worry about winners and losers

347
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,079
um so you've already mentioned coal

348
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,720
because in our region call is very uh

349
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,560
prominent more than a third of

350
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,800
mongolia's exports come

351
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,360
from coal

352
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,079
more than two percent of total

353
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,279
employment in kazakhstan is in call 2.5

354
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,920
percent of total employment uh in bosnia

355
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,440
and herzegovina so um a lot of times um

356
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,399
coal coal coal mining is owned by

357
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,560
state-owned enterprises

358
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,519
and that in some ways makes things both

359
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,839
easier and more difficult right it makes

360
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
it easier because the government can um

361
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,680
act directly so we are very active in

362
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,160
supporting governance of state-owned

363
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,560
enterprises

364
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,519
i think it's no secret to anyone that

365
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,920
rules and regulations governing

366
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,240
state-owned enterprises

367
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
in transition countries are sub-optimal

368
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,279
we actually did an analysis comparing

369
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,320
soe

370
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,959
regulatory framework to what oecd

371
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,959
considers to be the best practice and

372
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,320
you know the picture is not pretty so

373
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,360
that's one area now the second area is

374
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,160
you know if you think about coal regions

375
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,000
and closing coal mines that obviously

376
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
the impact goes obviously beyond just

377
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
the miners it's it's the region itself

378
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,440
and its neighboring regions two weeks

379
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,240
ago i talked to the mayor of zabja and

380
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,800
she mentioned to me that luckily her

381
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
city has the period of closing coal

382
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,399
mines behind itself you know they did

383
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
experience very high unemployment at

384
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,360
that time

385
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,680
that's behind them but now they are

386
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,480
bracing themselves for the impact from

387
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,639
other regions that will have to go

388
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,040
through this transition so the question

389
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,839
is how do you make

390
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,639
create business opportunities and we do

391
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,480
it for instance by

392
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,360
um

393
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,920
providing sme credit we work with

394
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,399
financial institutions in many countries

395
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,040
and these financial institutions um

396
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,000
extend sme credit on our behalf often

397
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,839
this is uh

398
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,720
targeting women entrepreneurs

399
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,320
the third part is you want to make it

400
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,759
easier for firms to adjust now

401
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,759
we need to produce things in a different

402
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,880
way it is much easier for a large

403
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,399
profitable

404
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,920
firm to

405
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,079
undertake the necessary investment to

406
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,880
adjust to low-carbon future it's much

407
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,920
more difficult for sme because of lack

408
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,320
of funding so we also support sme credit

409
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,199
for green purposes as well okay that's

410
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,320
great

411
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,240
i'd like to open the floor for questions

412
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,720
because we the whole session is about 40

413
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,399
is 45 minutes long we have about we're

414
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,880
still about 24 minutes i'll come back in

415
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,639
a bit but uh we have one question here

416
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,839
in the front i'd like to collect a

417
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,199
couple of questions if there are other

418
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,720
questions uh could you please just raise

419
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,560
your hand we have uh i hope somebody

420
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,759
yeah we have someone with a microphone

421
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,759
who's coming around uh are there other

422
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,040
questions just so maybe we can collect

423
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
them yeah there's a second one in the

424
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,120
second row a third one um a third one in

425
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,959
the third row perfect

426
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,720
thank you very much uh

427
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,199
my name is martin hoisie i'm an mep

428
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,399
and uh

429
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,920
first

430
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,199
uh remark i think that what and with the

431
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,120
whole just transition concept and the

432
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,399
money that the

433
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,759
union is putting into just transition

434
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,399
i think this is an unprecedented step

435
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,680
because

436
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,360
when in early 90s lots of the old

437
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,759
industries in our region fell

438
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,240
there was no just transition

439
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,000
and we managed

440
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,839
uh when

441
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,160
the car industry in early the 20 uh 20th

442
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,480
century came about and the entire horse

443
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
carriage industry collapsed within 10

444
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,280
years there was no just transition

445
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,000
so i want us to be aware that this is

446
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
something where

447
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,280
and i'm not disputing it i think it's

448
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,720
really really important but i want us to

449
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,559
be aware that this is something which

450
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,520
uh is quite a bit of extra not kind of a

451
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,760
or minimum safety net

452
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,520
uh and i think that we should be proud

453
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,799
of it

454
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,720
uh but a specific weather question two

455
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,480
men and we are watching in ebrd i'm very

456
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
happy to hear that uh ebrd is focusing

457
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,960
now it's landing on on the climate uh

458
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
friendly project i wonder to which

459
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,679
extent it also extends to the loan

460
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
facilities where you launch the banks

461
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,919
which are then in meet intermediaries so

462
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
which criteria you set up there and

463
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,679
second whether you're planning to use

464
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,160
the taxonomy of sustainable investments

465
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,280
uh as one of the criterias or possibly

466
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
the screening criteria vis-a-vis

467
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
there will be delegated act on

468
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,280
the circular economy there'll be

469
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,679
delegated act on biodiversity so whether

470
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,840
you're planning to use this

471
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,160
instrument as something which will help

472
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,320
you to kind of screen the project that

473
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,960
will require mandatory disclosure uh

474
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,200
under the taxonomy regulation thank you

475
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
thank you so a question for people

476
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,480
you've probably you'll register that

477
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
we're going to collect these three

478
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,840
questions and then allow our panelists

479
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,919
to answer so in the second row

480
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,880
there was a question

481
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,480
was it the gentleman there yes i thought

482
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,039
so yeah

483
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,880
thank you my name is peter kremsky chair

484
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
of the economic committee of slovak

485
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,879
parliament

486
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,360
you mentioned

487
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
two things idea and mechanism

488
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,960
the idea is very nice and like it

489
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,280
we all of us like

490
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,400
clean green world like outside there we

491
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
can see

492
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
but the mechanism

493
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,679
i see

494
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,559
a lot of green washing and a lot of

495
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,320
hypocrisy in the green transition

496
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,840
first example electricity production

497
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,520
in germany they

498
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,120
stopped or are stopping will stop soon

499
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,039
their nuclear power plants

500
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,400
and instead

501
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,880
the electricity will be produced in gas

502
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,480
power plants or in coal power plants

503
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,679
by this price of electricity probably

504
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,480
many of the coal power plants must be

505
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
started again

506
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,080
because the electricity will

507
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,160
go through the sky otherwise

508
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,600
second

509
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,160
example uh european commission is

510
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,799
pushing on

511
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
forbidding of fossil cars we can say

512
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,879
in 5 or 10 years

513
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
but the

514
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,559
electric cars are mostly produced in

515
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,880
china the batteries are mostly produced

516
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,960
in china the technology and the

517
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
knowledge in china

518
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,360
and what we can see now in automotive

519
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,440
industry is that

520
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,480
that

521
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,240
some of the

522
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,840
products

523
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,200
are

524
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,799
very problematic

525
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,840
and

526
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,640
tens of thousands of cars are waiting

527
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,400
somewhere on the parking place in the

528
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,159
factory for one part or two parts

529
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,280
and

530
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,919
you can wait for a car

531
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,400
eight months twelve months and

532
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,159
soon probably

533
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,159
we will be happy to produce any cars

534
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,240
to have some cars okay so

535
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
that's the problem and in the

536
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,600
carbon carbon produce

537
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,200
producing is in coal power plants in

538
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,039
industry but we will forbid the fossil

539
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,320
cars so that's that's my hope this is my

540
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,880
idea i would like to listen to your

541
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
opinion about this okay so it's

542
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,799
basically a question about as you said

543
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,120
at the beginning you know hypocrisy in

544
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,039
this whole enterprise and and

545
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,039
greenwashing and maybe

546
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,760
the lack of feasibility or lack of

547
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
actually you know planning

548
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
good uh maybe that someone can get a

549
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,880
response to that as well and in the

550
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
third row uh here in

551
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,799
the third question and then we'll come

552
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,640
back to the panel here

553
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,400
thank you very much good morning my name

554
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,840
is peter balik from the ministry of

555
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
investment responsible for

556
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,960
the implementation of the just

557
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,120
transition fund in slovakia

558
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,039
which takes 459 million euro for for our

559
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,840
country for two regions for sure upper

560
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,760
new trias has been mentioned in the

561
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,360
kosciutz region

562
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,200
in the east we are right now in the

563
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,799
middle of negotiations regarding the

564
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,600
third region banska bistritza region

565
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,360
but the transformation potential is

566
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,039
quite questionable in in the region

567
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,559
mainly because most of the heavy

568
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,080
industry players in the basketball

569
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,200
street region already underwent a

570
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,280
transformation in the past so they

571
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,080
invested a lot in new technologies

572
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,520
and that's why the european commission

573
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,919
is quite hesitant to support this region

574
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,159
even though the transition already

575
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,159
happened before but the impact is still

576
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,400
there so we are also

577
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,720
confronting a lot of opinions from this

578
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
particular region that we are talking

579
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,039
right now about an unjust transition

580
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,000
fund because the european commission is

581
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,320
quite hesitant to to support this this

582
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,480
third region in slovakia so maybe a

583
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,440
question

584
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,799
on that how to

585
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,600
really persuade the commission

586
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,080
to to make this particular region a

587
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
legible one even though the

588
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,679
transformation has undergone there but

589
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,320
there are still remaining challenges

590
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
maybe the next question would be related

591
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,120
to

592
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,440
the financing we are

593
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
very much

594
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,720
confronted with the

595
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,320
high industries in upper nitra and in

596
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,919
kosher region as well mainly u.s steel

597
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,919
which are quite hesitant to use

598
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,840
financial instruments from the second

599
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,520
and third pillar of the of the just

600
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,039
transition

601
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,159
mechanism uh they are mostly interested

602
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,840
in the grand mechanism which is of

603
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,159
course uh understandable but maybe what

604
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,400
is the case in other western european

605
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,760
countries is there appetite for

606
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,880
financial instruments uh on the side of

607
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,720
the large industries which really need

608
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,240
to undergo uh the the transition so

609
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,600
thank you

610
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,640
thank you all uh we i'm hoping once we

611
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,080
finish this round we'll still have some

612
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,919
space for some other questions so uh

613
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,600
please raise your hand i'll i'll

614
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,760
acknowledge that there's one already in

615
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,840
the second row another in the second row

616
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,520
for for this next round of questions and

617
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,120
over here in the second row very good

618
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,400
okay we'll come back to you first we're

619
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,320
going to to field these questions i'd

620
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,400
like to start with you uh biatum because

621
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,960
uh or no no with linda rather responding

622
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,880
to what we just heard since it's fresh

623
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
and it applies to the region and it's

624
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
it's a very concrete uh question from a

625
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
policymaker who's involved in this the

626
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,960
uh the salient term coming out of that

627
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
statement for me was the

628
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,760
notion that there's an unjust transition

629
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,200
um and curious how maybe um maybe the

630
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,279
region can plug into this in a more

631
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,799
constructive way

632
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,640
thank you i'll try to be quick and maybe

633
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,559
hit a couple of the points that were

634
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,880
raised i think it's a very interesting

635
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,080
question right unjust transition um i

636
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,840
don't think the mechanism will ever be

637
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,840
perfect and

638
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,440
who knows in the future it might be

639
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
revised then we might have to have much

640
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,960
more financial support

641
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
for a variety of decarbonization

642
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
activities and for certain communities

643
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,919
being hit

644
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,720
hardest in certain industries

645
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,120
i think a big issue that you mentioned

646
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,120
is it better in the rest of the region

647
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,520
or elsewhere well actually

648
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,080
the v4 is not looking particularly great

649
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,919
nobody likes loans

650
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,600
you also see that in the recovery and

651
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,840
resilience

652
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,320
case it's predominantly give us a grant

653
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,640
and then we'll see

654
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,880
that we need to change we need to start

655
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,400
thinking about how we develop our

656
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,880
capital markets better how we bundle

657
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,159
different uh projects and go for scale

658
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,960
because often these investment tickets

659
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,600
as we called in investing are very small

660
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,880
so you need to figure out how you're

661
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
going to improve the conditions there

662
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,880
in terms of why is there so much green

663
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
washing

664
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
that's why we have the green taxonomy

665
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,960
right the idea was to compare apples

666
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,600
with apples so we don't have these

667
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,840
ridiculous situations where you see a

668
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,440
lot of green washing

669
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
it's not easy to root it out completely

670
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,480
at least it starts setting some standard

671
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,600
it's

672
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,080
ideally science based of course we have

673
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,679
issues that we can discuss separately

674
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,159
about the taxonomy it's a big topic

675
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:46,960
but

676
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
up until now what we've had is what i

677
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,960
call the low hanging fruit approach

678
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,440
where you do the easy decarbonization so

679
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,520
electric car easy

680
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
put some solar panels and have green

681
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
energy that you can then report in your

682
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,240
sustainability report easy

683
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,000
but i think what's also changing

684
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,640
massively is the data space and as we

685
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,720
have more data we try to gather more

686
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,480
data we have better technology to

687
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,159
potentially also get

688
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,400
not only self-reported data but other

689
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,520
types of data about different um

690
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
businesses we should start getting a

691
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,919
little bit better at

692
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,320
actually finding what are companies

693
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,559
doing and where the impact is so there's

694
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,559
amazing projects by google and others

695
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,320
that actually show

696
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,080
a variety of different data that you can

697
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,159
use for figuring out what is happening

698
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,679
on the ground and that is changing very

699
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,559
rapidly but of course these things take

700
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,840
time

701
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,679
and in terms of the

702
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,919
you know we had all these industrial

703
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,760
revolutions before and people just got

704
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,960
left behind

705
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,039
well let's be realistic people are going

706
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,360
to get left behind that's just not going

707
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,240
to change we should be honest about that

708
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,679
but we're already leaving a lot of

709
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,600
people behind in terms of inequality of

710
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,000
opportunity inequality of income lack of

711
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,640
converge convergence across the eu but i

712
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
think what this region can really bring

713
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,080
to the table again in terms of the

714
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,000
european commission agenda is actually

715
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,840
talking about the social side talking

716
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,000
about the inequality and pushing the

717
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,640
fact that social is directly linked to

718
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,880
climate because if you have opposition

719
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,679
to green if it's seen as biased then

720
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,440
it's going to derail the climate effort

721
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,559
anyway so it's an integral part and many

722
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,120
of you have heard the esg mantra so

723
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,880
environmental social and governance

724
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,559
criteria that's going to save the world

725
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,279
no it's not but eventually it will again

726
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,840
create more data and allow us to see

727
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,919
what the linkages between the s and e

728
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,919
are because at the moment

729
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,520
half of the things we're doing

730
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,039
blindfolded

731
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,640
so it sounds like very much still in a

732
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,960
learning situation but in a way we've

733
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,640
been here before the world has gone

734
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,240
through different industrial revolutions

735
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,679
there have been technological

736
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,279
advancements that have displaced the

737
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,000
previous technologies and with great

738
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,679
disruption uh social and economic

739
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,000
economic disruption but also opportunity

740
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
which i don't want to to forget in this

741
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,799
case that we there are opportunities

742
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,799
here too and from a business perspective

743
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,840
and i know we have have many

744
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,120
representatives of the business

745
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,520
community here among us as well also

746
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,760
bankers and investors uh who are looking

747
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,760
at this um it's important to keep that

748
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
in mind i would say uh nadi would you

749
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,200
care to comment because this was uh

750
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
particularly with regard to what's

751
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,279
happening in this in this region and how

752
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,440
it how it plugs into the uh just

753
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
transition mechanism

754
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,200
well i understand

755
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,159
the remarks and uh especially the region

756
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,919
which is being discussed the region of

757
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,679
banska bistrita

758
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,840
it's i understand why they find it kind

759
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,880
of kind of not fair but where we would

760
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,360
like to see more support from the from

761
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,559
the eu

762
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,919
and this is something what was not

763
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,600
really mentioned by now in the

764
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,679
discussion is upskilling

765
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,760
so we must not forget that all these

766
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
people that are going to leave the the

767
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
heavy industry because of the change in

768
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,320
changes there we must create job

769
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,039
opportunities for them and i think this

770
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,760
is a big part where just transition fund

771
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,960
should help so even if the carbonization

772
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,200
in the region happened

773
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,279
we could support the job opportunities

774
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,840
for the people and create other other

775
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,320
areas where they can find interesting

776
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,279
jobs

777
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,120
and they are here on globsec a lot of

778
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,760
discussions about the danube tech valley

779
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,080
and so on so i think there is a lot of

780
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,200
space

781
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,679
where we can improve the situation uh

782
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,240
right now and i'm personally very glad

783
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,880
to see that it should be extended in in

784
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,279
the slovakian it's not not just the

785
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,679
region of honna nitra

786
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,279
and in respect of this green washing

787
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,360
just one remark i think

788
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,120
i think it's very important that we

789
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,960
don't forget on the purpose of the

790
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,960
projects because i really go a lot

791
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
around the country to meet the potential

792
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,760
customers and sometimes i really hear

793
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,440
funny stories i mean it's saturday

794
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,000
morning so we can have one fun fact so

795
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,559
i know about one sme that they wanted to

796
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,600
apply for the just transition money

797
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
in the future and they wanted to create

798
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,720
a carp farm you know so

799
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,000
it's uh

800
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,960
carp you know for the fish

801
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,600
yeah so so i think it's very it's very

802
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,919
important that we do smart solutions and

803
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,559
low carbon solutions than from from this

804
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,320
money so because then you don't have

805
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,960
this ridiculous discussions okay now the

806
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,360
prices of energy they are tremendously

807
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,640
high let's start the the call factories

808
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
again because this is really what is

809
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,200
what is happening and we see this uh in

810
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,279
more countries and also not only in the

811
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,679
in in the europe so i'm really glad you

812
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,440
did mention upskilling that's not

813
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
something we've talked about i mean it's

814
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,159
also a kind of a strange term but we're

815
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,679
talking about you know training uh

816
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,760
training people and preparing them

817
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,240
with new skills in order to make this

818
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,520
transition from uh carbon intensive

819
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,600
industries into something greener

820
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,919
whatever that may be but it's a it's a

821
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,519
large matrix of policy uh of policies

822
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,039
that need to come together in order to

823
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,519
make this uh to make a just transition

824
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,880
work in any any serious way uh beyota

825
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,480
would you care to comment on absolutely

826
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,120
absolutely so um there was a question

827
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,600
whether we care about sustainability so

828
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,039
let me explain

829
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,279
how we pick our projects

830
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,799
right so

831
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,159
our projects these are loans so we need

832
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,159
to follow the principle of sound banking

833
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,720
right we need we want our money back we

834
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,279
want to be additional meaning we want to

835
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,760
ensure to the extent possible that this

836
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,519
investment would not have happened

837
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,200
without our

838
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,399
involvement

839
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,679
and finally and most importantly

840
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,640
we want our project to lead to some

841
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,120
systemic change we are in the business

842
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,080
of system exchange and that means that

843
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,039
each project is quite rigorously

844
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,559
evaluated

845
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,320
in terms of change it brings in terms of

846
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
the impact it has so it's not just about

847
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,159
giving is investing money it's about

848
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,360
making sure that there is

849
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,880
some transition impact of what we do so

850
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,919
for instance whenever we invest in green

851
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,919
projects we calculate anticipated tons

852
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,000
of co2 emissions that can be saved

853
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,320
we work with capital markets

854
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,120
we try to help develop regulatory

855
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,279
structure for new instruments we are

856
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,039
active in equity space so

857
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,679
we are i would say quite rigorous in the

858
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,080
way we approach our projects is not just

859
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,080
you know pushing money through the door

860
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,559
now on green washing um

861
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,480
and you know just to sum up you can

862
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,039
think of us as impact investor right

863
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,640
because we have either impact on

864
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,159
governance or on green issues or on

865
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,480
equality of opportunities or the level

866
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,240
of competitiveness in the country or

867
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,480
resilience

868
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,960
greenwashing is obviously

869
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,360
a difficult topic

870
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,480
we are active um in green bonds in in

871
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
in for instance recently we issued

872
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,360
first high

873
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,440
yield

874
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,360
sustainability linked bond

875
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,360
in southern europe so this is a bond

876
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,840
we participate in issues of this bond it

877
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,640
was issued by a greek electricity

878
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,480
producer

879
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,600
which committed itself to reducing co2

880
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,840
emissions by 40

881
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,159
by 2023

882
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,200
and if they do not achieve the goal um

883
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,120
their interest rate

884
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,000
will go steeply up right so if you are

885
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
an investor or even a smaller investor

886
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,240
how do you ensure that they have

887
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,640
stuck to this commitment well you would

888
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,679
hope that ebrd gives the seal of

889
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,039
approval um to this deal and that we

890
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,200
lend credibility

891
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,760
to this financial instrument and i think

892
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,320
this role of

893
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,918
organizations like ours in

894
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,960
providing credibility in in giving the

895
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,760
seal of approval is is quite important

896
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,599
because it is a way of unlocking private

897
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,679
financing um that can flow um to various

898
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,560
green projects okay uh it's just we're

899
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,560
kind of short if you don't mind i i had

900
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,159
promised three other people that they'd

901
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,599
be able to ask questions i would like to

902
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,879
like to make that happen if you don't

903
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,960
mind uh so uh

904
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,280
we had three questions in the second row

905
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,119
just raise your hand again uh the

906
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,159
microphone will be brought to you

907
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,199
gentlemen first of all there and then

908
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:48,839
we'll come to you and then

909
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,159
could i ask you about the

910
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,359
uh the broader social impact of

911
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,520
of the winners and new losers of of

912
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,880
transition

913
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,960
because we from from my own experience

914
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,119
as policy maker i mean coal miners will

915
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,680
always be strong enough to uh make sure

916
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,160
they will get the just transition uh

917
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,760
themselves but what about the the

918
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,920
consumers what about the households that

919
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,320
will be faced with more expensive fuel

920
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,880
and what are the winners and losers in a

921
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,680
broader sense um so much the mechanism

922
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,079
but but the the concept

923
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,079
thank you and thank you for being brief

924
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,040
as well because we only have five

925
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,400
minutes i'd like to allow the panelists

926
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,760
to respond so if you could please just

927
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,839
to identify yourself and make make a

928
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,520
brief question thank you very much my

929
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,480
name is andra ferinchikova and i work

930
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,079
for the european investment bank and

931
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,359
happily to be involved with the just

932
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,880
transition mechanism

933
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,680
so

934
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,000
i i had to come in also with maybe a

935
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,240
small command because the eib is indeed

936
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,079
to be one of the main implementers of

937
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,079
the just transition mechanism across the

938
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,480
eu and especially of course the regions

939
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,240
not only that we would be a main

940
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,000
implementing partner for the second

941
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,240
pillar for the invest eu but more or

942
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,320
less we will be the main financing uh

943
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,480
partner for providing the third pillar

944
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,040
that that would be the public of a

945
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,560
landing facility

946
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,680
um but a part of this what i see uh

947
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,599
really important and what what has not

948
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,760
been i had mentioned is the advisory and

949
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,520
this comes also back to the point that

950
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,200
linda was making that there is a lack of

951
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,560
capacity because um even though the

952
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,119
regions or these stakeholders are trying

953
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,920
to prepare the project pipeline but they

954
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,240
are mainly focused on how to spend the

955
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,800
grants how to basically allocate uh the

956
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,079
first pillar

957
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,839
and none of them is really looking on

958
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,839
the way how to really make the change

959
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,359
how to make the transition and how to

960
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,560
utilize maybe some also private capital

961
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
into into this transition so here we are

962
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,680
really putting a lot of emphasis on on

963
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,960
the advisory

964
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,440
and we are trying also to to talk to

965
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,680
them not to be really

966
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,359
um

967
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,119
afraid to to go ahead with the

968
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,280
innovative way of financing it's not

969
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,880
only what kind of projects you will be

970
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,720
financing but the way how you you are

971
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,119
going to finance it so here i believe

972
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,160
that there uh here is big momentum of of

973
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,599
changing this

974
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,960
this approach

975
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,000
and

976
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,480
one short question would be uh to panel

977
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,160
is um

978
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,680
what do you believe should be the legacy

979
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,599
of the program uh because we are

980
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,839
discussing different projects different

981
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,920
different ideas so what should be behind

982
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,280
behind of transition should it be the

983
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,280
new schools new infrastructure you know

984
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
kind of like new mindset so that would

985
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,480
be the question thank you i hope we can

986
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,520
still get to it because i really

987
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,560
appreciate a question from a

988
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,160
practitioner who's very much involved in

989
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
it we only have three minutes left and i

990
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,520
it's my job to make sure this thing ends

991
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,119
on time so if you could please be brief

992
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,960
now you get another one from the abbey

993
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,800
i'm gert weller the head of office in

994
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,160
protest lava

995
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,000
um i don't want to talk about the eab is

996
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,760
doing now i want to talk of what i've

997
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,200
been doing for the eab in lusatia

998
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,480
where we were financing the

999
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,520
rehabilitation of the former gdr lignite

1000
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,720
area

1001
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,520
um

1002
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,599
and in my opinion what really matters in

1003
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,280
the whole process is

1004
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,520
psychology uh you have to take the

1005
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,440
people on board i mean it's nice to

1006
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,760
transform a lignite area into a

1007
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,359
touristic area now

1008
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,400
what is now happening but if you tell a

1009
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,760
52 year

1010
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,119
like i am

1011
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,480
engineer

1012
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,800
well maybe you will be a waiter at a

1013
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,960
tourist resort in the future because

1014
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,800
your job is just has been just become

1015
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
redundant

1016
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,800
so

1017
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,400
please don't forget to take the people

1018
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,320
on board who need to fill the fridges

1019
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
every day despite

1020
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,960
if there's a drop in the knight or not

1021
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,560
thank you that picks up very well on

1022
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,680
what linda was saying about the

1023
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,640
importance of addressing inequality

1024
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,760
we also heard the idea of the need to

1025
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,160
increase capacity for the advisory

1026
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,320
capacities these this needs to be

1027
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,000
improved and we also heard concerns

1028
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,720
expressed about the general impact of of

1029
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,640
the transition towards or the greening

1030
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,560
of the economy and again in the german

1031
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,640
election just now uh in an

1032
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,280
almost issue-free election uh this was

1033
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,200
one of the issues that did actually make

1034
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,040
it onto the agenda was was discussed in

1035
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,800
some serious way during the last minute

1036
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,640
and a half to um would it could any of

1037
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,000
you quickly make a comment that might

1038
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,520
address what these concerns would just

1039
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,160
uh were just mentioned

1040
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,839
in in terms of who will be

1041
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,920
affected i mean it's actually

1042
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,320
quite wide-ranging right so we have

1043
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,640
well-defined groups such as coal miners

1044
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,200
we have regions which are dependent on

1045
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,599
heavy industry and this heavy industry

1046
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,560
may become non-competitive with higher

1047
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,480
carbon prices

1048
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,960
we have poorer households that will be

1049
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,440
facing much higher energy bills and then

1050
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,560
we have this whole you know

1051
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,240
re-allocation of market shares

1052
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,359
from firms that are investing

1053
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:44,480
making

1054
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,599
adjustments to low carbon production and

1055
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,359
you know they are

1056
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,520
increasing their market at the expense

1057
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,200
of firms that are not making adjustments

1058
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,280
so workers need to move and then the

1059
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,640
question is you know all their workers

1060
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,320
right will all their workers would

1061
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,800
be able to move but to your question

1062
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,200
thank you i'm afraid i i need to bring

1063
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,960
in the other two just so just to be fair

1064
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,880
if you i hope you understand thank you

1065
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,280
uh lynn um i just think that in terms of

1066
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,400
who's going to lose and how how do we

1067
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
look at who else is losing out and what

1068
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,800
what is happening i think that the

1069
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,640
social impact assessment is extremely

1070
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,960
important there's already data and

1071
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,520
very good solid science emerging how to

1072
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,040
do that how do you actually measure

1073
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,880
social impact

1074
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,240
and i think that's going to be changing

1075
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,599
and we need to integrate that because

1076
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,280
government should be impact investors

1077
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,720
right you have a social contract to

1078
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,200
uphold and the last thing what should be

1079
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,040
the legacy i think that legacy should be

1080
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,280
the realization that you need

1081
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,359
conceptualized just transition solutions

1082
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,680
per industry per region per country and

1083
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,520
that's something that i think links to

1084
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,720
something called

1085
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,560
shades of green bonds

1086
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
that each instrument needs to be

1087
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,560
different so financing needs to also be

1088
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,960
different in each occasion so we just

1089
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,000
need to

1090
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,040
stop thinking that one solution will fit

1091
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,119
all sizes thank you and

1092
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,599
final word nadio okay so i won't repeat

1093
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:05,760
what was said because i agree basically

1094
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,880
but uh

1095
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,400
on financing uh just a closing remark i

1096
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,319
think it's very important these are not

1097
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:13,680
just uh

1098
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,079
like grants that the private money is

1099
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:18,640
really brought into into the game and

1100
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,520
it's a combination it's a combination of

1101
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,400
the

1102
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,960
uh loan and grants this is very

1103
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,280
important that it's successful in the

1104
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,720
end of the day

1105
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,319

1106

1111
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
deep need to talk about the subject of

1112
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,359
just transition mainly the concept but

1113
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,440
