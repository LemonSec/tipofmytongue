1
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:07,560
symptoms of crisis are not over Europe

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:11,160
is facing important challenges

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,649
internally and externally investment in

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:19,759
Europe is down by more than sixty

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,760
percent reasons for this are diverse

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,869
we saw unprecedented games by an tiny

7
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:35,200
new anti-euro parties on the left on the

8
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:37,269
right in the core as well we either

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,760
regain the trust of the European people

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:43,510
or we lose your forever in situation

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,910
like this we must act and more powerful

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:47,910
Europe today is slowly necessary

13
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,480
they cannot be too comfortable and

14
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:59,480
assume that everything will be fine

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,000
invitation it is quite appropriate and

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,239
talking about politics at this time

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,450
given the political environment it's an

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:11,680
obvious sign that we have no longer West

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,680
is inviting you

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:18,370
I bring our leaders in the understates

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:24,000
the elec audition the clear lack of

22
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:24,000
leadership we can waste time

23
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,770
you
