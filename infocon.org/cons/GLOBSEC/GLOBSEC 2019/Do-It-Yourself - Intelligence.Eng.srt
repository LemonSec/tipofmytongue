00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:09,540
welcome everyone to globe sex

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,910
20:19 panel do-it-yourself intelligence

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,620
and thank you for all being here there

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,070
are some competing panels with

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,049
presidents so we're glad you're here

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,970
we we were just discussing beforehand

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,740
that we're gonna get the real Intel

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:30,150
nerds we hope in this room today we have

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,850
with us starting from this side

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,530
Hans Jakob Schindler he was the senior

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,500
he is the senior director of the counter

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,719
extremism project in New York and he was

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,870
previously a head of the UN

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:47,000
investigations team into Isis or ISIL al

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:51,120
Qaeda and the Taliban and prior to that

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,980
he worked for ambassador Freitag who

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,660
currently is the assistant

18
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,750
secretary-general for intelligence and

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,989
security at NATO and before that had a

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,059
history of as the vice president or

21
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,610
that's the deputy of the German

22
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,679
intelligence service and then we have

23
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,510
Leia Gabrielle she's currently the

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,430
special envoy and coordinator of the

25
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,320
global engagement Center at the State

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,060
Department and I'm really looking

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,449
forward to hearing these are your first

28
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,009
public remarks since taking the job

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,909
she's also a former Navy lieutenant

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:26,580
commander fighter pilot and human

31
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,430
intelligence officer CIA trained so

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,189
we've got three folks steeped in the

33
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,490
intelligence world here and then as Mark

34
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:38,908
says then we have mark mark galley Adi

35
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,640
is a Senior Associate Fellow at Russia

36
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,630
in London but he is also a former

37
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,049
British Foreign Office with a focus on

38
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:52,710
watching Moscow among other things so we

39
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,380
thought we'd start with a definition of

40
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,059
what is open-source intelligence and for

41
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,158
those who aren't steeped in this field

42
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,829
you may hear the folks on stage

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,360
occasionally used the word assent which

44
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,940
is an abbreviation for open-source

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:13,620
intelligence and back in 29 2010 I

46
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,890
looked up the CIA gov definition so Osen

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,750
is

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,910
drawn from publicly available material

49
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,250
including the Internet traditional mass

50
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,170
media specialized journals conference

51
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,500
proceedings and think-tank studies

52
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:29,579
photos and geospatial information like

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,290
commercial imagery products that's

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,360
changed a little bit hasn't it

55
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:38,730
who'd like to kick off bastard Freitag

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,630
thank you does this work yeah certainly

57
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:45,899
it's it's changing social media I would

58
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:49,890
add as a massive field and the Internet

59
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,630
is just ever-expanding um for my point

60
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,450
of view oesn't really means using

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,820
publicly available information any kind

62
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,280
also you know satellite information or

63
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:05,070
by intelligence officers that's what

64
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,019
makes it int n E one else mark well

65
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,180
probably the person here who's been

66
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,060
longest since they I had any kind of

67
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,760
classification I'm tempted to say that

68
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,110
OSINT is anything that I as an academic

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,970
can get at because I have absolutely no

70
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,489
or get out without having to sign a

71
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,350
piece of paper or similar the problem is

72
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,870
though that we find ourselves increasing

73
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:32,220
in a situation in which the edges of

74
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:34,410
that get blurring if I know an

75
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,340
intelligence officer and over drinks

76
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,700
this person gives me a few snippets am i

77
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,290
a freelance human intelligence case

78
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,660
officer

79
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,489
if Belling cat for example there's a

80
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:51,769
wonderful citizen intelligence and

81
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:54,090
information the resource are working off

82
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:57,000
records that should not be in the public

83
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,390
domain but are in the Deep Web is a

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,130
WikiLeaks all that exciting that I mean

85
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,899
if one looks at their investigations of

86
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,980
for example GRU Russian military

87
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,260
intelligence people they're actually

88
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,030
going after sort of car registration

89
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,310
data which shouldn't have been available

90
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,200
but is I think the problem we are now in

91
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,989
the Information Age which actually

92
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,079
information is being generated and

93
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:21,298
distributed far far more quickly than we

94
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,650
can control let alone define it and I

95
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,960
think this is why it becomes a very sort

96
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,940
of difficult topic to really nail down

97
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,430
specifically odds

98
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,870
yeah I think it also is changing a

99
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,670
little bit it gets more complex when I

100
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,410
was doing this

101
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:40,380
oesn't was a fancy word for reading

102
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,720
right but also reading the newspapers

103
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,690
reading anything that that comes on on

104
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,210
paper and pictures or videos that were

105
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,390
although open source you could get to

106
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,760
them were considered to be very very vey

107
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,820
T evidence for things you know you could

108
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,680
see that there was there there nowadays

109
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,290
and this is one of the aspects that my

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,810
organizational works on that's no longer

111
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,000
true you cannot necessarily trust a

112
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,730
picture and with the deep lake

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,540
phenomenon gaining ever more traction

114
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,280
you have doubts about videos now so I

115
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,440
think while you have more information

116
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,840
now you actually have to trouble with a

117
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,600
sophisticated way in which this

118
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,510
information is put out that goes beyond

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,520
a capability of a human being to say

120
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,310
well that sounds about good you actually

121
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,590
need and sometimes technical means to

122
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,660
tell that it's disinformation because

123
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,400
because it looks very real I just remind

124
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,470
everyone there was a very interesting

125
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,719
video of Nancy Pelosi seemingly being

126
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,190
drunk and that was totally fabricated I

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,800
mean that was actually electronically

128
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,150
produced to make a look drunk so and

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,280
this is just the beginning of what we

130
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,200
are going to see as far as deep fake is

131
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,840
concerned as far as we can see and in my

132
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,250
organization later my understanding you

133
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,060
are the only one on stage who's actually

134
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,450
CIA trained so how has it how has the

135
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,280
definition changed since you got that

136
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,140
training and did the job

137
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,049
well I'd first say that you know we used

138
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,930
to have a joke that rumor intelligence

139
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,840
room int wasn't int as well so I think I

140
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,850
I think of ascent as anything that's

141
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,469
open source that informs decision making

142
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,580
in terms of intelligence I put an int

143
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,350
buy it if it informs your

144
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,719
decision-making so it's really how you

145
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,250
use it but you know since I was a case

146
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,460
officer and since I went through that

147
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,620
training the communications age has just

148
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,789
exploded I mean the way social media has

149
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,880
developed the way the internet and the

150
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,500
way Communications has developed it's

151
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,570
completely changed the way we do work

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,070
but I think ultimately anything that can

153
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,889
inform your decision-making should be

154
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,960
used in terms of policy making to

155
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:45,930
making an docent plays a very large role

156
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,620
in that now so one of the issues that I

157
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,229
would often hear from when I would

158
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,909
interview the head of the CIA's open

159
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,909
source Center and of course it's changed

160
00:06:53,909 --> 00:07:00,120
names a few times is that they couldn't

161
00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:01,919
get the resources for they couldn't get

162
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,240
the people they wanted they couldn't get

163
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,698
the resources for the data crunching

164
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,699
they wanted to do and they felt like the

165
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,530
stepchild of the Intel community or at

166
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,620
least their part of the Intel community

167
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,179
is that changing well I think it

168
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,759
definitely is changing and I think it

169
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,469
should change you you referred to us as

170
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,789
Intel nerds and I think that you know

171
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:22,439
within the intelligence community there

172
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,818
are sort of different levels of how

173
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,349
people consider themselves or how they

174
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,509
consider the the intelligence that they

175
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,128
have human officers tend to think that

176
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,379
they're the coolest but I think that as

177
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:33,629
we see the communications age develop

178
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,659
and we see this sort of up-and-coming

179
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,949
generation of people who grew up on the

180
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,330
internet and know how to use it very

181
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,400
well and know how to use all these

182
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,710
different tools out there I think it

183
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,049
will become much more sexy I guess they

184
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,060
as you could say in the intelligence

185
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,370
world and I think you'll see more

186
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,589
resources put towards it as as people

187
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,969
come to value the different sources of

188
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:59,129
information that can be gathered openly

189
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:02,129
aren't how about at NATO how much of a

190
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:05,219
role does it play um it also plays a

191
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:07,949
role in NATO but generally I fully

192
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:10,110
concur with what you just said I think

193
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:12,120
it's a real culture change that's that

194
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,860
that's happening in the intelligence

195
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,819
community of many Intel officers that I

196
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,830
have spoken to have been originally

197
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:25,770
skeptical but it doesn't have the same

198
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:29,310
kind of value or professionality you

199
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,519
know or as cool as humans and so on and

200
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,110
that's appreciation is definitely

201
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,849
changing it doesn't have classified

202
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,430
stamped on the top of it so it is

203
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,800
important absolutely but of course I

204
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,390
mean the what I try to say in the

205
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,760
beginning is the combination of using

206
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:48,000
publicly available information with in

207
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,980
you know the use of of intelligence

208
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,860
officers so they apply their that

209
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,949
tradecraft their processes their

210
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,709
contextual knowledge

211
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:59,349
to it so that that's really why it's

212
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:02,439
called not just open source but but

213
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:06,249
intelligence that I think generally um

214
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:11,290
it is still a child's less so and in the

215
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:13,259
US and then in most other services I

216
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,790
think because you are moving ahead

217
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:18,309
spearheading the development to some

218
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,379
extent most services in Europe are not

219
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:24,429
really at that stage yet but this is

220
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:28,239
definitely the trend I see including at

221
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:31,238
nature so so we use it of course on the

222
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:33,910
level of the individual and analyst but

223
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:37,629
but but there's also a nose in policy

224
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:42,189
that that we have and there are specific

225
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:45,009
sources and search engines that's that

226
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:47,199
we use at NATO so search engines that

227
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,939
help you find open source information

228
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:53,139
related to whatever subject you're

229
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:56,079
looking at Hans I just wrote an article

230
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:58,660
in time about child soldiers who fought

231
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:02,498
for Isis how would you have used an

232
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:05,829
article like that in your old job well

233
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:07,749
in my old job for the UN we actually

234
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:09,819
relied a lot on open source intelligence

235
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:11,919
especially since the rise of ISIL

236
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:15,189
because for the longest time at least

237
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:17,499
until 2015 ISIL did everyone a favor by

238
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:19,660
in a very organized manner so it was

239
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:21,639
definitely controlled by the media

240
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,919
Department but put out a lot of

241
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:25,899
information of where people are what was

242
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,350
happening what crimes were committed for

243
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:31,959
propaganda purposes so it played a very

244
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,610
significant role at the rise of ISIL

245
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:37,209
this is things like when they put out

246
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,799
videos of beheadings and and significant

247
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,238
military engagements or where you could

248
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,850
actually with a little bit of knowledge

249
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:44,949
of Iraq and Syria somehow figure out

250
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,639
where this potentially would have been

251
00:10:44,949 --> 00:10:51,279
but as the organization became under

252
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,730
pressure that material became less and

253
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,139
less useful because they learned that

254
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,839
women weren't the only ones looking at

255
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:01,419
were this military engagement was and

256
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,069
where they may be next so they they got

257
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:06,369
smarter but if it played a very

258
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:07,510
significant role nevertheless I do think

259
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:09,310
that there is a

260
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,370
a certain lesson that needs to be drawn

261
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,130
and my my organization argues very much

262
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,340
for that is that we had massive global

263
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:21,160
corporations being misused in an

264
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,820
exaggerated manner by a global terrorist

265
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,140
organization to recruit to finance to

266
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,570
organize themselves to communicate

267
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,120
during attacks including communicate

268
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:33,430
during Europe with very little from from

269
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,530
platform providers was done against that

270
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,510
for for about two years they they seem

271
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:40,569
to be catching on to the fact that this

272
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,920
is a problem but as Christchurch has

273
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,750
demonstrated they catching on on the

274
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,089
al-qaeda ISIL side and they just missed

275
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,190
that you know right-wing people are

276
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,410
perfectly happy to kill people as well

277
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,560
so there is a problem of lack of

278
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,170
regulation in that space and and would

279
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,530
be violent to actors or violent actors

280
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:05,469
are moving to the dark web where is that

281
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,329
is that open source anymore if it you

282
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,640
know if it requires a password to get

283
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:13,000
onto a site or if it's a channel that's

284
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,630
invite-only what it's open source as far

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,310
as you can access it right so i would

286
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,350
define in tell us something that states

287
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,760
sanctions for you to do something

288
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,330
illegal in another state to obtain

289
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,100
information right and and I I have heard

290
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:32,410
from some other intelligence officers

291
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:34,150
that they've taken XYZ reporter when it

292
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,600
interviewed and bedded with the Taliban

293
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,400
and for them that article was gold

294
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,160
because it gave them raw intelligence

295
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,189
that they couldn't a raw data that they

296
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,949
couldn't get otherwise yeah but I would

297
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,170
caution anyone who thinks that you know

298
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,670
intelligence services are super eager to

299
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,319
talk to journalists because that is very

300
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,610
dangerous for the journalist oh no I

301
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,470
didn't mean to talk to the journalists I

302
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:01,240
meant read whatever is openly available

303
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:03,580
and and as I said I mean Oseland is a

304
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,250
very fancy term but it's not a new

305
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,470
concept it's not something that started

306
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,540
the last five or six years or with the

307
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,520
advent of ISIL it's something that was

308
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,880
always there it was considered to be a

309
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,819
less fancy part of of what the

310
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,529
organization did but at least in our

311
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,329
country all source intelligence in one

312
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:25,879
service was always the philosophy and

313
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:30,589
that always also included an element of

314
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:32,480
open source I just like to add that you

315
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,889
know again I go back to saying that you

316
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,720
can use intelligence as anything that's

317
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:38,749
really informing an intelligence agency

318
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,749
or informing decision making but I think

319
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:42,980
where intelligence agencies and

320
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:44,870
professional government lead

321
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,180
intelligence organizations really come

322
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,879
into play and what differentiates them

323
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,459
is the ability to vet information so

324
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,329
when you're talking about for example

325
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:55,489
journalists conducting an interview

326
00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:57,258
that's helpful that would be considered

327
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,899
a single source as a human intelligence

328
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:03,019
officer if I got information from one

329
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,790
source that wouldn't be a decision

330
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:07,069
wouldn't be made based on one source

331
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,170
intelligence that would be one data

332
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:11,569
point that I would then look to connect

333
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,849
to other data points or an analyst would

334
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:15,469
look to connect other data points to

335
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,269
essentially verify whether or not this

336
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,139
information is true so betting is

337
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:20,269
something that intelligence

338
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,860
organizations do extremely well that I

339
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:24,370
think is a bit of more of a challenge

340
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,209
for open source intelligence

341
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,920
organizations that don't quite have all

342
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:29,479
of the tools that a government would

343
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,180
have so an article might highlight

344
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,439
something that oh we gotta go look at

345
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,628
this and then you go use your other

346
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,920
tools to study it absolutely I mean as

347
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:38,059
an intelligence officer as a human

348
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,009
intelligence officer in terms of

349
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:41,389
targeting if I was going to meet

350
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:42,889
somebody and I wanted to know about them

351
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:44,540
I might look at a social media account

352
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:46,670
but if you look at my social media

353
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,959
accounts there might be times when you

354
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,209
think I'm in Aruba but that's actually

355
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:51,439
me posting after the fact so how good is

356
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:53,479
that intelligence if it's just one

357
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:55,160
source now if you were to look at my

358
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,660
Instagram page and see that I was in

359
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,490
Aruba and then verify that with another

360
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,050
source who saw me there now you're onto

361
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,129
something right so I think it's it's a

362
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,660
matter of a vetting that's very

363
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:07,250
important yes I mean I would very much

364
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,719
agree as well with that question of

365
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,459
having to triangulate through through

366
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,980
multiple sources and I think this is one

367
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,239
of the interesting advantages of open

368
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,040
source as well as the challenge is

369
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,639
precisely because it actually provides a

370
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,740
whole range of alternative ways of of

371
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,600
getting nowhere you know human

372
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,389
intelligence case officers they have

373
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,699
their array of existing sources and so

374
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:30,679
forth technical intelligence have their

375
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:32,540
particular exploits and so forth Oh

376
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:35,209
Osen can be anything from precisely

377
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:38,839
social media to newspaper account

378
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:40,459
to whatever but what this doesn't sort

379
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,240
of necessary directors towards and I

380
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,329
think is one of the kind of crucial

381
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,889
points is what is it good for and what

382
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:47,839
is it not good for I mean I think

383
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:49,670
there's an increasing sort of Orthodoxy

384
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,429
nowadays that well Osen can basically

385
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,319
tell you almost anything and the answer

386
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:55,879
is actually it can even if I think back

387
00:15:54,319 --> 00:16:01,639
to my own time when I was consuming

388
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:04,069
classified materials if I'm honest 90 to

389
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:07,009
95 percent of the time it did not change

390
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:09,349
my perspective it was often great

391
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,749
because I you know my my gut had told me

392
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,730
X was the case and now I had material so

393
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:15,790
I think yes I feel more comfortable with

394
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,829
that but it very rarely actually

395
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,290
revolutionized my perspective but then

396
00:16:18,829 --> 00:16:23,420
there was the five to ten percent of

397
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:25,160
times when something came in through

398
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:29,509
these are alternative routes which

399
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:32,269
absolutely did shift me 90 degrees 180

400
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:34,459
degrees and in some ways I think this is

401
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:38,779
this is one of the difficulties we have

402
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:40,729
OSINT can do almost anything and what we

403
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:43,519
need to be much much sharper about is

404
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:45,730
what can't it do and what therefore is

405
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,629
actually the realm for everything else

406
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:51,829
now something that plays into this is

407
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:57,980
fake news

408
00:16:51,829 --> 00:17:01,459
how does fake news make trusting what

409
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,439
you see analytically harder I mean how

410
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:08,569
does it complicate intelligence in

411
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:10,819
general well I mean if you look at other

412
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:14,148
other sources of intelligence I mean not

413
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,829
only become the collector and the annals

414
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:18,770
of intelligence may be affected by the

415
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:20,809
fakeness but the source may be he may he

416
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:22,220
or she may actually believe something to

417
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,990
be the case that is not the case so as I

418
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,270
said at the very beginning it's getting

419
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,760
more sophisticated on how misinformation

420
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,460
is put out and that effects everyone but

421
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,860
I think we we getting a little bit away

422
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,230
from the issue when we are saying what

423
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,600
can horse into I I also believe that or

424
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,250
send human human intelligence again

425
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,620
signal intelligence or telephone calls

426
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,230
and anything on electronic or image

427
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,539
intelligence each one of them has their

428
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,770
role to play and it's the the vetting in

429
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:50,660
the analysis part

430
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:53,450
that makes it into intelligence which is

431
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:56,180
very different from a good investigative

432
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,270
report or a journalistic report that may

433
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:01,190
very well tell me what happened but my

434
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,080
job is not to tell the government what

435
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,880
happened or it is also to tell the

436
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,280
government what happen my job is to say

437
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,130
and now this is what's most likely to

438
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,680
happen and that is the intelligence part

439
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,120
of it that you always have to the

440
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,160
intelligence analysis part of it you

441
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,320
always have to look to the future so

442
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,600
it's of course important to understand

443
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,490
the present but the whole point of the

444
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,290
exercise is not to explain what happened

445
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,780
yesterday but what will happen next

446
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:29,060
Monday so so crowd-sourced intelligence

447
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,610
like Belen cat can help us understand

448
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,310
what happened with the shoot-down of the

449
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:37,850
airliner over Ukraine but it can't tell

450
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:43,159
us what what Russian intelligence is

451
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:46,399
planning to do next yeah mark asked the

452
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,220
questions what can also not do I think

453
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,680
what is the hardest part is to

454
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,780
understand what key leaders think what

455
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,000
their intents are but then intentions

456
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,710
are I mean it's the hardest part for

457
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,800
almost any any intelligence but but

458
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,410
definitely for for hos and for that so

459
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,710
of course humans and and second some of

460
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:08,120
the traditional and intelligence so for

461
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:11,810
those you know human intelligence

462
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,209
collection is someone sitting down with

463
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:17,540
a contact perhaps source in a foreign

464
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,010
government they may have paid them for

465
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,200
that intelligence and they develop a

466
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,570
client relationship with them and then

467
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,990
SIGINT is what the National Security

468
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:29,870
Agency or GCHQ do it's it's grabbing the

469
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,700
electric electronic signals wherever

470
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,050
they can find them actual phone

471
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:37,910
recordings tapping people's phone calls

472
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:40,070
decoding a whatsapp message etc thank

473
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,600
you for that sorry absurdity is the

474
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,060
right answer so listening to real

475
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,550
conversations for instance so this is a

476
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,649
limitation of Odin but but really the

477
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,780
the answer is as all of you have been

478
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:54,500
saying not to just have one data points

479
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,510
but to have as many different types of

480
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,020
as possible from different forms of

481
00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,910
intelligence and do all sorts and and

482
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,540
the question of what can ascend do for

483
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,280
us I think

484
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,899
really applicable to the work that I'm

485
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,610
doing the global engagement Center so

486
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:10,070
for those of you who don't know at the

487
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,929
global engagement Center direct leads

488
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,669
synchronized and synchronizes and

489
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,500
coordinates efforts of the US government

490
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:18,440
to counter propaganda and disinformation

491
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,150
from state and non-state actors we work

492
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,510
with international partners we work with

493
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,490
NGOs the private sector basically across

494
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,600
the board the international community of

495
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:29,540
countering propaganda and disinformation

496
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,360
is basically who we seek to be

497
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,430
energizing that network with and helping

498
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,070
to counter propagandist information so a

499
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:40,160
good example of how Osen is very helpful

500
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,810
for us is that if we were to detect a

501
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,150
disinformation campaign and one of our

502
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,070
partner countries well we would want to

503
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,210
inform them of that that they could do

504
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,070
their own work to counter that

505
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,110
disinformation but they would want to

506
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:53,090
see evidence so if we were to use our

507
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,129
traditional intelligence sources if we

508
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:57,199
were to use SIGINT it would take a long

509
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,910
time to try to declassify that if we

510
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,000
even could declassify it to then share

511
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,890
with our partner countries with OSINT

512
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,810
much of its going to be for the most

513
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,980
part is gonna be unclassified so we can

514
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,260
use this you know commercial

515
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,760
off-the-shelf technology or companies or

516
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,379
NGOs that have discovered a

517
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,420
disinformation campaign and then share

518
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,130
that with partner nations while they saw

519
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,610
the time to act on it and then to

520
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:21,980
counter propaganda or disinformation but

521
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:25,419
then the problem is that because it's

522
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,850
open adversary's will learn from it

523
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:31,160
other than clandestine intelligence

524
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:35,020
which is only captain and governments

525
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:39,530
circle so there are examples like

526
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:41,600
tracking movements of soldiers by their

527
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,180
social media communications with with

528
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,459
their family so and now what we see is

529
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:50,120
is that the Russian Armed Forces banned

530
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:53,960
the use of mobile phones but of course

531
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,189
what they couldn't ban was the from my

532
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,100
understanding there are a lot of car

533
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:01,610
accidents in Russia and so because of

534
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,620
that people have cameras in their

535
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,320
dashboards that are running all the time

536
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,360
to capture what actually happened and

537
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,320
because of that there are a lot of

538
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:15,659
pictures that got posted to the web of

539
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:18,570
Tanks going into Crimea from Russia

540
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:24,440
Russia couldn't do anything about that

541
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:28,679
so I another aspect of this though is

542
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:32,700
the scribble attack the attack on the

543
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:35,820
former US former Russian spy in Britain

544
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,390
I as a reporter trying to track that

545
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:42,149
down was basically stuck between the

546
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:44,670
u.s. and the UK telling us you know

547
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:46,680
here's what we believe happened and we'd

548
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:48,990
ask for proof and they would say we just

549
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,630
got it you can't can't show you the same

550
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:55,320
thing when we were reporting on moves

551
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:57,480
with Iran and what happened with an

552
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,770
alleged Iranian attack through a proxy

553
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:06,450
on a tanker in the Gulf show us sorry we

554
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:09,480
can't and for us it means and then back

555
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:13,230
to the scribble example then Russian

556
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,020
officials and Russian media put out 9 or

557
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:19,860
10 different versions of what actually

558
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:22,320
likely happened and for the reporter

559
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,580
then it's almost like is it this a test

560
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:30,179
of patriotism is it a test of it who who

561
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:33,330
is telling me the thing I can believe so

562
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,310
that that's my frustration when you all

563
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,310
in the Intel world say take it on faith

564
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:41,669
and I can't find something in the open

565
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:43,620
source world to back it up I think it's

566
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,240
really important to work together and to

567
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,100
come up with ways that you can share

568
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,840
information as best as possible but I

569
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,429
think what I would say on that is that

570
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,949
you as a journalist and me as a former

571
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,230
journalist we are sources of information

572
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,690
for adversaries for for countries that

573
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,950
would do us harm and so that's why from

574
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:00,540
the intelligence community we have to be

575
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,090
so careful with what we share because as

576
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,639
you are saying you can inform those who

577
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,649
would do harm through journalism or

578
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,440
through Osen but then that leaves you

579
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:12,210
open to the situation where the public

580
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,310
might believe one of those 9 or 10

581
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:17,460
different alternative versions because

582
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:19,169
it Cleaves with their view of the world

583
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,030
and that is one of the trickiest parts

584
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,890
of the work that I do at the global

585
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,660
engagement Center and that's why we

586
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:26,700
believe that building resiliency in

587
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,960
populations is so key and what I mean

588
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,279
when I say billion bill

589
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,049
resiliency is is basically developing

590
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,629
developing sort of a in the back of your

591
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,220
head thought process that's skeptical

592
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:40,559
when you look at information when we go

593
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,210
online we should all be thinking what's

594
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,950
the source of this information and can I

595
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,980
trust it and it kind of goes back to

596
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:49,619
journalism as well when I first got into

597
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,450
journalism in 2009 the big thing was

598
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,740
citizen journalists everyone's a

599
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,090
journalist now because everyone has a

600
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:56,279
phone and this was actually kind of

601
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,869
scary to people who were professional

602
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:59,879
journalists because are we gonna lose

603
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:01,709
our careers to to anybody who has an

604
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:04,139
iPhone but I think what we all quickly

605
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,879
learned is how well vetted is that

606
00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:07,709
person how well vetted is that source

607
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:10,019
and can you trust them as a reporter or

608
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,759
might they be doing something funny

609
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:13,740
online and just want to trick you with a

610
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,360
story that's not even true so I think we

611
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,610
have to apply that across the board now

612
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,350
and be skeptical at as we look at

613
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,289
information and make sure that we're

614
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,149
taking a look at sources and developing

615
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:26,220
sources that we trust by the way I'm

616
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:29,639
gonna be switching to questions

617
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:32,100
shortly and we don't have the slide Oh

618
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:34,019
app so you're gonna have to raise hands

619
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,029
the old-fashioned way but mark you had

620
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:37,440
some yeah I mean particularly when one

621
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:39,720
looks at the screen pile case I mean it

622
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,649
was problematic and I think in in both

623
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,340
the case of the UK and US government's I

624
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:47,070
personally might think they were a

625
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,480
little bit too conservative because what

626
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,610
we were to realize and this also fits

627
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,100
into the whole kind of disruptive ethos

628
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,269
of this whole conference is actually the

629
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,498
center which we are currently going

630
00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:58,499
through a period of a generalised

631
00:25:55,499 --> 00:25:59,639
legitimacy crisis and so many of the

632
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:02,369
other issues it's because you know there

633
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:04,740
are populations who have come to regard

634
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:07,799
with skepticism what sort of standard no

635
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,570
very concept that term mainstream media

636
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,480
which I can't stand but it somehow

637
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:14,100
implies well it's their media it's kind

638
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,389
of outside they don't believe they're

639
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,959
politicians and so forth and therefore

640
00:26:15,389 --> 00:26:20,998
they are precisely vulnerable to

641
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,100
disinformation and such like but I would

642
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:26,159
actually want to bring out the dutch

643
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:29,549
response to the OPCW hack which for me

644
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,679
was an absolute master class in how you

645
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:33,119
do handle these cases when they caught

646
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,769
rush and spread I was gonna say for the

647
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:37,289
audience can you explain I mean they

648
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:39,570
they they caught some some Russian GRU

649
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:41,560
officers who are technical intelligence

650
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,020
people who are you know in

651
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,330
car park of the neighboring hotel trying

652
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,360
to break into the systems of the OPCW

653
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:52,090
the the anti chemical weapons watchdog

654
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,399
precisely to see what what the OPCW had

655
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,530
and I mean the the Dutch when they did

656
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,360
release it they were incredibly open

657
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,270
they released a lot of information they

658
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,570
basically they treated the the audience

659
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,700
as adults they used a certain amount of

660
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,429
humor which is always a good weapon to

661
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,930
use but the main thing is they did not

662
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,360
just simply assume they did not just

663
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,920
simply say here are some oldish men in

664
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,959
suits and they will tell you how it

665
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,150
really was they will realize that

666
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,400
doesn't work anymore and they instead

667
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,710
have to say you may be skeptical you may

668
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,870
have already heard 50 different sort of

669
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,730
theories about what goes on we're gonna

670
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:29,679
show you actually how it really was and

671
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,930
that is effectively I think this is this

672
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:33,400
is the other I think value of

673
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:35,470
open-source is because absolutely

674
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,220
everyone everyone gets to try to define

675
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,120
it but in fact if we genuinely do have

676
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,430
truth on our side

677
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,250
however naive it may be saying you say

678
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,710
that we already have a very powerful

679
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:51,220
force multiplier for how we use open

680
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:53,470
source also as a means of influencing

681
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,450
opinion I'm gonna throw the wrench in

682
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:58,600
there though of with deep fakes coming

683
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:01,330
online the ability to alter videos so

684
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,340
that it can't you can't tell that it was

685
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,689
anything but what it's being presented

686
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:08,860
as no but all that means is precisely

687
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,090
therefore we need to be all the more

688
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,240
seduced it won't just think we'd be

689
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:16,510
saying well here is for example as Ben

690
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:20,500
screech out here our footage from the

691
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:22,840
airport of the two suspected want to

692
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,520
want to be assassins coming in you're

693
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,100
actually precisely you'll have to treat

694
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,540
the public like analysts who X

695
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,189
themselves will be looking to

696
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,470
triangulate who themselves will be

697
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,180
saying well one source we don't trust

698
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,120
so you're saying fine here are 10

699
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:39,490
sources did they reveal through that

700
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,770
aren't it sounds like you were familiar

701
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,600
with what the Dutch did with this did

702
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:47,170
they reveal anything ultimately that

703
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,550
damaged their source and sources methods

704
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:52,840
collection I don't think so I also agree

705
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:55,000
and I wanted to bring up the same

706
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,220
example because it's it's the finest

707
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,180
and I know incredibly well researched

708
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:05,560
actually Dutch and British collaboration

709
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:08,200
and it was full of details and and and

710
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,929
evidence I think they they made very

711
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,180
clear that they didn't reveal and any

712
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:16,180
information that would damage their bad

713
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:19,270
tradecraft that that was the the bulk of

714
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:21,220
the work is to distinguish those two but

715
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,800
it was the most convincing example truly

716
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,920
to the general public that that I know

717
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:30,419
and for instance and in Germany I've

718
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:35,560
heard a lot of skepticism when I talk to

719
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:37,270
the public about is hybrid warfare as

720
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,490
that really exists and so and so on and

721
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,610
and this example was was was the one

722
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:45,910
that got so much traction now you're in

723
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:47,979
a position at NATO where you're taking

724
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,140
intelligence streams from a number of

725
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,120
different nations and I know that there

726
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,680
are always issues with intelligence

727
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,780
sharing you know the Americans don't

728
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:00,000
want to share with X country because

729
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:04,060
they're too friendly with Moscow etc

730
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,340
what about this makes your job harder

731
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,169
and is open-source intelligence one of

732
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,929
the few things that you have no problem

733
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:16,360
sharing well it's it's a continuous

734
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:20,380
challenge for us of course how much does

735
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:22,389
a nation want to share at 29 nations

736
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:25,510
there's always a there's a risk and

737
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:30,640
there's again adjourned and and in every

738
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:34,540
instance the donating nation makes a

739
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:39,400
cost-benefit analysis if you like taking

740
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:43,710
the example of cripple the Brits came to

741
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:47,020
us at a very early stage and and shared

742
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:50,710
more than then they shared with with the

743
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:53,050
public because the ultimately

744
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:56,860
intelligence sharing as a purpose it's

745
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:58,870
it's not just for the sake of sharing or

746
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,469
fulfilling a duty but but you want to

747
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:04,780
you know to drive a decision and and

748
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:07,920
have a constant provoke a consequence

749
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:11,040
that NATO in this case it was very clear

750
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:16,490
that's the the consequence would be or

751
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:19,350
could be to expel intelligence

752
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:22,140
professionals under the guise of of

753
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:26,399
diplomats in fact we were able within a

754
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:29,040
few days to to expel about 150 from from

755
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:32,070
NATO countries so that was a direct

756
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:35,399
consequence of this hunts when you were

757
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:39,689
in your UN position how much difficulty

758
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,100
did you have getting access to member

759
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,010
nation's intelligence that you needed

760
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,980
for your job surprisingly

761
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:48,660
much less than than we thought we had I

762
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,850
mean first of all this team that I was

763
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,380
leading doesn't exist only since

764
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:55,740
yesterday it has a track record of the

765
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:59,130
last 15 years of being a trusted partner

766
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:01,170
with many nations obviously also the UN

767
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,510
Security Council level when it's about

768
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,190
building a global sanctions regime is a

769
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,650
fairly strategic level so you never

770
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,350
really have to ask for extremely

771
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:12,960
detailed operational information except

772
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:15,199
on individuals that are already publicly

773
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,140
sanctioned by the Security Council ie

774
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,180
unlikely to be a target of a targeted

775
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,340
intelligence operation by one member

776
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:26,070
state because the names already on a the

777
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:28,139
loudest most public sanctions list that

778
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,899
there is on the club so it worked quite

779
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,540
well but it is and I just wanted to do

780
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,610
one little footnote on how easy is we've

781
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:39,090
all seen to share intelligence sharing

782
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:41,280
is not a question necessarily of what

783
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:45,510
source the intelligence had before you

784
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,820
got into your system that doesn't really

785
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:50,129
make it much easier or harder to get it

786
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,399
out of your system it is a question of

787
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:55,350
trust between two partners if you have a

788
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,300
high level of trust you can share much

789
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,399
more if you have a low level of trust

790
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,320
you will share next to nothing and that

791
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,720
would include open source intelligence

792
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,879
because in an analysis it will not just

793
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,100
be open source intelligence it will have

794
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,470
also included other intelligence so just

795
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,770
because it comes from the internet or

796
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:16,680
newspaper into the process the out card

797
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:18,120
the outgoing product is not exactly much

798
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,730
easier to share if it's ninety percent

799
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,539
was and if you do not trust the other

800
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:24,929
service on the earth

801
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:27,509
side and I think sometimes just to add

802
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:29,129
to that it's not just a matter of how

803
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:31,470
well you trust each other as countries

804
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:33,869
it's also how well you trust the

805
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,429
information infrastructure that a

806
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:36,988
partner country is using because

807
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:38,580
sometimes you might very much trust a

808
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:40,409
country but if they're using an

809
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,478
information infrastructure that's not

810
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:43,649
trustworthy or that's easy penetrate

811
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:46,739
able then you're going to be less likely

812
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:49,320
to share information you mean like

813
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:52,529
perhaps if they have some Russian or

814
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,939
Chinese software or hardware as part of

815
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:55,799
theirs intrinsic as part of their system

816
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:01,200
feel free to talk about Huawei if you

817
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:03,769
like your words yeah well you're

818
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,029
referring to you know the issues of

819
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:08,520
infrastructure and information sharing

820
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:10,290
and I think that anytime that you want

821
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,899
to share with anyone and this applies

822
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:14,129
just across the board you're you want to

823
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:16,500
know if you're gonna trust them with a

824
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:18,509
secret whether or not you can trust that

825
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,549
person but also whether or not you can

826
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,990
trust where they might store that secret

827
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:24,119
or they wear that how that might be

828
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:26,040
transmitted so that is always going to

829
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,010
come into play beyond just the trust of

830
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,259
the relationships but Osen I think is

831
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:33,780
extremely useful because going back to

832
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,309
what I've said before it's not

833
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,000
necessarily the information you have

834
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:38,700
today

835
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,960
that's so sensitive it's sensitive

836
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,509
information that you're sharing if it's

837
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,490
intelligence but it's it's the sources

838
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,710
and the methodology by which you

839
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:48,658
collected it because if that information

840
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,129
is compromised it makes it much more

841
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,589
difficult to do the work in the future

842
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:55,949
and makes you much more vulnerable to

843
00:34:52,589 --> 00:34:59,009
attacks by the adversary one of the

844
00:34:55,949 --> 00:35:01,140
things that has made the journalism job

845
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:04,859
harder and I don't know if your time at

846
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:07,710
Fox if you experienced this as well the

847
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:10,549
proliferation of social media means when

848
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:13,770
someone goes out there with a report a

849
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:17,160
citizen journalists report or a picture

850
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:19,109
of an explosion in X location and and we

851
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,540
check the geolocation and it does look

852
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:23,250
like it's you know in the center of

853
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,859
Baghdad and it does look like it's a

854
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,200
massive explosion outside the US Embassy

855
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:31,259
or something like that there is the

856
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:34,899
pressure on us to confirm confirm

857
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,250
confirm and also the pressure like

858
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,960
you've got the picture so if you just

859
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,319
get one source that's enough whereas

860
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,920
usually your editor would want two or

861
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:46,630
three sources before you'd go out on air

862
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,799
how does that change in the Intel world

863
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:52,510
I'm just is there a similar effect well

864
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:54,220
I think it comes back to in the Intel

865
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,809
world you always want to be able to vet

866
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,578
your sources and you want to be able to

867
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:59,829
have multiple sources to make a decision

868
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:01,990
with before you assess it to be actually

869
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:03,640
true information I certainly you know

870
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:07,359
had the experience that you did where in

871
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,000
news the ratings increase if you are the

872
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,440
first one to come to air with some sort

873
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,420
of a major situation that's happened but

874
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,220
we've seen situations in the past were

875
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,390
major news organizations have reported

876
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,250
something that might have been actually

877
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,288
a military exercise but thought it was a

878
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,789
major incident happening in Washington

879
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:23,770
and they wanted to be the first to

880
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:25,839
report and made the mistake by going

881
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,099
going to air saying it was an incident

882
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:28,869
when actually it was just something that

883
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,430
was an exercise whereas other news

884
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:31,630
organizations were more careful to vet

885
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:34,419
the information I think that's always

886
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:36,069
true in terms of information and it's

887
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,650
certainly true in terms of intelligence

888
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:40,900
so I would say in principle it's not

889
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:44,140
that different in intelligence also

890
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:48,089
there the more the more confirmations

891
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:53,020
from other sources you have the better

892
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:56,049
your outcome is there the better you can

893
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:57,970
inform a decision makers but of course

894
00:36:56,049 --> 00:37:01,059
there's there's a tangent if you see

895
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:04,868
some something very important with on a

896
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:08,319
single source you you cannot always wait

897
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:11,079
before for days or weeks because you

898
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:13,660
know that you know that political

899
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,599
iterations make decisions at an early

900
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:21,160
stage and and then you also have this

901
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:23,619
effect of hybrids blurring and that we

902
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,319
we've seen that many times with with

903
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:32,049
Russia and probably other luring yeah so

904
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:35,829
um if the the example of scraper was was

905
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:40,288
mentioned and they were almost ten

906
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:43,750
narratives that Russia put out that

907
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:47,319
confused Western audiences I know many

908
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:48,400
such examples so it is actually

909
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:50,650
important too to come

910
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,279
out weather with a clear decision or

911
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:55,599
statement at an early stage but then you

912
00:37:54,279 --> 00:37:57,009
don't really want to do that with with

913
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,069
only a single source so you have that

914
00:37:57,009 --> 00:38:02,740
tension in much the same way that you

915
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:04,720
have internally you can put high medium

916
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,999
and low confidence but you can only go

917
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,769
to the public with high confidence yeah

918
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,450
but also I mean it has an effect in a

919
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:13,689
different way is that intelligence

920
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:16,419
gathering and analysis is not a service

921
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:19,180
in itself it serves decision making and

922
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,269
so you do get much more pressure from

923
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,710
decision makers I mean even in my

924
00:38:21,269 --> 00:38:26,649
position at the UN let alone in the

925
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:29,019
government who won quicker information

926
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,749
in analysis of what this means and what

927
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:34,749
goes on and so you you are a little bit

928
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:37,689
more driven because your decision makers

929
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:39,368
that you work for have already or are in

930
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,710
the process of forming an opinion and

931
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:43,059
that puts more time pressure on you

932
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,559
cannot say I come back to you in two

933
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:46,749
weeks when I have verified this with

934
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,150
five different sources I have to say one

935
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:51,819
one situation where I was involved as a

936
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:55,150
reporter I was at the AP when the attack

937
00:38:51,819 --> 00:39:01,779
happened on the US outpost in Benghazi

938
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:05,559
and of course I talked to the CIA that

939
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:09,970
day as as the news was breaking and from

940
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:12,400
the beginning we were being told by we

941
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,769
were allowed to say you know US

942
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,190
intelligence officials or CIA officials

943
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:20,919
believed that there was some sort of

944
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:23,980
riot at the scene and separately from

945
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,989
that so that that was in my report the

946
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:29,160
other thing that came from the AP person

947
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:31,660
who was on the ground she interviewed

948
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,038
both the writer and then the fixer who

949
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,700
was on the scene interviewed some

950
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:41,289
Libyans who had seen on social media

951
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:44,259
come to the US consulate I there's gonna

952
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:47,140
be a demonstration against this

953
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:52,349
anti-islamic film and so some people

954
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:56,170
came they told the AP reporter and fixer

955
00:39:52,349 --> 00:40:00,369
they came with signs to protest and also

956
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:01,720
saw guys with guns and RPGs etc and said

957
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:05,620
wow this is not what we signed

958
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,480
for so I later talked to both the House

959
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,400
Intelligence Committee and other US

960
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,290
intelligence officers who said look when

961
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,210
we were giving our assessment to top

962
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:16,180
Obama administration officials we were

963
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:18,760
relying on some of your reports and that

964
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:20,710
and I later talked to a group of US

965
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,920
military officers who'd also tracked

966
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:26,140
that stuff happening on social media

967
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,160
that the militants seemed to be trying

968
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:34,000
to create an event that would draw a

969
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:38,560
crowd that they could hide in so I kind

970
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,870
of felt responsible later in that the

971
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,410
Obama administration just first went out

972
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:47,140
and made some comments saying that this

973
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:49,420
all started as a demonstration and then

974
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:51,310
we're accused of covering things up so I

975
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,620
don't know what what your take was on

976
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:56,230
that on that at the time or if you were

977
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,900
in active duty somewhere in the Navy I

978
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:04,830
was actually a reporter for NBC News in

979
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:07,120
San Diego at the time but I go back to I

980
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,799
guess really thinking in terms of you

981
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,220
know you hear about the fog of war and

982
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,980
being a reporter there's also the fog of

983
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,149
breaking news where in my experience is

984
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,940
journalists you have to be extremely

985
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:21,040
careful because the facts are changing

986
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:22,750
as time goes on and we've seen this

987
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,730
again and again pretty much every major

988
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:27,400
breaking news situation some of the

989
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,500
early reporting is oftentimes not true

990
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,760
and it's because people are trying to

991
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,780
get information out as quickly as

992
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,150
possible

993
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,410
there there's reporting what they see on

994
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,170
the ground and what they're hearing from

995
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,750
sources and then that picture is built

996
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:43,750
over time they're seeing straws and

997
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,270
exactly they're seeing points data

998
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:48,430
points right sources on the ground but

999
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:50,350
somebody might see something and believe

1000
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,520
it to be one thing when from a different

1001
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,200
perspective it's it's completely

1002
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,060
different so I think that that's sort of

1003
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,830
a natural thing that happens and any

1004
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,299
sort of a breaking news situation is

1005
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,759
that there is somewhat of a fog

1006
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,010
initially that eventually a picture is

1007
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,530
built over time it's one of the things I

1008
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:08,550
was told about Benghazi was that the

1009
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:15,100
contractor who wrote the book 13 hours

1010
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:15,640
was a US congressman Declassified this

1011
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,380
and

1012
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,790
I reported it at the AP and like the

1013
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,160
report went nowhere which was really

1014
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:24,430
frustrating because the CIA allowed him

1015
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,529
to say this to me that when US forces

1016
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:30,069
had pulled out after the NATO operation

1017
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:31,870
in Libya a classified memo went out at

1018
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:35,650
the highest levels but only two CIA

1019
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:38,440
staffers so the gentleman the CIA

1020
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:41,050
staffer security officer in charge of

1021
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,640
security in Benghazi at the CIA base

1022
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,530
which is was of course separate from the

1023
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,170
US diplomatic base knew that if there

1024
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:49,870
was intact there would be no rescue but

1025
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:52,000
the contractors weren't read in on that

1026
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:53,620
so they were operating on two different

1027
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,290
sets of information and those things

1028
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:58,750
have played out in the media as has

1029
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:04,300
become a huge political battle that

1030
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:07,120
arguably damaged Hillary Clinton's

1031
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:11,100
presidential campaign and I know it

1032
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:14,830
certainly hurt the political standing of

1033
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:17,110
former House Intelligence Chairman Mike

1034
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,790
Rogers who was a Republican put out the

1035
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:24,430
report with all of this in it publicly

1036
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:26,890
and then got hammered for it so question

1037
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:30,759
right here and could you identify

1038
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:36,150
yourself and do we have do what do we

1039
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,150
have any microphones question right here

1040
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:41,410
and to the audience please always make

1041
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,240
sure there's a question in your question

1042
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:46,149
thank you very much Mario Nicolini

1043
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:49,990
Slovak value-for-money unit in Ministry

1044
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:55,090
of Finance this time thank you very much

1045
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:57,279
for this exposition of the current

1046
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:59,680
trends and in this very important area

1047
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,980
which makes me think of other functions

1048
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,810
of government which do a lot of the same

1049
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,820
things that the intelligence community

1050
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,970
does meaning dealing with a lot of

1051
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:16,120
information collating analyzing in order

1052
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:18,490
to then shaping or helping make a good

1053
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:21,759
policy decision have there are we you

1054
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:24,479
aware in any of these nations that you

1055
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,760
work for or with

1056
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:34,770
of maybe attempts to sort of share or

1057
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,050
demand the know-how of intelligence to

1058
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:39,380
support other functions that do

1059
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:42,380
particularly open-source and maybe the

1060
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:46,890
also the shady whatever we can access

1061
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:51,330
intelligence functions that you have big

1062
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:53,779
data analysis is there anything or is

1063
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:57,240
the intelligence community pretty much

1064
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:00,330
still what it used to be and what it is

1065
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,129
I mean first of all it's worth

1066
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,600
mentioning it's a two-way flow it's not

1067
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,210
also about it's not just about what

1068
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,380
other agencies can learn from how

1069
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:09,540
intelligence agencies handle information

1070
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,640
it's also increasingly actually

1071
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,840
intelligence agencies realizing that

1072
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,270
instead of assuming that they are the

1073
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,710
repositories of all wisdom they can

1074
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:20,580
actually look out and see how a whole

1075
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:22,170
variety of other institutions gather it

1076
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,540
but particularly I mean I I would of

1077
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:26,670
course mentioned the British model which

1078
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,460
is naturally the the finest in all the

1079
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:31,830
world but but interestingly because in

1080
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,380
in Britain ultimately it is the Cabinet

1081
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:37,230
Office which is the sort of primary

1082
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:40,200
connection point between the activities

1083
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,580
of the agencies and policymaking through

1084
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,839
the institution of the Joint

1085
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,430
Intelligence Committee and so forth I

1086
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,020
won't go into the minutiae i but the

1087
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,330
point is the Cabinet Office also has a

1088
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,190
much much wider remit as being the

1089
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,529
primary agency that supports the Prime

1090
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:55,200
Minister and and cabinet and although

1091
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:58,369
clearly the the secure bit of the

1092
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,500
Cabinet Office is physically and

1093
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:04,260
institutionally fairly separate you do

1094
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,869
have exactly flow across and

1095
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,369
interestingly I I have spoken to two

1096
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:10,619
people who I know who work in the

1097
00:46:08,369 --> 00:46:12,150
Cabinet Office who talk about you know

1098
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:14,760
who are now no longer working in any

1099
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,650
spooky capacity but nonetheless it's

1100
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,440
quite fascinating how many of the same

1101
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:22,470
sort of terms about in the intelligence

1102
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,970
cycle and so forth has crept into how

1103
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:26,029
they look at precisely because nowadays

1104
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:29,189
I think after all governments are

1105
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:31,200
information handling machines and so

1106
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,880
what can be learned from from from the

1107
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,618
intelligence side to wider forms of

1108
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,420
government but I think that's particular

1109
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,340
particular situation because you have

1110
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,380
the same the same human

1111
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,730
Tyrael being involved in a whole variety

1112
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:46,440
of different cabinet office activities

1113
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:51,420
I'm not sure how broad it is question

1114
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:53,850
right there yeah each young like prosper

1115
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,440
Foundation Taiwan so uh the question

1116
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:57,450
sort of follow what the earlier question

1117
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,830
is but the issue is that how about the

1118
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,930
artificial intelligence and data

1119
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:02,759
analytics I really transform the way

1120
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:05,250
that we process usually in the past

1121
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,340
about the open source information and

1122
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:10,910
open source intelligence good point

1123
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:13,680
well thanks for making that point I

1124
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:16,200
think it increasingly makes the role but

1125
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,120
I think it is under it is something is I

1126
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,490
misunderstood that so artificial

1127
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:23,339
intelligence is fantastic in economic

1128
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,919
and weather predictions but that if you

1129
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:29,760
wanted to automate your predictions of

1130
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:33,330
how a politician a government a regime a

1131
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,400
terror organization wants to act in the

1132
00:47:33,330 --> 00:47:37,529
future you would have if in for

1133
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,410
artificial intelligence to be super

1134
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:43,140
effective to assume that they are by and

1135
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:44,810
large or mainly rational actors which in

1136
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,069
many often cases they are not

1137
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:49,680
so while weather predictions with

1138
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:52,050
artificial intelligence still are pretty

1139
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:54,720
you know touch-and-go at some times and

1140
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:56,640
we had many times the last year

1141
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,540
massive snowstorms in New York that

1142
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,540
never materialized

1143
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:06,840
predicting the behavior of a partial

1144
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,170
rational actor such as another

1145
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,460
government or regime and a massively

1146
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,270
irrational actor like a terrorist

1147
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:14,730
organization

1148
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:17,250
I don't think artificial intelligence is

1149
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:19,560
going to be making this qualitatively

1150
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:22,440
much better than it is right now because

1151
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:24,540
it still involves a art form where you

1152
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,670
put a puzzle together with the minimum

1153
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,320
amount of puzzle pieces and then you try

1154
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,540
to describe the picture that may or may

1155
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,830
not be emerging so you think a I can

1156
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,970
look back but it's not so good at

1157
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:38,330
looking forward not as far as I can see

1158
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:42,029
yes I agree with that I think AI will

1159
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:44,240
rise an importance of course we're going

1160
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:49,740
to be dealing with them increasingly

1161
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:51,109
vast volumes of data so of course we we

1162
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:54,078
will need that and a machine

1163
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:57,999
but to agree with you that they will

1164
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:01,940
always have to be an element of human

1165
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:04,098
analysis and an interpretation and also

1166
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:08,450
putting everything into context and an

1167
00:49:04,099 --> 00:49:12,049
all source intelligence of form so it's

1168
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:16,129
it's not the one hundred percent answer

1169
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:18,529
to everything the relative weight will

1170
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:22,249
grow but you have to see it in a broader

1171
00:49:18,529 --> 00:49:28,309
context just a I help you lay in your

1172
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:30,169
job spot fake news trends a state actor

1173
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:33,380
trying to put a message out there

1174
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:35,029
AI is extremely important in countering

1175
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,249
propaganda and disinformation because

1176
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:38,869
when you look at how much information is

1177
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:40,640
out there right now it's finding the

1178
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:41,809
signal in the noise so SIGINT you know

1179
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,129
they're they're listening to everything

1180
00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:45,739
but they want to find what actually

1181
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:48,289
matters from that AI can do a lot of

1182
00:49:45,739 --> 00:49:50,869
scooping up all that data that's out

1183
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:52,640
there and then doing some analytics but

1184
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:54,680
what's very important is continuing to

1185
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,118
inform the algorithm so you train the

1186
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,459
algorithm but you have to have that

1187
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,949
human in the loop that can then retrain

1188
00:49:58,459 --> 00:50:03,319
it or redevelop it or adjust course as

1189
00:50:00,949 --> 00:50:05,869
you go along and what we've really found

1190
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:08,089
where AI is particularly useful is when

1191
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:12,199
we can gather information in terms of

1192
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:14,569
trends what what what target audiences

1193
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:16,519
are being targeted by adversaries for

1194
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:18,019
disinformation campaigns how they're

1195
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:20,238
actually targeting them and what and

1196
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:21,439
then also how influential they're

1197
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:22,969
actually being because they we're not

1198
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,380
going to put resources on to a

1199
00:50:22,969 --> 00:50:25,969
disinformation campaign if it's not

1200
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,640
influencing anybody in the first place

1201
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:30,109
but what is really key is having human

1202
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,629
analysts who are able to take that

1203
00:50:30,109 --> 00:50:34,130
information and then help you understand

1204
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,640
what it actually means so those of us

1205
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:39,859
who operate countering propaganda and

1206
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,348
disinformation need that informed

1207
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:44,328
opinion from human analysts who have

1208
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:46,160
cultural expertise who have language

1209
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:47,839
expertise who understand the situation

1210
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,538
on the ground and that's always going to

1211
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,940
be key I do think AI can be helpful in

1212
00:50:50,539 --> 00:50:56,539
in some predictive measures I mean you

1213
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:59,509
look at you look at how much advertisers

1214
00:50:56,539 --> 00:51:01,069
can can be focused on people based on

1215
00:50:59,509 --> 00:51:03,499
what they're clicking on when they're

1216
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:04,950
online right so it can be somewhat

1217
00:51:03,499 --> 00:51:06,689
predictive but ultimately that he

1218
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:09,180
the loop is gonna be extremely important

1219
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:10,890
now I'm gonna take advantage of having

1220
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:15,240
you here I mean when your office was

1221
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:17,310
first set up it some journalists may

1222
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,578
have derisive ly said it was tweeting at

1223
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:24,240
terrorists you just talked about using

1224
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:26,550
AI and this information to analyze how

1225
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:28,140
people are basically getting messaged

1226
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:31,070
how propaganda is delivered to them and

1227
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:33,270
then what how do you counter it because

1228
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:35,640
the US isn't supposed to spread

1229
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:37,650
propaganda to its own people but

1230
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,290
propaganda is getting spread at them and

1231
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:42,390
I mean be very clear we don't the truth

1232
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:44,369
is on our side so in fact in our

1233
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:46,560
legislation that established the global

1234
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:48,510
engagement Center it tells us that we

1235
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,609
should be using fact-based narratives

1236
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:52,230
and when we talk about open source

1237
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:54,598
information a lot of the groups that are

1238
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:56,250
out there doing Osen are focused on

1239
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:57,750
finding the truth and discovering what

1240
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,599
is actually truthful so it's very

1241
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:01,950
important to know you mentioned tweeting

1242
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,250
it terrorists and for those of you who

1243
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:07,980
don't know what what is now called the

1244
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:10,069
GE see the the organization that was

1245
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,839
first stood up that had a different name

1246
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:14,369
was initially set up because terrorists

1247
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:16,440
were using the Internet to radicalize

1248
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:17,910
people online and it was the question

1249
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,920
was we've got to do something about this

1250
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:22,770
we can't just leave this space and

1251
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,510
Internet chat rooms uncontested so we

1252
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:26,640
have had iterations of how we go about

1253
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,230
countering propaganda from terrorist

1254
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,730
organizations and countering

1255
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:32,069
disinformation and that has evolved over

1256
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,750
time so what we've learned is that just

1257
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:36,180
the point-to-point game of whack-a-mole

1258
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:38,640
is not nearly as effective as building

1259
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,950
resiliency in populations so like I was

1260
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,240
saying before getting people to think

1261
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:44,009
twice when they read something online

1262
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,109
when they see a picture online getting

1263
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:47,369
them to think twice is this real if I

1264
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:48,569
haven't heard about this maybe there's a

1265
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:51,300
reason maybe it's something that's not

1266
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:53,220
even true so we can do that by training

1267
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,470
journalists to do investigative

1268
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:57,089
journalism to spot disinformation and we

1269
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:59,609
can do that by funding organizations

1270
00:52:57,089 --> 00:53:01,890
that get out there and have more

1271
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:03,750
resources than we do to Smart

1272
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:06,000
disinformation we can do it by funding

1273
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,800
organizations that develop algorithms

1274
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,880
and the developed technology that can

1275
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,950
spot disinformation

1276
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,569
for example organizations that can

1277
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:14,549
develop essentially a bot where if

1278
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:15,990
someone finds an article online and they

1279
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:18,510
want to know if it's true they can send

1280
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,990
it to that bot and it will basically a

1281
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,960
set

1282
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:23,279
based on an algorithm the likelihood

1283
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,960
that it's actually true

1284
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,150
and it can also run it against different

1285
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,680
IP addresses that are typically known

1286
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:30,000
for spreading disinformation so there's

1287
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,970
a number of different ways that we that

1288
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,200
we counter propaganda and disinformation

1289
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:35,520
but a big part of that is building

1290
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:40,980
resiliency in populations

1291
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:43,350
I was just educated by the Forbes

1292
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,580
representative at the conference about

1293
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:47,130
the Eurobarometer

1294
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:50,640
is anyone familiar with it so this is an

1295
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:53,190
EU tool of getting a vetted and verified

1296
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:56,310
way to reach out and pull the opinions

1297
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:59,040
of European citizens and what I'm

1298
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:01,020
surprised by is that governments don't

1299
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,300
create more ways other than voting every

1300
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,280
couple of years to gauge people's

1301
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,120
opinions because that becomes an

1302
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,610
important part of open-source

1303
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:10,460
information you know if if there's a

1304
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:15,740
trend on Twitter that makes it look like

1305
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:18,570
everybody hates I don't know lima beans

1306
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:20,430
but you can pull them and figure out oh

1307
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:22,350
actually no people don't hate lima beans

1308
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:26,759
that's disinformation according to this

1309
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:30,750
verified poll that we all trust I kind

1310
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,510
of like a Bitcoin for public opinion I'm

1311
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:36,240
taking it back government at least my

1312
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:38,700
government pulls people all the time on

1313
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:40,049
just about anything you can imagine so I

1314
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,089
wouldn't say that governments don't

1315
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:44,670
poorer and I'm quite sure the American

1316
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:46,500
government may hesitate to Paul once in

1317
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,970
awhile so I think polling is going on

1318
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:52,260
the whole time

1319
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:56,279
the question really is whether this

1320
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:58,350
amount of misinformation and deep fakes

1321
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,570
and manipulation that that's going on

1322
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:03,180
via the internet whether you can

1323
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:05,330
actually get your polling sample in a

1324
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,680
way that it's now actually

1325
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:09,870
representative of what the population

1326
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,640
actually feels I think that's the

1327
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:16,020
problem with polling right now that your

1328
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:18,779
sample collection who do you poll it's

1329
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,340
getting actual opinion is getting far

1330
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:25,440
more complex and I think all the

1331
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:27,150
election polling 2016 for brexit and for

1332
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,520
for the American presidential elections

1333
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,960
were a absolute rining example how

1334
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,300
difficult it is and how wrong you can

1335
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,640
get

1336
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:37,330
then a year later with a bridge election

1337
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:39,819
again the polls were pretty off by by a

1338
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:42,670
surprisingly large margin so the the

1339
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:46,840
sample the sampling of your polling is

1340
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:48,850
getting more difficult I think also you

1341
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,920
know polling is one thing but it's kind

1342
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:53,710
of like how many likes something gets

1343
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:55,420
online compared to what action somebody

1344
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:57,220
actually takes so it's a big difference

1345
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,020
between what somebody might say when

1346
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:01,569
they're when they're pulled versus what

1347
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:03,580
action they take by actually going to

1348
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:05,440
vote and then you know what they who

1349
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:07,060
they actually vote for when they do you

1350
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,830
use the example of Lima beans whether

1351
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:10,120
somebody likes lima beans or not is

1352
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,950
different from whether they actually go

1353
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,420
buy them at the store and so that's what

1354
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:15,100
we have to really look at is the actions

1355
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,590
true and I hope I haven't offended any

1356
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:21,759
lima bean fans in the audience we

1357
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:23,920
haven't just one cent commonplace in

1358
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,510
many European countries and the key

1359
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,910
thing is who that who conducts the

1360
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:29,980
polling how much trust there is in in

1361
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:33,509
this organization your barometer is one

1362
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:36,160
example than many others so we have just

1363
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:37,690
time we have like two minutes left so

1364
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:41,859
can we rock it through two questions

1365
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:43,480
really fast here captain John Jacobs not

1366
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,060
here on military anything just wearing a

1367
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,860
uniform because I can my previous

1368
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,150
posting was a public affair so people

1369
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,380
asked like what do you do I set right

1370
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:53,320
the enemy does propaganda we do

1371
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:55,510
engagements just as a joke well we did

1372
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,100
see a convergence between say what the

1373
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:59,020
security officer said that we couldn't

1374
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:01,390
show and talk about and we of course

1375
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,430
wanted to talk about two extremes now

1376
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:05,560
becoming a horseshoe how do you see that

1377
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:07,120
Nexus what role US open source

1378
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,430
information playing that what rulers are

1379
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:12,609
pouched rats common info ops have it

1380
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:18,270
intelligence gathering let's make that

1381
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:18,270
the last one and then sorry one more

1382
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:22,799
agna Deloitte cybersecurity I just want

1383
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,000
to ask because he talked about

1384
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,210
intelligence sharing and working

1385
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
together among states mostly interested

1386
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:33,310
in how do you it seems like sometimes we

1387
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,710
are locked in intelligence paradox so

1388
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:37,960
and intelligence sharing a paradox so

1389
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:41,290
how do you overcome that paradox how do

1390
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,750
you we utilize the resources and better

1391
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:45,080
share the states that act upon that

1392
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:48,320
preventing

1393
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:50,990
big disasters Thanks okay so everybody

1394
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:52,600
has 30 seconds each to finish who wants

1395
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,919
to go first

1396
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,140
Lia well I'll say you look great in your

1397
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,580
uniform so I would wear mine too if I

1398
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,290
could because you look fat you look

1399
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,819
fabulous but um to answer your question

1400
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,320
about public affairs and the sharing of

1401
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:04,940
information versus not sharing your

1402
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,200
information I think a lot of times it

1403
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:08,030
comes down to what I was saying before

1404
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:10,149
about what the source is and does

1405
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:12,860
sharing the information ultimately

1406
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:14,480
compromise the future use of the source

1407
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,520
and the methodology of which that

1408
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,770
information was obtained so I think when

1409
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,000
you look at open source intelligent open

1410
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:22,100
source intelligence it opens a lot of

1411
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,380
doors because if it's unclassified

1412
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:26,990
information or if it's openly that the

1413
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:28,190
methodology is openly used then it opens

1414
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:34,450
a lot of doors in terms of what you can

1415
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:38,000
share so security is absolutely key for

1416
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:39,560
sharing intelligence in my

1417
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,400
two-and-a-half years and in this

1418
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,710
position

1419
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:46,310
I I've learned that very well and we are

1420
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:49,220
putting enormous efforts into you know

1421
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:51,259
the technical basis of of improving

1422
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:55,700
security for intelligence sharing we

1423
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:58,820
look at our systems we do cyber hygiene

1424
00:58:55,700 --> 00:59:01,640
we define exactly who Li and users are

1425
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:06,020
and all of that is really the the basis

1426
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:08,450
to convince nation services to to share

1427
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:09,020
valuable intelligence with us as to

1428
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:12,490
thoughts

1429
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:14,300
yeah and just as a painful reminder

1430
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:18,339
understanding what the other side is

1431
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:22,160
actually saying is is really difficult

1432
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:24,380
you have to have a common language I

1433
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:28,129
seem to remember there was something

1434
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:31,730
about trucks and laboratories in just

1435
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:33,860
before a war started in 2003 that may or

1436
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:35,350
may not have come from from our service

1437
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,730
and there was simply not enough

1438
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:40,819
understanding that this was a crazy

1439
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:43,520
person and that just got lost in the

1440
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:45,560
sharing so it's not just the question do

1441
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,480
you trust the other side there was no

1442
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,130
trust issues it's not a question whether

1443
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,480
you do not trust their information

1444
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:53,360
storage there was no concern about that

1445
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,810
they simply did not understand what was

1446
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:58,820
set to them and that led to fairly

1447
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:00,950
consequential outcomes that we're not

1448
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:03,320
not good for either side and if you can

1449
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:04,370
go common language is the other hurdle

1450
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:06,110
of intelligence-sharing

1451
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:08,509
unless you're talking about the very

1452
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:10,250
simple data you know the here's the name

1453
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:13,070
here's the birth date when it comes to

1454
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:14,810
complex issues it's really important to

1455
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:17,180
understand what moderate confidence

1456
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:18,650
means because it may mean something

1457
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,149
totally different for the other side

1458
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:21,410
they need us for your side and

1459
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,390
unfortunately we don't have time to get

1460
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:25,339
into the Iraq war and how everyone

1461
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:28,490
trusted one source too much because they

1462
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:29,960
trusted each other our last thought the

1463
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:32,290
best opinion polls are back in the

1464
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,460
Soviet days were carried out by the KGB

1465
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,630
though obviously they did not say they

1466
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:38,750
were the KGB when they were asking

1467
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:40,340
people questions and in fact they were

1468
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:42,200
really surprisingly good at

1469
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:45,380
understanding the attitudes of the

1470
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:47,180
Soviet population however I went to have

1471
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,470
a conversation with a veteran in those

1472
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,669
times who said one of the big problems

1473
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:50,899
though was actually getting people in

1474
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:53,810
the Central Committee of the Communist

1475
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:55,130
Party to actually believe our surveys so

1476
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,509
they said well once we managed to crack

1477
01:00:55,130 --> 01:00:59,000
into I think it might have been in our

1478
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:02,180
ferl but anyway an American or a Western

1479
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,790
based opinion survey of Emma Grace which

1480
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:07,220
they could then use to bulk up their own

1481
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:08,930
surveys and at that point suddenly the

1482
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:11,180
Communist Party thought oh well maybe

1483
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:13,190
we'll believe this because the Americans

1484
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:14,899
are proving it one of the problems is

1485
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:15,980
exactly the open source can provide you

1486
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,220
with this vast amounts of information

1487
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:21,770
but actually getting it into

1488
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:23,180
policymaking often is is the challenge

1489
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:25,880
because people think that if it's not

1490
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:28,970
bought hard then it can't necessarily be

1491
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:31,400
trusted and with that I want to thank

1492
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:33,950
everyone for coming to this open source

1493
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:36,410
intelligence panel and if you all could

1494
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:37,910
wait just a moment as the panelists

1495
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:40,399
leave the stage if you want to chat with

1496
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:41,810
them they'll be right outside we're

1497
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,030
going to go straight into the cyber

1498
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:47,279
defense panels so if you guys could head

1499
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:55,929
out the door before you get mired

1500
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:55,929
