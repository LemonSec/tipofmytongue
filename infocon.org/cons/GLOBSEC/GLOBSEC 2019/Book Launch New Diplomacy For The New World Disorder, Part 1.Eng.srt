00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:08,969
good afternoon welcome to a two-part

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:12,059
panel on new diplomacy for new conflicts

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,799
as tentatively has been described in the

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,080
description of the panel you may see

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:21,689
that it deals with a new volume that is

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,089
assumed to be out and it's a special

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:27,269
issue in the Journal of global policy

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,179
and the first part of this panel is

9
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,870
going to introduce the main ideas that

10
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:35,519
have been at the core of this special

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,430
issue it is my distinct pleasure to

12

worker on publishing as much as possible

19

36
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,860
further ado I would like to give the

37
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,630
floor to Professor resort Minh to

38
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,539
introduce the volume and set the stage

39
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:57,479
for our further discussions professor

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:59,640
zartmann I don't does that carry yeah

41
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,740
okay I I don't know whether the

42
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,560
organizers of this conference realized

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,419
the deublin tanka that they had in the

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,119
classy title that they gave to this

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,120
navigating through disruption that is

46
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,349
obviously finding your way through the

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,870
disruption

48
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,869
but it also means and this is what we

49
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,749
want to focus on navigating by means of

50
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,459
destroy disruption and that's very much

51
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:25,200
the topic that we're looking at we're no

52
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,569
longer in a system of world order we're

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,119
in a system a world disorder in which

54
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:33,450
entropy is rising tremendously at a

55
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,389
number of different levels we have a

56
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:40,858
multi-state system with non-ideological

57
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:42,840
power plays both on the international

58
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:45,859
level and on the regional level

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,719
there's no blocks there's no hegemon and

60
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:51,060
what the players like above all to find

61
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,000
is vacuums that they can move into

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,150
before somebody else moves in to fill

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,439
vacuums for power reasons and there's

64
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:04,439
normative chaos in the current system

65
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:08,310
and as somebody said earlier in one of

66
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:14,489
the sessions the rules and norms that we

67
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:17,879
all that we all believe in are being

68
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,319
mantled dismantled as we speak and that

69
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,780
was a very good in an earlier session

70
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,220
introduction to what we're talking about

71
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,229
norms what norms are we talking about

72
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,269
norms of the conquest of territory the

73
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:29,269
treatment of refugees and IDPs and

74
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,590
treatment of dissidents international

75
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:33,900
territorial integrity weapons of mass

76
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,579
destruction trade practices national

77
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,099
self-determination protection of

78
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:44,060
population humanitarian assistance are

79
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:47,728
all subject to crumbling norms in

80
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:50,099
international regimes are also melting

81
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,750
down international regimes on

82
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,328
international trade on non-proliferation

83
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,189
and climate change on security through

84
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:02,310
the United Nations Security Council and

85
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:05,459
the ICC and of of territorial waters we

86
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,150
no longer go by organizations that carry

87
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,549
out norms on these important subjects

88
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:14,849
state dysfunction is rampant in many

89
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,590
parts of the world the states aren't

90
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:19,349
breaking apart as they used to a

91
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,710
recession is section but they're

92
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:27,330
crumbling into little pieces and

93
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:31,469
and non-state armed groups are taking

94
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:34,169
over security functions within pieces of

95
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,889
the state with no goal particularly in

96
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:41,460
in mind the non-state and proto state

97
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:44,550
actors are impervious to international

98
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,258
attempts to try to bring conflict under

99
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:49,440
control they don't care they continue

100
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:52,020
and do what they want again I say rather

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,020
aimlessly and finally there's the rise

102
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,758
of national disasters national disasters

103
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,430
are always around for us but they're not

104
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,440
not the disasters because of nature but

105
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:05,660
because of what man does not do about

106
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:10,650
them opioid drought the migratory fish

107
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:14,820
cholera and water deficiency for some

108
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:16,979
states in addition even more striking

109
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,560
perhaps for the interests of all of us

110
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,960
here in the last decade there have been

111
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,210
a number of striking attempts serious

112
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,090
attempts at conflict management that

113
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,310
have failed not simply conflicts that

114
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,039
continued but it attempts to bring the

115
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,440
conflict under control and that have

116
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,259
have broken down and not gotten anywhere

117
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,990
I needn't remind you of the list of them

118
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,509
Yemen and and Libya and Syria and the

119
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,940
GCC and Somalia and South Sudan in

120
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,409
northern mountain of northern Nigeria

121
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,199
and Mali in the Central African Republic

122
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:52,169
in Afghanistan and in the Philippines

123
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,530
Abu Sayyaf in the NPA and then when you

124
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:58,049
get off land in the South China Sea

125
00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:01,109
attempts made to bring conflicts under

126
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,690
control that have failed why and it's

127
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,360
striking that they all have some common

128
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,280
elements that have kept them from

129
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,460
arriving at some kind of reconciliation

130
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,710
first of all they're all stalemated but

131
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,599
the stalemate doesn't hurt and the

132
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,388
countries either arm themselves against

133
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,979
hurt or won't feel it or else their help

134
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,199
from the outside so that the hurt isn't

135
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:25,430
felt so bad and so we don't have a ripe

136
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,820
solution a situation for resolution

137
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:32,219
there are no searches for trade-offs one

138
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,810
side is saying I won't accept anything

139
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:34,580
that you're offering me because you're

140
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,590
bad and

141
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,930
and shouldn't be there anyhow and so

142
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,489
people are not looking for trade-offs to

143
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,770
resolve the conflict and at the same

144
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,920
time there's no interest in reframing

145
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:48,020
the conflict in such a way that perhaps

146
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,900
we can redefine it in a way that's

147
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,210
beneficial to to both of us there's no

148
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,700
support for the mediator and the

149
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,760
Security Council sends out mediators

150
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,409
cuts his hands off and says tries to try

151
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,690
to walk through this conflict as best

152
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,240
you can cuts his feet off in fact so

153
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,960
that you have Kofi Annan coming up with

154
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,600
his guidelines in Syria the the UNSC did

155
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,580
not publish those guidelines for two

156
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:18,410
years a striking example of mediator set

157
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:22,310
out without any support from the

158
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:24,020
mandating agency and then outside states

159
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,350
are interested not in conflict

160
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:30,859
management but in the conflict and they

161
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:33,620
see a vacuum a role to play there either

162
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:36,410
for proxies or or simply to keep other

163
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:41,290
states from getting in there and so we

164
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:44,810
have navigating by means of disruption

165
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:48,290
somebody earlier today said what are the

166
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:51,680
little things that we can do to change

167
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:53,900
the momentum and our project here is

168
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,300
trying to come up with little things not

169
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,520
systems of world order that we put in

170
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,890
place by Fiat but little things that we

171
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,479
can do to make a difference and I'll

172
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,460
just tick them off in the same haste

173
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:09,620
that I've talked about the earlier

174
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:12,049
problems we can it's important to return

175
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,690
to the idea of state building it's

176
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,690
important to build States

177
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,520
internationally it's important to build

178
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,880
problem-solving groups that is groups of

179
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,500
states and NGOs who are interested in

180
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,469
solving a problem without waiting for a

181
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,110
mandate from the the UN it's important

182
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,330
to give mediators support again by

183
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,120
individual states who are interested

184
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,870
even if the UN falls through as it does

185
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,450
it's important to build multilateral

186
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,789
coalition's to deal with problems

187
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:46,390
including coalition's of the Willing

188
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,120
when a legal coalition is not legal by

189
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,009
institutional laws

190
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,329
it's important to bring together teams

191
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:56,999
of rivals states that are competing over

192
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:59,969
a particular issue or conflict or place

193
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:02,610
and say ok you all have different aims

194
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,649
but let's try to see if we can't meet

195
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,649
somewhere to bring these under control

196
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,620
and to stop the killing of human beings

197
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:13,470
as we did in Cambodia in ninety or as we

198
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,009
tried to do a good process with the

199
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:19,939
six-party talks in in Korea it's

200
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:22,649
important to encourage regional security

201
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:25,099
communities so that states in a region

202
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,720
get together share defense information

203
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,319
pledged not to attack each other and

204
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,199
then turn to solving their problems in

205
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:37,019
this type of increased security

206
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:38,939
situation these are all procedural

207
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,670
suggestions that we might take up and

208
00:09:38,939 --> 00:09:43,349
apply in various places and there are

209
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:46,498
some substantive suggestions as well

210
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:50,269
it's it's worthwhile thinking about

211
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:54,449
reviving historical mechanisms such as

212
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:57,529
marches or neutral zones or autonomy or

213
00:09:54,449 --> 00:10:01,139
non sovereign self-government or

214
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:04,980
self-determination it's important to pay

215
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,870
attention to status concerns because

216
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,959
many of the conflicts that we see now

217
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,329
are people whose status has been

218
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,209
insulted they feel with a historic

219
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:18,439
background it's important to develop

220
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:21,329
mechanisms for the accountability of

221
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:22,529
humanitarian aid humanitarian aid goes

222
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,779
to southern Sudan

223
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,059
it goes to the rulers of southern Sudan

224
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:29,759
it never gets to the humanitarian tire

225
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,129
targets it all goes into their pockets

226
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:36,149
and then we wonder why they can't find a

227
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:39,019
solution to the to the conflict it's

228
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:42,809
important to work with local communities

229
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:44,939
if the government is unmanageable it's

230
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,429
important to get into local communities

231
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:49,050
and help strength of them as the United

232
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:53,459
States for example did with as a year

233
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:55,439
back in the last days of Mobutu it's

234
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:59,008
important to pay attention to post

235
00:10:55,439 --> 00:11:00,160
vention that is prevention by attention

236
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,190
to

237
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,370
happens after an agreement because we

238
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,220
tend to make an agreement and go home

239
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:12,430
satisfied that the job is open and it's

240
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,959
important and more broadly to restore

241
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:24,339
the level of permissibility to raise the

242
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:26,128
threshold of what one dare not do so

243
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,689
that we can think of normative

244
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:32,110
limitations on our actions and I could

245
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:37,629
go on thank you Thank You professor

246
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:40,000
sermon gallery your paperwork was on

247
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:41,050
reconciliation processes in the Middle

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
East

249
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,079
you'd like to share some thoughts about

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,850
that limits of reconciliation Mora

251
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:53,589
thank you very much Tunisia yes the

252
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:55,750
question is rather simple is what is the

253
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:58,300
role of mediators in dealing with the

254
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,129
past basically and the starting point is

255
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,069
the following in the aftermath of

256
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:05,290
violent conflict the significance of

257
00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:07,540
memory issues is paramount

258
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,579
the israeli-palestinian case is very

259
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:12,969
telling in this regard the succession of

260
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:16,870
crises and tensions over simplified and

261
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,060
radicalized narratives of of both sides

262
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,569
and today the representations of the

263
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,279
past are not only diverging but

264
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:28,180
incompatible think about the

265
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:30,699
interpretations given to the 1948 war or

266
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,649
to the origins of the Palestinian

267
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:35,920
refugee question or to the plethora of

268
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:38,079
the mosques enriched in Jerusalem

269
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,620
so all these examples illustrate the gap

270
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,550
between contradictory narratives so the

271
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:46,360
question is how can mediators address

272
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:52,420
contradictory narratives

273
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:54,670
well I suggest in the in the article to

274
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:57,790
me to maybe take into consideration

275
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:00,069
three potential attitudes the first one

276
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:05,649
could be summarized by the formula

277
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:07,599
neither nor its tabula rasa attitude if

278
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:10,019
you want needed the Israeli

279
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,759
representation nor the Palestinian one

280
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,250
and the argument is simple there is a

281
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:16,670
race

282
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:19,490
that telling stories of the violence may

283
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:22,279
justify the next round of violence so

284
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:25,220
it's wise not to explicitly address the

285
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,319
past that was the explicit argument

286
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,269
during the Oslo process negotiators

287
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:32,240
explained that they could debate the

288
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:34,459
past four years and never agree so the

289
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,579
objective was to agree about the future

290
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:41,689
and they concealed all the references to

291
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:44,930
the past I would have a lot of examples

292
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:47,540
I have one one another one just one

293
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,069
concrete example Bill Clinton confirmed

294
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,579
this position during the Camp David

295
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:54,649
talks one of the Palestinian negotiators

296
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:58,489
referred to the situation that followed

297
00:13:54,649 --> 00:14:03,790
the Shoah in Europe to justify the call

298
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:07,370
for compensation for what happened in

299
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:10,399
1948 and this analogy this historical

300
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,610
analogy was instantly rejected by the

301
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,829
Israeli negotiator who considered that

302
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,870
both contexts were fundamentally

303
00:14:15,829 --> 00:14:20,989
different and Bill Clinton agreed of

304
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,850
course we cannot compare so that was

305
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,230
really the attitude let us not argue

306
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,009
about the past

307
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,079
first attitude well in the field the

308
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:32,930
concealment of historical narratives

309
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,790
does not mean that the emotions not the

310
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:38,839
narrative but the emotions that are

311
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:40,610
attached to the the narratives are can

312
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,329
disappear it can be concealed like that

313
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,879
as well so from a psychological

314
00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:50,359
perspective that's interesting to see

315
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,550
that all social psychology studies

316
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,790
demonstrate that children of the second

317
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,990
the third and the fourth generations

318
00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:02,469
still has strong feelings of resentment

319
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,949
shame guilt and victimhood a

320
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,139
victimization sorry

321
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:07,758
especially when passed in justices have

322
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,139
not been addressed by their parents

323
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,269
generation that's something that we

324
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:12,860
really we work on that with a team in

325
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:15,379
Leuven and the University of Van and

326
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:20,300
it's obvious so a second attitude might

327
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:22,579
might also be considered not the tabula

328
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:24,370
rasa just the opposite would be a can of

329
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,550
just juxtaposes

330
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,270
juxtaposition

331
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:32,240
we say that in English as well right so

332
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:35,240
not neither nor but we take all the

333
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,180
interpretations of the past what do I

334
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,310
mean that the mediators considered that

335
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,020
they are neither judges nor historians

336
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,060
so that they could that they should

337
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,100
respect all the interpretations I give

338
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,709
you an example concrete one jacque

339
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,760
shellacque former French president who

340
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:55,700
was talking and listening - yes arafat

341
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,790
at that time it was just after in the

342
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,550
aftermath of Camp David and yes Arafat

343
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,459
was explained that there was no trace

344
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:07,189
literally there was there is no trace of

345
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,960
any Jewish people a temple in Jerusalem

346
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,110
you know the argument and then Jacques

347
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,510
Chirac intervened quite brutally to say

348
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,780
the point is not to know whether these

349
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:19,550
roon ruins exist or not it is to respect

350
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,640
the representation of the other side

351
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,370
so here it's ok this is the

352
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,110
representation you have another and

353
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:30,770
representation we take them all and we

354
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,420
combine there is a textbook history

355
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:36,860
textbook that was based on this

356
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:40,360
principle made by six historians coming

357
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:43,130
from both sides and they could the only

358
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,100
the outcome that the the could reach was

359
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:49,310
for each page three colons

360
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:54,410
with Israeli narrative of 1948 Oh

361
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:57,079
an event blank and then the Palestinian

362
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:00,730
narrative and it should children could

363
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:04,400
make comments between the two narratives

364
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,410
first attitude neden or second attitude

365
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,230
both interpretations of the past third

366
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,240
attitude new common interpretation of

367
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,819
the path much more ambitious I would

368
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,980
call that kind of zigzag between the the

369
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:20,689
notions so it's on the one hand on the

370
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:22,880
other one much more ambitious yes since

371
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:28,280
the purpose is read to develop a shared

372
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,500
vision and to go to good to better form

373
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,800
stories it's a reexamination and you

374
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:36,590
know it requires to go beyond denial and

375
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,560
to acknowledge not only the facts but

376
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,209
also responsibility

377
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,760
but we can have discussion about that

378
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:46,780
it's a huge huge question to me it's far

379
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:51,780
too ambitious I would like to go to the

380
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:55,870
conclusion because right

381
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:58,690
the initial question was so if mediators

382
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,969
can reconfigure incompatible narratives

383
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,740
and Sue me the answer is no the

384
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:05,980
israeli-palestinian case reminds us that

385
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:09,280
third parties cannot control narratives

386
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,170
of the past yet third parties have a

387
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,450
role to play to remind the parties that

388
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,940
their narratives are not stable and

389
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:21,430
fixed once and for all there are stories

390
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:23,410
under construction right altum Utley I

391
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,660
think that the the question to me is

392
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,300
probably not about changing narratives

393
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:32,170
the way parties talk about the issues

394
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:34,270
but rather maybe changing postures in

395
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:39,100
terms of loyalty and it's one single

396
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:42,220
question in whose name do negotiators

397
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,520
refer to the past to whom should they

398
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:49,270
keep their promises to past current and

399
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:53,020
or future generations you could argue

400
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,790
but it's not incompatible well that's

401
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,530
not so easy but I guess that

402
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,600
consideration of children and

403
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:01,060
grandchildren can bring a dose of

404
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,949
much-needed creativity and flexibility

405
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:08,379
so one last question for each of you

406
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,570
isn't it crucial to honor no it is

407
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,880
crucial to honor past generation but

408
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,010
isn't it even more fundamental to

409
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,930
protect the interest of those to come

410
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:20,830
that's it Thank You Valerie

411
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:23,110
thank you Miko I won't introduce your

412
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,449
paper I think you'll do better justice

413
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,429
than I do so yeah thank you sanusha and

414
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,720
good afternoon thank you everyone for

415
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:32,340
coming

416
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:36,090
so as the Russians should probably do I

417
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:40,320
did I wrote a policy oriented discussion

418
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,399
piece for the journal addressing the

419
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,950
challenges to regional conflict

420
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,320
management arising from great power

421
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:51,430
rivalry and the most conflict ridden

422
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,260
great power

423
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:54,910
relations are those between the

424
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,950
established great powers the United

425
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:00,550
States and to the extent the European

426
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:03,490
Union on one hand and what end and and

427
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:06,430
those powers that we call aspiring and

428
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,920
aspiring doesn't mean rising it just

429
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,920
means dissatisfied with its current

430
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,360
status and and wanting wanting more

431
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,130
okay so inspiring and global powers

432
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,370
often leverage against each other the

433
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:24,059
conflicts that occur in in the

434
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:26,439
neighborhoods of those aspiring powers

435
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:31,480
the neighborhood such as the South China

436
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:34,260
Sea or post-soviet Eurasia so as we all

437
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:39,670
know China and Russia consider those

438
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:42,129
regions their spheres of special say

439
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,350
privileged historical zones of special

440
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,770
interest irrespective of the legal

441
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,719
grounds for such a view but the United

442
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,720
States and the European Union are of

443
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,429
course also interested in in those

444
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,980
contested regions because of their trade

445
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:58,870
and investment because of the security

446
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,020
concerns diaspora politics pressure

447
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:05,110
groups from the expert pressure from the

448
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:08,320
expert community and other groups that

449
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:11,199
have strong views about the global

450
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:15,580
powers policy towards those regions and

451
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,370
so as professor Hartman just noticed at

452
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:22,419
the end of the Cold War we witnessed

453
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:25,979
some surprising comity among or between

454
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:29,539
the the two superpowers

455
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,679
that actually ended up sorting out

456
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:33,809
cooperatively quite a few conflicts

457
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,169
across the globe beat Cambodia in Asia

458
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:39,360
one goal in Africa places in Central

459
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:42,919
America and so forth but over the

460
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,510
following two decades the spirit of

461
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:49,549
comity the spirit of cooperation in

462
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:52,769
managing regional conflict somehow

463
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:55,049
dissipated faded out so we are now faced

464
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:57,269
with the need for some new conflict

465
00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:02,000
resolution mechanisms or at least some

466
00:21:57,269 --> 00:22:06,269
ideas as to how we can overcome either

467
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,610
escalating or simmering conflicts in in

468
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:12,740
those contested neighborhoods or in some

469
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:16,289
more remote places like like Syria and

470
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,899
essentially the puzzle is as I think

471
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:21,149
professor zartmann also just hinted the

472
00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:24,360
puzzle is whether the leading powers the

473
00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:26,729
US and the EU could concede some status

474
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,830
to the aspiring powers in return for the

475
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,720
aspiring powers actually cooperating in

476
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,949
the mediation of those regional disputes

477
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:38,130
and and whether and how and and and and

478
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:40,049
how much the regional powers can

479
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,600
appreciate the benefits of conflicts

480
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:45,000
actually being resolved while they

481
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,010
receive credit for for their resolution

482
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,360
so that is something these are the

483
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:55,019
factors on which the actual willingness

484
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,639
of the parties to jointly may manage

485
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:58,769
those regional conflicts and resolve

486
00:22:56,639 --> 00:23:01,799
them may actually I may actually depend

487
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:04,500
and you certainly cannot think in terms

488
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:08,090
of grand bargains that would delineate

489
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,429
geographic areas of responsibility or

490
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:14,490
not speaking about spheres of influence

491
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:16,169
but what could perhaps be tried and I'm

492
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,419
trying to play with this notion in my

493
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:21,389
article is a web of negotiation fora

494
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:23,490
that would span and transcend the sports

495
00:23:21,389 --> 00:23:26,178
and the regions that are contested by

496
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,220
global and aspiring powers and

497
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:30,710
negotiation in a way is a pragmatic

498
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,980
give-and-take right so it doesn't

499
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:37,230
compromise any principles neither does

500
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,549
it imply interference in domestic

501
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:42,720
affairs and and we already have some

502
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:46,029
negotiation for in place such as the OSI

503
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,100
later Russia Council Shanghai

504
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:51,340
Cooperation Organization and so forth in

505
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,860
in in Eurasia but we need more

506
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,320
comprehensive platforms we were asked to

507
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,619
be normative in our pieces written for

508
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,428
the journal so I I played with the idea

509
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:05,320
that we could perhaps formalize some

510
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:07,929
regular security consultations involving

511
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,049
the United States Russia and China and

512
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:14,350
any number of relevant stakeholders in

513
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:16,418
post-soviet Eurasia abroad Eurasia

514
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,730
depending on the issue under under

515
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:21,340
discussion perhaps belt in road

516
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,859
countries plus the United States then

517
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,488
some key you members and the US a whole

518
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:29,649
could also Foom a negotiation platform

519
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:31,450
perhaps we could also think in terms of

520
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:34,389
trade zones plus that could involve

521
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:37,029
China the European Union and some states

522
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:39,459
in post-soviet Eurasia Asia and and

523
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:43,539
Europe so the point is that such a web

524
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:46,149
of bilateral and multilateral fora could

525
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:50,710
be relied upon at least as at least a

526
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:55,178
canary in the coalmine of conflict it is

527
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:57,279
supposed to be on what the international

528
00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:00,399
relations school Robert Cohen called

529
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,379
diffuse reciprocity and that is the

530
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,748
aspiring powers whose status is being

531
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:08,320
elevated would have to owner the

532
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:11,830
concerns of the global powers to keep

533
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,109
you know those valued negotiation for

534
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,639
running and of course they are play

535
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:17,350
there are plenty of stumbling blocks

536
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,299
there are plenty of obstacles that you

537
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,178
you need to overcome in order to put

538
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:25,389
those four in place or even make this

539
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:27,460
this proposal realistic and I guess you

540
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:31,389
you would first need to tackle the

541
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:33,460
widespread conviction among the on one

542
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:36,279
hand the global powers and and aspiring

543
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:40,330
powers on the other hand convictions

544
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:42,940
about their mutual weakening so you

545
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:46,389
think that the other party is is

546
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:48,460
actually in decline while your clout is

547
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:50,350
actually increasing and of course you

548
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,299
know you don't want to negotiate and

549
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,870
compromise now if you are getting

550
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:54,490
relative

551
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:57,059
stronger so you need to address those

552
00:25:54,490 --> 00:26:03,370
narratives in virtually all of those

553
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:05,580
nations that would somehow that would

554
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,620
somehow prioritize that would somehow

555
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,990
reflect the beliefs of their own rise

556
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,030
while their opponents I believe to be

557
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,130
declining and second weed we do have a

558
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,020
fundamental lack of trust for example

559
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:20,530
you can believe that you negotiation

560
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:22,540
counterpart is never an amenable to to

561
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,360
compromise has no track record of

562
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,000
compromise and that looked to be the

563
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,490
actual mutual perspectives of all the

564
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,770
policymakers in in the United States and

565
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,080
China in Russia and it ruins any

566
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:37,570
possibility of good faith negotiation

567
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,629
but but hopefully and that's my kind of

568
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:44,320
bottom line hopefully there's this

569
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:47,679
mighty challenge of all the rising cost

570
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,678
of uncertainty that that is going to

571
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,830
actually challenge those convictions and

572
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:56,230
so you you're going to have uncertainty

573
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,419
you're going to face it if you plan if

574
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,000
you really plan on waiting your opponent

575
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,340
out and so the actual trends in the

576
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,550
distribution of power are much more

577
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,860
complicated than someone's linear rise

578
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:11,980
or decline or someone's belief in a

579
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,620
linearized or decline and so as we look

580
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,330
back at history we'll will see that the

581
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,689
aspiring powers have successfully

582
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:21,879
negotiated their way into a number of

583
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,470
cool multilateral institutions on more

584
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,540
than one occasion look at the World

585
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,580
Trade Organization and China or Russia

586
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,340
in the Council of Europe and there's no

587
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:33,040
reason why that experience of overcoming

588
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,050
hurdles to mutual accommodation cannot

589
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:38,500
be replicated cannot be repeated

590
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:43,240
thank you thank you Michael I will try

591
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,590
to expedite the Q&A and just jump on it

592
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,290
and I would like to invite you to join

593
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,149
us at slide Oh calm as you can see on

594
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:52,540
the big screen and please post your

595
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:55,350
questions as we go by

596
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:58,210
Valerie I think this question was

597
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:01,060
intended to you but please everyone is

598
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,830
more than welcome to jump in the

599
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:04,480
question is what do you mean by changing

600
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,280
the narrative of the past especially

601
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,010
when it comes to the Palestinian case

602
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,960
is there any suggestion at least on a

603
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:13,540
policy level how this could be done and

604
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,360
potentially expanded to other examples

605
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:21,700
that are similarly salient and difficult

606
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:25,990
to fathom in the palestinian-israeli

607
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:28,210
case I have one very concrete example

608
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:31,240
maybe and otherwise I will give an

609
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:36,060
example in another case during the Taba

610
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:38,980
conference in 2001 Israeli negotiators

611
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:42,429
explicitly considered the right of

612
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:44,700
return of Palestinians refugees and one

613
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:47,380
of them started to acknowledge the

614
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:50,020
Palestinian tragedy that was the

615
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:53,230
first-ever reference at this level of

616
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:57,010
negotiation and it was really a shift in

617
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:59,710
the negotiations and and this shift was

618
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,290
made possible that's what we can see in

619
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,880
the testimony of the negotiator this

620
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,740
shift was made possible thanks to the

621
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,210
work of the so-called new historians in

622
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:13,630
Israel I do you remember it a long time

623
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:16,210
ago but it's not it's not the current

624
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,950
rent anymore but this was an official

625
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,000
shift if you want another one which is

626
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:29,610
more stable I hope when Jacques Chirac

627
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:32,980
in France in 1996 explicitly as for

628
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:37,120
apologizes on behalf of friends for the

629
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:43,500
druids raffles of the veld if that was a

630
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,500
major shift in the narrative that was

631
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,210
stressed in France and we have plenty of

632
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,120
cases like that I don't know whether it

633
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:55,110
makes sense thank you very much

634
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,370
last question if I may just jump in and

635
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:02,550
following up on professor assortments

636
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:05,979
and Miko's remarks can you just briefly

637
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:10,750
remind us why is it so problematic to

638
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:13,180
create grand systems over again and why

639
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:17,250
should we focus on the more regional or

640
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,250
local realities instead

641
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,179
well I think for my side that on the

642
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,870
part of both parties there's a

643
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:33,620
disinterest in grand systems there is a

644
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:36,709
feeling that the grand systems the last

645
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:40,540
being the bipolar system for the United

646
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:44,030
States the the unipolar system were

647
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:47,330
ineffective were demanded too much of us

648
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:50,210
didn't pay enough attention to us so we

649
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:54,110
felt badly served by the previous

650
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:58,070
institution constrained by by them and

651
00:30:54,110 --> 00:31:00,260
then we were surprised on both sides to

652
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,290
see that the other side taking advantage

653
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,990
of that vacuum of commitment and

654
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:07,850
commitment is power vacuum and

655
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,030
commitment to jump in and fill the

656
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:14,360
vacuum there's an absolute rule of

657
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:17,629
politics that vacuums will be filled and

658
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:22,399
then when you have status questions as I

659
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:25,730
both the mahalia and I know then it's

660
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:29,030
obvious that there are candidates to

661
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:32,000
fill that vacuum and then this increases

662
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:38,750
the disillusion and distrust of the

663
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,850
parties with a global type of system we

664
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,520
do have grand systems in place we have

665
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:47,020
the United States and its allies we have

666
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:49,429
this transatlantic relationship we have

667
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,639
more or less you know the European Union

668
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:55,400
in the United States with a global kind

669
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,150
of purview but my argument was rather

670
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:02,390
that in order to resolve some proxy

671
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:05,360
conflict so conflicts that risk that for

672
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:09,020
which there is a risk of becoming proxy

673
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,689
actually we need to strike a balance or

674
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:16,790
the right balance between on the one

675
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:18,620
hand the the scope of all the

676
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:21,500
stakeholders the the number of

677
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:24,168
stakeholders that there are that we want

678
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:27,710
to we want to bring to the table to

679
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:29,610
discuss those conflicts on one hand and

680
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,340
here I advocate for broad

681
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,080
for trans regional approaches to

682
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,750
discussing those conflicts whose only

683
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,199
then you may be able to address the

684
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:43,290
whole gamut of issues arising from from

685
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:46,350
seemingly local conflicts but conflict

686
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:50,070
but the one that has transfusion

687
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:52,889
repercussions so you have this number of

688
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:54,990
stakeholders that you involve on the one

689
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:57,270
hand and on the on the other hand that

690
00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:00,270
has to be balanced against the depth of

691
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:03,300
engagement of your all of those tech

692
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:05,670
stakeholders in in a negotiation fora in

693
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:08,820
in an arrangement let's say that is

694
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:13,130
going to address those regional issues

695
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:16,020
and here we are not going to anything

696
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:20,510
very much institutionalized is not going

697
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:23,370
to work it's not going to fly no binding

698
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:26,360
institutions are not going to work so I

699
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:30,540
was thinking in terms of just showing

700
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,820
goodwill in negotiation fora where the

701
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:37,440
fairly broad a number of participants

702
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:40,110
that would value those fora as a

703
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,320
platform for for interaction for

704
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:46,409
negotiation and perhaps I thought that

705
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:48,379
could be an optimal way of addressing

706
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:50,250
those regional conflicts that are

707
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:54,540
long-standing that are becoming

708
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:56,700
intractable and that that have more and

709
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,830
more features of being you know proxy

710
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,200
conflicts and and and actually being

711
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,780
embedded into the you know into the

712
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,010
international structures in the system

713
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,810
thank you Michael

714
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,260
last question because we have to

715
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:13,860
introduce another group and it goes back

716
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,630
to the issue of narratives do the

717
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,900
narratives of the past actually shape

718
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:21,060
the idea of nationalism and collective

719
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:25,740
memory so I wouldn't say that they're

720
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:28,110
mutually exclusive and if yes how not by

721
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:29,909
definition a narrative is ambivalent and

722
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:32,250
memories ambivalent so it's neither

723
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,319
positive nor negative assert it depends

724
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:37,560
on the the objective which is pursued

725
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,190
but in the aftermath of mass atrocities

726
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,949
you you don't have spontaneously a

727
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,559
narrative which is not nationally

728
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:49,319
you see what I mean because you are just

729
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:52,040
focusing on your victims and and I

730
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:54,569
completely understand that from a

731
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,609
psychological perspective what is

732
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:58,650
interesting is maybe the shift in the

733
00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:01,259
German narrative if there is a so-called

734
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,960
German narrative an erotic narrative

735
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:07,280
when I say just to come back to a detail

736
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,240
in the presentation I I said the Israeli

737
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,970
representation and the policy of course

738
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,598
there is no there are no there is no

739
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:19,649
like kind of two or Moschino and stand

740
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:22,260
standardised narratives but there are

741
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:25,640
less and less dissonance ease and and

742
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:28,799
and creative voices I have to say though

743
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,868
and so it's really I think that there

744
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:32,970
are two major factors to know whether it

745
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:36,750
is nationalistic or not nationalists

746
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,549
first timing when are we how many not

747
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,770
how many years but how many generations

748
00:35:38,549 --> 00:35:43,619
after the violence and second factors

749
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,809
leadership leadership is key thank you

750
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:47,730
very much for Larry please join me in a

751
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:49,829
round of applause for our first group of

752
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:54,210
panelists in presenting this special

753
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:57,390
issue and I would like to recommend that

754
00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:00,059
you look into the special issue because

755
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,828
the articles are now out on wiley

756
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:04,380
website and on the website of global

757
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:07,920
policy we will have flyers that you can

758
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:11,339
take with you to see the very impressive

759
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,280
collection of work policy relevant work

760
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:16,710
by academics and prax on the issues that

761
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:21,319
are most pertinent for today's global

762
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,319
order thank you very much and let me
