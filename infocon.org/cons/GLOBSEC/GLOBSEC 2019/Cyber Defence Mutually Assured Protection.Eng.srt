1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,410
welcome glad to have all of you here

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,540
today with us my name's Patrick Tucker

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,849
I'm technology editor but news website

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,290
defense one out of Washington DC and

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,570
we're gonna have an awesome discussion

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,038
right now about the future of public

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,430
private partnerships and cybersecurity

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,390
very important and interesting topic of

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:25,800
extreme relevance anybody that's looking

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,050
at the future of legislation helping to

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,630
secure massive enterprises or for that

12
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,000
matter your own emails and personal data

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,739
from attack I had a fantastic

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,860
conversation yesterday with a fellow

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,750
that's a affiliated with tracking

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,149
money-laundering and cyber crime in the

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,230
UN and he said one important takeaway

18
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,910
for me is that public-private

19
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,440
partnerships in cyber security are

20
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,239
absolutely essential and he spent the

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,260
next 20 minutes talking about that so

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,910
we're very fortunate to have this

23
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,829
incredible panel here today to discuss

24
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,260
it and with that let me introduce

25
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,449
Gregory Jarrett he is the head of US and

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:05,250
international security at BDO to give

27
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:07,979
some opening remarks Greg good afternoon

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,780
it's both a privilege and a pleasure for

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,900
me to be here today and have the

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,390
opportunity to talk with all of you I'm

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,130
very passionate about cyber security

32
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,479
I've been asked to keep my remarks to an

33
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,929
hour and 70 minutes

34
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,990
I'm kidding so I'll keep these remarks

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,530
hopefully quite brief I thought it might

36
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,689
be somewhat amusing at least for me to

37
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,840
ask a few questions and do a little

38
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,789
cyber security IQ quiz for all of you

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,700
because I'm assuming that most of you

40
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,240
are not an IT geek as I am and having

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,570
spent the last 30 35 years doing systems

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,130
engineering satellite communications

43
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,889
telecommunications and run in a cyber

44
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,089
security company which is great fun by

45
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,880
the way okay but let's tee up a few

46
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,270
questions and let's make it fairly easy

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,048
let's do a true/false okay so first

48
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:06,329
question is it true or false that the

49
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,610
cybersecurity marketplace in the world

50
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,319
today when we look at both hardware

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,840
software and professional service

52
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:17,170
is expected to grow from a little over

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,030
80 billion dollars in value to a hundred

54
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,819
and ten billion dollars over the next

55
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:26,739
two years what do you think is that true

56
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:28,929
or is that false it's true it's

57
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,400
absolutely true all right that was

58
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,950
pretty easy let's start with the next

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,260
one in terms of ransomware attacks how

60
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,730
many of you have ever seen heard or know

61
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,399
people that have been impacted by

62
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,689
ransomware attacks okay all right very

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,480
good

64
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:45,939
is it true or false that of all the

65
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,219
industries and sectors of business in

66
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:51,730
the world that the sector that is most

67
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:53,888
under attack by ransomware and the

68
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,379
encryption of database associated with

69
00:02:53,889 --> 00:03:01,750
ransom is the healthcare industry is

70
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:04,209
that true or false true it's absolutely

71
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,430
true most people don't realize they

72
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,290
think financial institutions probably

73
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,819
the greatest target but actually the

74
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,280
health care industry because it's

75
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,439
actually the honeypot of most valuable

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,359
information personal identifiable

77
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:20,138
information protected health information

78
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:22,209
as well as payment card information all

79
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,189
right let's move on how about spear

80
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,439
phishing everybody heard of spear

81
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:28,959
phishing anybody been victim of spear

82
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:34,120
phishing recently okay all right all

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,560
right so look so absolutely many people

84
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,650
don't know that they've actually been

85
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,759
attacked right or that their systems

86
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,780
have been compromised

87
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:45,939
so is it true or false that globally the

88
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,250
number of spear phishing attacks that

89
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:51,340
have been reported has increased by over

90
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:55,030
70% in the last year what do you think

91
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:58,299
is that true or false that's true okay

92
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,459
so while we're on the topics of email

93
00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:03,969
how many of you have heard of a concept

94
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,069
called business email compromises okay

95
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,888
it's one of the fastest internet-based

96
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:11,619
and cybersecurity scams that we've seen

97
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:13,900
growing over the last 18 months all over

98
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,048
the world and both the public sector and

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:21,159
the private sector and in case you're

100
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:23,169
wondering I lead about 2,500 IT and

101
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:26,020
cyber security professionals currently

102
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,780
located in 31 countries on six

103
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,150
continents running three global security

104
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,909
operation centers I don't get a lot of

105
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:35,919
sleep okay and I get contacted by

106
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,230
government agencies as well as

107
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,510
commercial companies on what they can do

108
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,700
and how they can spend their money more

109
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,590
wisely one of the biggest problems

110
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,440
they're facing today is the Internet of

111
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:49,060
Things now the Internet of Things most

112
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,130
people look at and go wow this is

113
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,080
fantastic we're connecting all these

114
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,200
devices we're getting greater access to

115
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,050
information it is a phenomenon right I

116
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,789
look at it and go home I gosh look at

117
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,030
all the vulnerabilities that are being

118
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,000
put in place all the end points all the

119
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,289
potential areas that could be hacked so

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,320
you see I have a little different

121
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,180
perspective when we looked at from the

122
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,610
Gartner group Forrester Research and

123
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,130
other study groups the number of attacks

124
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,190
and how its increased with the growing

125
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,880
number of Internet connected devices

126
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,940
true or false

127
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,280
there was a 600 percent increase in the

128
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,540
number of cyber attacks on internet

129
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,520
connected devices

130
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:36,940
last year true or false absolutely true

131
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,770
okay so look I could go on and on and on

132
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,660
and I tell stories where most people

133
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,900
walk away going god that guy just scared

134
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:47,260
the out of me you know so I try not

135
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,359
to do that but we're at war today in the

136
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,400
United States and around the world and

137
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,220
there's three different groups that are

138
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,280
attacking our information they at the

139
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:59,350
government level at our local community

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,690
level and of course it all the

141
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:05,890
businesses and they're number one the

142
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:08,440
nation-states and make no doubt about it

143
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:11,409
that China leads in cyber security

144
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,080
attacks and what they've spent in terms

145
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,570
of funding and resources and technology

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,180
to enable these attacks disrupt

147
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:22,090
economies and the impact societies is

148
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,820
indeed significant okay second is Russia

149
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,789
third is Iran and fourth is North Korea

150
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,640
now there are other nation state

151
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,680
sponsored cyber attack groups but those

152
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,360
are the four major in the United States

153
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,150
we're dealing with those attacks across

154
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:40,750
every nape major industry on a day

155
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:42,609
basis and in the u.s. the biggest areas

156
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,710
of attack or the financial services

157
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,360
sector number one number two is the

158
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,250
healthcare industry which is largely

159
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,370
privatized in the United States and

160
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,990
third is our retail industry now close

161
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,850
behind that is the critical

162
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,000
infrastructure industries oil power

163
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,550
water gas and then next is our

164
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,639
manufacturing automotives but literally

165
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,139
every industry is under attack just a

166
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,560
couple days ago is speaking at a

167
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,630
cybersecurity event in Washington DC and

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,100
I literally had a gentleman in the room

169
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,389
almost in tears

170
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,830
it was the CEO of a very successful

171
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:20,650
not-for-profit organization doing

172
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,830
fabulous work and the Children's Aid

173
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,630
Research and he was literally in tears

174
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,520
because he just could not believe

175
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,180
anybody would do a business email

176
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,948
compromised attack and scam his

177
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,440
organization out of millions of dollars

178
00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:37,900
of donor money he just could not believe

179
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,610
somebody would do that and he said Greg

180
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,870
you know how did this happen I say well

181
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,660
there's these are not compassionate

182
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,490
people I said these are criminals and

183
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,800
they're looking for money you've got

184
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,990
money and they found an easy way because

185
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,930
you have minimal security so it's not

186
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,660
just about being the biggest company in

187
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,270
fact 30 percent in fact in the last year

188
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,310
37 percent of all cyber security attacks

189
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,120
were targeting small to mid-sized

190
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,789
companies

191
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,949
why not because they have so much money

192
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:08,260
or so much valuable information but it's

193
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,650
so much easier to penetrate are you with

194
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,380
me

195
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:14,830
they're the attackers are always looking

196
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,900
at what's the honeypot what's the the

197
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,460
value that we can monetize versus what's

198
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:22,270
the probability being able to penetrate

199
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,919
in an efficient way makes sense so let

200
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,810
me share some good news with you right

201
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,750
just so people don't say oh you know all

202
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,370
that guy says negative stuff right there

203
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,370
are tremendous technologies that are

204
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,169
available to us today to help us counter

205
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:38,580
these attacks these are what the guy is

206
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:41,319
like me the white hats try to do to

207
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,729
stave off the attacks or mitigate the

208
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,190
attacks once they occur

209
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,750
we have great technologies in machine

210
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,120
learning both structured and

211
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,740
unstructured we have great technologies

212
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,279
and things like

213
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,589
voice-activated capabilities big data

214
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,990
analytics platforms like ArcSight

215
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:01,230
platforms like Splunk that allow us to

216
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,639
gather vast amounts of machine language

217
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,249
interpret analyze that put it into

218
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,949
digital dashboards customize it so we

219
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:11,230
can do intelligence and analysis to

220
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:12,699
determine where a tax either came from

221
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,559
or where they might come from in the

222
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:16,498
future we have the ability to do

223
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,449
advanced encryption on software

224
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:21,970
multi-factor authentication we can do a

225
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:23,889
lot of very cool things and more and

226
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,110
more organizations are evolving to a

227
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:28,449
blockchain technology that provides a

228
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,300
much more inherently more secure

229
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:33,579
platform but here's the bad news with

230
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,878
all those technologies they all cost

231
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:38,679
money and they all take time to

232
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,720
implement and unfortunately most

233
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,300
government agencies and most commercial

234
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,339
companies are slow to make investments

235
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,339
slow to adopt the latest technologies

236
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,259
and often behind the power curve and if

237
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,869
you're a cyber attack or all you need to

238
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:55,899
do is find one vulnerability in a

239
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:58,480
network and before I turn it over to

240
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,759
this a very illustrious panel let me

241
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,800
share with you and this might sound

242
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,079
weird coming from a techie guys like me

243
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,019
but the weakest link is not in the

244
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:10,839
hardware it's not in the software it's

245
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,790
in the people all right and what you

246
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,209
really want to invest your money and if

247
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,399
nothing else is what I call a human

248
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:20,739
firewall and that's investing in the

249
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,610
education the awareness the training of

250
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:27,879
the people so that they're not gonna

251
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:31,509
click on that spam click on that

252
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:33,819
spearfishing go to that water hole go to

253
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:36,129
that and or open up that Trojan horse

254
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:38,589
software click on that link that they

255
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:40,420
should and all of those things introduce

256
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:42,370
malware and introduce potential

257
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,549
vulnerabilities to the organization

258
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,949
whether you're in government or industry

259
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:50,889
it's important to understand that the

260
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:53,349
weakest link is the humanly ok

261
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:54,910
so with that we're gonna have a lively

262
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,920
discussion my colleague is going to

263
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:59,100
facilitate thank you so much for joining

264
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,099
us

265
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:05,550
okay excellent well let me let me

266
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,200
welcome up our panel and thank you guys

267
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,750
so much for being a part of this again

268
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,550
please feel encouraged to send your

269
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,410
questions to slide outs that we can ask

270
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:18,180
them this is the habsburg room and the

271
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,250
code for this particular slide out

272
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,689
session is globe SEC 2019 so let me to

273
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,360
welcome to the stage

274
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,310
Moishe Chaka who is a member of the

275
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,670
European Parliament mr. Paul Cornish a

276
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:33,150
visiting professor from LSE and IDE

277
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,829
s in London excuse me ideas is all

278
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,260
capitalized in the catalogue it's not my

279
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:40,350
fault I was like oh hi okay and I yell

280
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:43,590
Bell is here chief global operations at

281
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:49,230
check out of Tel Aviv so welcome our

282
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:50,640
panelists the memorable cause first and

283
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,600
again the conversation that we're talk

284
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,970
about today is public/private

285
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,710
partnerships you all interact with

286
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,000
private companies all the time and you

287
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,320
give them a lots and lots of data and

288
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,430
you also interact with governments and

289
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,900
you hope the government keeps your data

290
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,939
safe in some way or another and there's

291
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,470
a lot of discussion and thought about

292
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,810
the best way both of those two things

293
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,390
can handle that so let me start with you

294
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,849
guys how do you characterize the current

295
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:14,330
state of public-private partnerships in

296
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:16,680
cybersecurity and what do you see as the

297
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,200
important trend in that in the next five

298
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,979
years start with you in reach' good

299
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,450
afternoon everybody

300
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:27,270
I actually think one of the one of the

301
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,950
often overlooked areas when it comes to

302
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,770
public-private partnerships is the

303
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,020
dependence the the question of how to

304
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,689
safeguard the public interest how to

305
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,230
ensure that government plays the role it

306
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:42,780
has to like you know when I when I hear

307
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:45,780
statements like we are at war we should

308
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:48,089
ask ourselves who is defending us and

309
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,459
where is the oversight and the control

310
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,040
and accountability of that defense and

311
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,020
so areas like proliferation of

312
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,610
government procured technologies so

313
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,439
where the government says we need these

314
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,930
kinds of critical infrastructures or

315
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,420
cybersecurity measures put those

316
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,219
products or demands in the market help

317
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,530
foster those innovations that you spoke

318
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,690
about but then where does this knowledge

319
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,759
go and how do you make sure that you're

320
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:15,060
not knowingly your unknown

321
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,939
essentially assisting your opponents

322
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,550
whether they be States or or the private

323
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:22,079
sector in waging that quote-unquote war

324
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,079
which I think is a strong term but you

325
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,469
know those attacks against your very own

326
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,120
interest so while I believe

327
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,220
public-private partnerships are vital

328
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,040
and and they're you know part of

329
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,339
everything digital and everything

330
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,589
cyber related I'm very interested in the

331
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,019
rule of law online on accountability on

332
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,750
non-proliferation and making sure that

333
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,759
there is a protection also of the public

334
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:53,459
interest even as private sector

335
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:55,620
companies are engaged Thanks I would say

336
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,079
I'd characterize it as well first of all

337
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,850
let me let me say that I think the best

338
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,560
way to think of the public sector is to

339
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,329
take a very broad definition so not just

340
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,729
government but everything else as well

341
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:07,019
as I think you said nature and I'd

342
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,670
characterize the relationship between

343
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,410
public sector broadly defined and

344
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,329
private sector perhaps more narrowly

345
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,230
defined as at the moment being very

346
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:18,300
vigorous very very vigorous and dynamic

347
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,309
but at the same time not quite as

348
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,569
coherent as I think it's going to be and

349
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:24,990
going to have to be over the coming

350
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,009
years and I think it's also unequal and

351
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,750
what I mean by that and perhaps we'll

352
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:30,649
come back to it is that in the private

353
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:33,300
sector there is just masses of activity

354
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:34,949
contribution initiative masses of it we

355
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,240
could go through lists and lists of

356
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:38,250
things that are coming out of the

357
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,740
private sector there's clearly a lot of

358
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,059
activity at the government level indeed

359
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,100
part of that is engaging with the

360
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:47,069
private sector there's a lot going on in

361
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,079
civic society masses going on but I

362
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:50,849
think as far as the general public are

363
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:53,790
concerned we're still at the point in

364
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,250
2019 where there's frankly not a great

365
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,279
deal of interest in all of this or an

366
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,459
awareness and activity so I think that

367
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,410
one dimension of the public aspect of

368
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,239
this discussion I think is is still

369
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,529
lacking and I think that we were talking

370
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,170
about this over lunch and I think that's

371
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,879
what needs to be educated upwards if you

372
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,670
like I think you think it also probably

373
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,379
needs a little bit of shock treatment to

374
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,309
get it up to a more useful level

375
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:19,309
treatment

376
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,240
well you know we see some signs of

377
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,530
progress when it comes to for example

378
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,090
information sharing or forming of of

379
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,060
best practices in circulating them

380
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:37,460
within the industry but what at least

381
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,489
from my personal perspective is is very

382
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,610
apparent is that nations and governments

383
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:49,580
are not equipped to actually provide

384
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:51,710
annalistic civilian strategy in terms of

385
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,750
cyberspace and and I'll give an example

386
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:55,910
as we all know cyberspace is a distinct

387
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,540
domain it requires you know dedicated

388
00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:02,449
resources unique immunology special

389
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,959
attention so it's part of it

390
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:09,200
Nations needs to decide where to place

391
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,600
the organizations that will devise

392
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,240
national strategies and actually

393
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,670
implement them on a daily basis so if a

394
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,920
nation for example place their you know

395
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:21,110
those organizations under their military

396
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,709
they will probably perceive cyberspace

397
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:28,100
or cyber threat as you know as a you

398
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,690
know a manifestation of warfare and will

399
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:33,970
act accordingly if they will place them

400
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,870
under the auspices of you know internal

401
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,130
security organizations or law

402
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:40,280
enforcement they will probably perceive

403
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:45,110
it as a demonstration of insurgency or

404
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:47,720
maybe terror and and viewing or you know

405
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,730
looking at cyberspace through that kind

406
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,150
of distorted lens is very problematic

407
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,320
only by you know actually delegating

408
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,300
responsibilities to civilian

409
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,870
organizations that are able to implement

410
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,780
more comprehensive strategy to apply of

411
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,609
a more comprehensive strategy that's the

412
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,310
only way to actually communicate in the

413
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,899
same language with those civilian

414
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,899
organization with the private sector so

415
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:14,720
I think that's that the you know the

416
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,260
approach towards PPP's do private public

417
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,170
partnerships are only a symptom of a foe

418
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,300
of a wider philosophy toward cyberspace

419
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,199
I think that's a very important premise

420
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:31,990
to put to put here Greg you want to add

421
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:34,300
so I think it varies by each country

422
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:38,710
I think in the developed countries we

423
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:41,260
tend to see that they've passed laws put

424
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,050
in regulations in place established

425
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:47,590
cybersecurity risk management frameworks

426
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:49,810
and there's more collaboration between

427
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,389
the private sector and the government

428
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:55,720
agencies in the United States for

429
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,700
example for I'd say almost 20 years now

430
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,600
there's been a very close partnership

431
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:03,040
between the private sector and all of

432
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,300
the government agencies both the

433
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,340
civilian the military and the

434
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,250
intelligence and there's a great deal of

435
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,250
collaboration cooperation would all they

436
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,510
even call staff augmentation where the

437
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,940
government can't always get the

438
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:18,310
resources that it needs by its own

439
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,310
employees so its supplements by

440
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:23,620
providing private contractors to come in

441
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:26,950
and provide services in a wide variety

442
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,560
of cybersecurity skill areas but again

443
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:32,260
as I travel around the world I see that

444
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,149
it varies quite significantly like in

445
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,400
Israel for example they've established

446
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,400
in the last couple of years a national

447
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,950
cybersecurity Authority and the

448
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,610
director-general of that came out of the

449
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,640
military but he was really designed set

450
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:51,879
up a capability to oversee the

451
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,760
commercial sector and to oversee the

452
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,430
government civilian agencies to help

453
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,460
facilitate best practices from the

454
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,550
military and intelligence complex into

455
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,750
the commercial sector and so I think

456
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,149
some of the things that the Israelis are

457
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:10,180
doing in that area is very leading edge

458
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:12,760
I mean recently in Australia we've seen

459
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:16,240
new cyber security laws come out in

460
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:19,930
China some are more towards data privacy

461
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,110
some are more about security obviously

462
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:24,700
the EU with their general data

463
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:28,510
protection regulation is looking for

464
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,940
greater involvement on data security and

465
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,580
data privacy and collaboration so I

466
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,080
think there's a lot of positive steps

467
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,350
but I think it does vary significantly

468
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,020
by country and sort of their level of

469
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,850
maturity around the cyber space okay I

470
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,759
want to come back to Europe and

471
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,809
their legislation on privacy in a second

472
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,700
because I think it's very important

473
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,990
because it shapes the conversation that

474
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,600
we might have about whether or not

475
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:55,269
government where they overreach in

476
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,980
partnerships whether or not government

477
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:58,090
initiatives have a thwarting effect or

478
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,200
whether they have an accelerating effect

479
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,970
but first I want to come back to you

480
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,169
Paul because a moment ago you said that

481
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,029
really what the public needs is

482
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:06,039
something like shock treatment to

483
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:10,269
understand the importance of this issue

484
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:13,509
what a shock treatment look like I mean

485
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:15,970
is to say that I think we need to

486
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,159
consider certain actions and I thinking

487
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,179
really in terms of behavioral economics

488
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,039
and all that kind of stuff and this is a

489
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:23,320
debate that's been rolling along in the

490
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,149
UK for quite some time and I guess in in

491
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,289
many other countries and it's to say for

492
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:28,449
example if you're in the retail banking

493
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:30,610
sector and we all know perfectly well

494
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,659
that skimming frauds all these things

495
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,629
are happening all the time largely

496
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:36,639
because of unprotected computers going

497
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:37,959
online for online banking and so what

498
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:40,149
the retail banks have been trying to

499
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,210
have been gently you know cautiously

500
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:44,979
thinking about is how much of the loss

501
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:48,940
can be attributed to the individual

502
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,529
customers idiocy which is what of course

503
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,059
they quite like to do not least because

504
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:53,559
they don't want to bear the entire cost

505
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:55,899
but because they would also like to

506
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,700
ensure that their banking system is as

507
00:20:55,899 --> 00:20:59,500
tight as possible so that's what I mean

508
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,490
by by the shock treatment just

509
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,740
transferring a bit of the of the onus of

510
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,149
responsibility to the user and of course

511
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,789
the problem though in the banking sector

512
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:12,399
as in all countries I guess is that the

513
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:14,169
first bank to do this is is pretty

514
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:18,008
worried about customer loss or customer

515
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:21,519
flight but who's gonna go first you know

516
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:22,690
and that's the idiot bank yeah we're

517
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,789
still stuck in that but I think it's

518
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,289
worth thinking about it's worth

519
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:28,210
considering how we can take this sort of

520
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:30,580
initiative forward and that's what I

521
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,559
mean by shock so a gentle social yeah

522
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,519
it's a really good point in the United

523
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,899
States we have this big thing called the

524
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:36,370
national vulnerabilities database this

525
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:37,809
is really the most important thing in

526
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,090
many ways that the US government does

527
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:42,279
its run by about like two guys and it's

528
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,289
just a very up-to-date basically a

529
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:45,370
spreadsheet that says all of the new

530
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:47,980
vulnerabilities that have been found

531
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,570
recently that you can protect against

532
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:53,139
and the vast majority of cyber attacks

533
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,760
that hit really any system are already

534
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:56,560
disclosed to the public on that

535
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,930
vulnerabilities database like the

536
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,669
it's not just zero days it's not exotic

537
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:02,590
wizards you know shooting ones and

538
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,890
zeroes at the Infinity it's things that

539
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,110
people already know exist so along the

540
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,870
lines of shock treatment if there was

541
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:12,129
regulation in the United States or in

542
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:15,070
other countries and it's hard of course

543
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:16,890
to draw a monolithic picture of all of

544
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:20,080
them but if there was legislation that

545
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:23,140
essentially penalized not being fully

546
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,720
up-to-date on vulnerabilities that have

547
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,210
been disclosed that sort of thing is

548
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,330
that something that could be helpful

549
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,680
Greg is that the sort of thing that from

550
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,689
a company perspective they might then

551
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,870
ask well who's gonna pay for us to keep

552
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,730
up with this and and isn't that going to

553
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,290
create a lot of burden especially for

554
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,500
companies that aren't fortune 500

555
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:46,720
companies so where do we going forward

556
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,840
in terms of legislation punishing the

557
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,940
stupid punishing the incompetent and on

558
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,560
a corporate level where do we start with

559
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,780
that I'll start with you because you

560
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,310
were nodding a little bit well I do

561
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,600
because I think one of the sort of

562
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:01,149
bigger questions here is where does

563
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,669
accountability come from and I I think

564
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,880
to just start suggesting that you know

565
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,830
people are stupid or naive and and that

566
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,510
those are the biggest challenges I think

567
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:12,490
is kind of turning it upside down

568
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,379
because with big power and a lot of

569
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,390
these companies but also States still

570
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,970
have a lot of power should come big

571
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,940
responsibility and I indeed agree that

572
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,980
negligence or reputation saving for that

573
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,510
matter you know if there is a known

574
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,550
vulnerability but if it would cost

575
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,260
reputation for a software company or

576
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:31,840
bank to say to their customers look

577
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,180
we've been breached we've we've been

578
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,340
attacked through vulnerability you now

579
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,100
have to take step a B and C that also

580
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,560
discloses the sort of absolute

581
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,030
vulnerability of the product right so I

582
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,520
think there's often a tension between

583
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,560
what is the public interest and also

584
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,270
sharing information for example between

585
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,820
the private sector and the government so

586
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:54,340
that the proper steps can be taken those

587
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,889
incentives have to be increased and that

588
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,629
is by on the one hand preventing the

589
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:01,530
worst possible outcomes so I've worked

590
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:04,900
on for example mapping the steps taken

591
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:07,860
for vulnerability disclosure and and

592
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,340
stockpiling or or dealing with

593
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,240
vulnerabilities on the part of

594
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,919
governments

595
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,510
- look what is the state of play in

596
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,040
Europe and there are massive differences

597
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,370
between member states some member states

598
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,290
have sophisticated protocols and very

599
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,059
transparent mechanisms for the private

600
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:24,070
sector for their own behavior other

601
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:25,809
states have not done anything hmm

602
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:30,159
so to at least bring the minimum level

603
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:31,570
of prevention up to say as government's

604
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,490
were only gonna do what we think is

605
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,260
minimally minimally necessary of

606
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,910
corporations we're gonna ask that they

607
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,100
take certain steps and only when you

608
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,600
have a norm you can assess whether the

609
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,820
norm is violated and therefore whether

610
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,010
there should be consequences what what I

611
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,010
see now is that in a number of areas

612
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,660
there's not yet such a norm therefore

613
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:52,330
there's a lack of accountability and I

614
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:55,150
cannot blame individuals if they see

615
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:59,889
massive hacks or breaches taking place

616
00:24:55,150 --> 00:25:03,010
with zero consequences no fines no

617
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:05,320
people going to prison no attribution no

618
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:08,140
one held to account that they don't feel

619
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,990
empowered to do something themselves so

620
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,010
we have to really raise the bar of

621
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,630
prevention protection and and

622
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,730
accountability and I think that can be

623
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,630
quite ruthless because if out of some

624
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,220
kind of you know private or reputation

625
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:23,620
consideration there is not enough

626
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,990
investment in cyber security while the

627
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,330
tasks of providing cyber security or

628
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:31,870
dealing with the data of hundreds of

629
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,970
millions of people is taken on it has to

630
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:35,620
come with minimum threshold when I want

631
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,270
to get Greg's reaction to too ruthless

632
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,379
because I bet that there is one but

633
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,850
first you mentioned that there are a

634
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:42,520
couple of different places in Europe and

635
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,719
there's wide diversity among the way

636
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,639
different countries are tackling this

637
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,880
can you name one or two that's tackling

638
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,670
it particularly well yes the Netherlands

639
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,070
and France okay there you go all right

640
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:57,700
so ruthless what do you think your favor

641
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:59,669
of ruthless approach to corporate

642
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,330
hygiene and vulnerability disclosure or

643
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:03,580
what else is needed

644
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:06,010
you think so I you know I look at the

645
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:10,000
United States market for example which

646
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:13,540
is a huge market place each of the major

647
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,390
sectors industrial sectors have today

648
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,428
very specific cyber security risk

649
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,860
management frameworks and some actually

650
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:24,070
already have to your point public laws

651
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:26,080
and mandatory regulations around and I

652
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,480
do want to make a differentiation

653
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,939
because you use the term disclosure of

654
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,570
vulnerabilities that's at a much lower

655
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:37,680
level what most government agencies are

656
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,870
asking for today and regulators is

657
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,950
disclosure after a breach okay and

658
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,469
there's a big difference because

659
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,690
candidly every organization has

660
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,760
vulnerabilities okay that need to be

661
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:50,920
managed because the technology is

662
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,629
constantly evolving there's a big

663
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,460
difference between a vulnerability and

664
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,250
an actual breach that has significant

665
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,200
impact and so for example in the United

666
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:02,710
States the Department of Defense since

667
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,950
December 31st of 1997 is required that

668
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,750
every government contractor especially

669
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,790
in the Department of Defense and all of

670
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,010
their supply chain if they're dealing

671
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:14,290
with the the DoD that they have an

672
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:15,580
independent assessment against the

673
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,170
National Institute of Standards and

674
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,710
Technology it's called NIST

675
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:23,380
800 171 specific requirements and there

676
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:26,290
are penalties for non-compliance but

677
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:29,980
again it's an within reporting a breach

678
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:33,310
within 48 hours and there's a list of

679
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,750
over a hundred and thirty individual and

680
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,879
what's called information security

681
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,250
controls that have to be in place and

682
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,770
those government contractors have to be

683
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,720
audited against and let me give you one

684
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:45,370
other for example also in the United

685
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,640
States our healthcare industry which

686
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:50,949
again is privatized and is enormous in

687
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,710
terms of number of hospitals and health

688
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,570
care facilities has a public law that

689
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:57,520
was passed by the Obama administration

690
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:00,159
refer to as HIPAA the Health Insurance

691
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,670
Portability and Accountability Act which

692
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,490
requires that all organizations have

693
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,590
well established cybersecurity policies

694
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,420
plans and procedures that they have

695
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,909
designated a chief information security

696
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,700
officer that they conduct at least on an

697
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:18,280
annual basis vulnerability assessments

698
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,470
but it does not require that those

699
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,889
vulnerability assessments be publicly

700
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:25,360
disclosed only that if they have a

701
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,850
significant breach that that information

702
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,909
be shared and reported to try to help

703
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:33,129
again mitigate the potential impacts on

704
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:35,230
other organizations so I just want to

705
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:38,169
clarify sure I think there should be

706
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,119
reporting of breaches I don't think

707
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:42,279
should be asked to report on all their

708
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,418
vulnerabilities okay I almost chime in

709
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:45,940
on this and then I think we have a

710
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:47,799
counterpoint sure so uh I just wanted to

711
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,859
take a broader you know to provide a

712
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:53,019
broader perspective you know III believe

713
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:55,809
that regulation is imperative I believe

714
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:59,379
that in some cases maybe fines are also

715
00:28:55,809 --> 00:29:03,580
imperative but I think that you in many

716
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:06,609
cases coercion is not the best possible

717
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,629
solution for the problems in hand and

718
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:10,689
I'll give you an example I think it

719
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:13,480
starts from understanding the landscape

720
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:15,820
right so for example there are some

721
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:20,369
private organizations that would

722
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:23,168
probably benefit from if you'll apply a

723
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:25,480
voluntary approach towards them so

724
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:28,379
enable them to cop write on a voluntary

725
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,879
basis with a national search or C cert

726
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:31,988
that's the way you can actually engage

727
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:34,359
with them that's the way that they

728
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:36,869
actually get a sense of control over the

729
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:41,649
process that way you can maybe boost

730
00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:43,269
information sharing and other measures

731
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:45,518
that could be relevant for those

732
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:47,259
organizations robustness and resilience

733
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,369
but in the same time there are other

734
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:50,529
organizations there are some

735
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:53,168
organizations that might benefit from

736
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:55,269
you know more sector specific regulation

737
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:56,679
because that way if you have sector

738
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:58,539
specific regulation or even sector

739
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,230
specific entities that work on those

740
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:03,669
topics there is common language

741
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:06,340
understanding of their day-to-day

742
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:08,289
operations so that way

743
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,928
the government and the private sector

744
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:12,730
could communicate better and of course

745
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:15,039
there are critical infrastructures where

746
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,480
because the risk could buff off of

747
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,059
damaging those infrastructure could be

748
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,169
so devastating and that the government

749
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:25,539
needs to take a more heavy-handed

750
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:27,220
approach and actually regulate regulate

751
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:30,249
much more closely d'oeuvres organization

752
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:32,919
because of the potential impact of or

753
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:34,539
the cascading effect of damaging one of

754
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:37,779
those infrastructures so I think it's

755
00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:40,809
it's all revolves around how do you

756
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:45,279
define your the subject matter how do

757
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:46,960
you define the relevant private sector

758
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:51,940
entity that you are trying to work with

759
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,070
okay you had a comment related to that

760
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:57,430
I did but it was more about the earlier

761
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,830
part about you know the disclosure only

762
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,570
applying to a known breach because I

763
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,740
think there's also still the question of

764
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:08,320
negligence if you are building crappy

765
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,900
products or software then I think there

766
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,879
has to also be a spotlight on that and

767
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,100
this all boils down to the question of

768
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,050
who pays the price not only of an attack

769
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,600
but also of the costs of an attack or

770
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,210
the costs of negligence or even the cost

771
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:27,189
of outdated software I mean what we

772
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:28,780
learned after want to cry was that there

773
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,910
was a lot of outdated software being

774
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,620
used by those public institutions and

775
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:35,320
that they basically did not have the

776
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,179
means right to update the software to a

777
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,310
level that is needed with today's

778
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,830
vulnerabilities in you know attack land

779
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:44,050
so the question is then who is

780
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:47,980
responsible for this right well

781
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:51,010
companies say well we offered an update

782
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,750
but it costs X and hospitals public

783
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:54,760
hospitals we're not willing to pay it

784
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:58,150
public hospitals say we have to choose

785
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,310
between you know emergency rooms or

786
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,830
updating our basic software it's not a

787
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:04,750
priority for us so the the sort of

788
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,580
broader scale management of how to

789
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,410
ensure that not only today but also

790
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,090
going forward in and out of things as we

791
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,870
mentioned super important if you don't

792
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,919
put in minimum requirements and also

793
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:19,209
scenario planning of what will happen

794
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:21,880
once exponentially more potentially

795
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,800
outdated or vulnerable devices are in

796
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,990
the hands of more citizens without the

797
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,270
proper knowledge of the vulnerabilities

798
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,220
where does it lead us because clearly

799
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,650
already our Western societies or more

800
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,330
developed societies are at more risk of

801
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,760
being attacked because more people are

802
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,590
connected yeah so we have to I think

803
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,270
connect the dots a bit and really look

804
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,679
at how these change-of-command chains

805
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,790
have responsibility and of

806
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,200
accountability look okay there's a ton

807
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,420
in that that we definitely could spend

808
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,730
some time unpacking in terms of whether

809
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:54,760
or not a company that the NSA developed

810
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,860
an exploit towards is a crappy company

811
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,790
because the NSA hacked them is like I

812
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,219
think it's a matter of sort of

813
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:03,190
subjective opinion but that's every

814
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,330
company so turn aside over here because

815
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,740
we've got a lot of questions coming in

816
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,960
is there any way to measure

817
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,789
in dollars damage done by cyberattacks

818
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,169
or intellectual property theft eg China

819
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:13,270
is there already a cyber insurance

820
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:15,789
there's already a couple of examples of

821
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,899
a cyber insurance where is that what are

822
00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:20,309
the ones that are successful and what

823
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:20,309
are the ones that provide a model I

824
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,279
think a successful would be in the eyes

825
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,710
of the individual company after they've

826
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,690
been breached and if they feel like

827
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,570
they've been properly compensated I

828
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,779
would say in in most cases in my

829
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,010
experience when I've been engaged by

830
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:41,529
private companies and they've been

831
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,820
breached they need help putting together

832
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:47,200
a shot cyber liability insurance claim

833
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,649
that the insurance companies are often

834
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,750
hesitant to pay out for all the damages

835
00:33:50,649 --> 00:33:55,989
associated with it both from the

836
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:59,799
hardware software the actual recovery

837
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:02,320
and not only the eradication of the

838
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:04,120
malware but potentially the replacement

839
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,520
as well as the education and training of

840
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:10,299
the workforce may need to go into place

841
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:13,599
so I think there's a lot of issues of

842
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:16,389
concern around the insurance industry

843
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,599
and around how they're evaluating the

844
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:21,460
cost of cyber liability insurance the

845
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,379
coverage that's actually provided and

846
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:27,280
more recently there's been some

847
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:29,679
significant law legal cases that are

848
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,909
still in dispute I'll say they're still

849
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,220
in litigation where companies have been

850
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:38,639
attacked and though it was disclosed

851
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:41,080
that those attacks were sponsored by

852
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,770
nation-states and the insurance

853
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:47,379
companies then claimed that they would

854
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,770
not be held liable under a force majeure

855
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:54,069
clause because it was essentially an act

856
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,690
of war and if it's an act of war they're

857
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:59,290
precluded from having to make a payout

858
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:02,080
and so we've got now legal cases where

859
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,970
major corporations are suing their

860
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,009
insurance companies because even though

861
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,990
they're paying millions of dollars for

862
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,730
their cyber liability insurance company

863
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,640
there's no question they've been

864
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,770
breached the question is now should they

865
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,180
be held liable because of the nature of

866
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,589
the attack oh yeah

867
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,578
just to interject very quickly I mean I

868
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:23,670
think we're talking about Zurich

869
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,349
insurance and yeah petia and and the act

870
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,450
of war which I mean it seems to me as an

871
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:30,630
extraordinary moment that we've arrived

872
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,980
that when a and the insurance company

873
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,180
part of the finance sector is telling

874
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:38,880
the rest of the world what war is and

875
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:41,279
isn't interesting moment I think I think

876
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,109
I've been looking at this for many years

877
00:35:41,279 --> 00:35:46,109
I'm not a tech person but from the

878
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:47,730
security policy as a perspective for

879
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:50,098
about 18 or 19 years and their last 10

880
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:51,390
years or so I've been seeing more and

881
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,160
more interest in involvement from

882
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,839
insurance and reinsurance interestingly

883
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,149
and very importantly as the kind of

884
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:03,089
backstop I'm a British shouldn't use the

885
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:04,890
word backstop should I so I think I

886
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:06,930
think it's certainly moving in moving

887
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,038
fast but I in my understanding if

888
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,509
there's not someone here from insurance

889
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,069
it'd be great to hear from you my

890
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:15,029
understanding is it's still very slow

891
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:16,829
very cautious and that the the currency

892
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:19,289
amount of risk that's underwritten the

893
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:21,869
cyber risk that's underwritten is minut

894
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:24,270
compared to what the actual market is at

895
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:26,910
the moment so we're still in we're still

896
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,410
in in transition I I guess and I can I

897
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:31,230
can kind of understand that caution

898
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:33,058
because you know the measurement of risk

899
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:35,460
and harm and so on in cyberspace is

900
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:36,960
still in its infancy so as I was saying

901
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,279
over lunch this is somewhere what we

902
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,630
need to be doing some more work on

903
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,520
mmm-hmm

904
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,809
so when I change gears real quick over

905
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,069
here there's a if you're interested in

906
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:47,579
this subject there's a very good paper

907
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:50,579
up in 2017 from Anisha that looks at

908
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:51,660
public-private partnerships and what's

909
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,490
great about it is that they're they

910
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,259
break it down in terms of the different

911
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,569
sort of types of governmental bodies

912
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,309
that create these partnerships with

913
00:36:57,569 --> 00:37:02,700
private institutions and by their

914
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:04,650
figures from 2017 public private service

915
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,960
operators are about 70 percent law

916
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,670
enforcement is 12 percent and national

917
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,279
intelligence agencies are about 7

918
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:14,160
percent so as an American I look at that

919
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:15,480
and I immediately think well what are

920
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,680
the privacy implications of

921
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,089
public-private partnerships in the

922
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,259
future and how do you navigate creating

923
00:37:21,089 --> 00:37:24,509
better partnerships while at the same

924
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,650
time paying attention to the public need

925
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:30,029
for privacy protections from some of

926
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,830
these companies that have this stuff so

927
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:33,480
can give us a sense of what

928
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,040
future legislation in that area

929
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,900
potentially looks like or what it should

930
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,440
look like from your perspective or what

931
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:43,410
you're afraid of

932
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:45,030
go ahead anybody jump all reach' this is

933
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,950
indeed one of the aspects of the

934
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,780
question how is the public interest

935
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,669
protected and obviously one of the main

936
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:53,580
fundamental differences between the EU

937
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:56,460
and the u.s. is that in the EU

938
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:59,100
privacy is a right so it's a very

939
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,080
different kind of requirement also to

940
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,089
protect our rights than to see it only

941
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,840
and let's say consumer context or

942
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,170
something like that

943
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:09,890
mm-hmm so the general data protection

944
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,150
regulation one of the most known

945
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:15,540
products of EU law making by now I

946
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:18,330
believe is is one effort to try to

947
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,580
create clarity visa vie the private

948
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:22,140
sector and governments in how data

949
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,799
should be treated and to empower

950
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,210
individuals to for example take data to

951
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,090
make it more portable if they want to

952
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,010
switch services but also to have minimum

953
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,720
requirements to have requirements about

954
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,140
what to do when there is a breach so I

955
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,779
think we will see more of this kind of

956
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:42,290
legislation which is is aimed at

957
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,850
protecting the rights of people but also

958
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:47,460
making sure that the companies that are

959
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,970
so powerful in this space are at least

960
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:52,370
respecting minimum requirements like

961
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:54,120
antitrust and fair competition or

962
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:56,420
non-discrimination when it comes to the

963
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,009
use of algorithms I mean there's a whole

964
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,290
spectrum of issues that have still not

965
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,390
been clearly articulated but if you ask

966
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,490
me what I think will happen and should

967
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,589
happen is that the rights will be the

968
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:10,740
sort of anchor from which there will be

969
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:12,660
an attempt to enforce and to assess

970
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,919
whether whether the behavior of

971
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,560
companies even if they're at the other

972
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,940
end of the world complies yeah and I

973
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,509
also believe that that's the best way to

974
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:23,490
go not to regulate technology by

975
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:26,280
technology because it's way too slow and

976
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:28,229
it's way too fragmented you should focus

977
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,960
on the principles that need protection

978
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,340
and then empower in an ideal world the

979
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,950
regulators to assess whether that

980
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:37,470
happens and if not you know what the

981
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:39,660
consequences should be okay

982
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,970
so I I mean I have some concerns there

983
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,830
right because you're also potentially

984
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:45,730
talking about a regulation that might

985
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,250
harm the ability of intelligence age

986
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,570
Caeser law enforcement to carry out

987
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,970
their duties and while there's very

988
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:53,290
clear sense of european rights on a

989
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,669
national level and on a local level

990
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:56,650
there's also a very clear sense of what

991
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,580
is the mandate of law enforcement so do

992
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:02,109
you see any conflict potentially there I

993
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,850
don't know exactly what you have in mind

994
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,920
but I think it is perfectly normal in a

995
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,720
democracy to have law enforcement and

996
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,030
intelligence services bound by

997
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:13,299
restrictions right and to have oversight

998
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:15,880
and to not have unlimited powers and

999
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,920
abilities and I think generally we are

1000
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,290
quite behind in regulating a lot of the

1001
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,560
tech sector I know few sectors that are

1002
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:28,210
so powerful and so on or under regulated

1003
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:30,070
and so I would suggest that we focus

1004
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:31,840
first on the bulk which is making sure

1005
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:34,270
that there is non-discrimination that

1006
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,310
the rule of law applies online and then

1007
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,290
the specific needs of the intelligence

1008
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:41,049
service are or probably a niche of that

1009
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:45,310
discussion it should not lead measures

1010
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:47,650
as such oftentimes I think even though I

1011
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:50,109
wish it wasn't so intelligent services

1012
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,750
will do what they need to do even if it

1013
00:40:50,109 --> 00:40:54,730
means bending the law if not breaking

1014
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:56,980
the law okay well let me turn the dial

1015
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:58,330
because you are a start-up I mean you

1016
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,130
were running a startup and you're

1017
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,400
looking at a potential future of

1018
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,390
creating a company that must deal with

1019
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,500
regulation that will exist in the future

1020
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,819
you also have some experience in

1021
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,619
intelligence that I asked him about you

1022
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,590
can't tell me about so do you is it your

1023
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:13,510
opinion that there is an insufficient

1024
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:17,260
amount of regulation of the tech

1025
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:19,660
industry right now or also what sort of

1026
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:22,240
regulation might occur that would be

1027
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,740
really bad for a start-up and what would

1028
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,979
be okay that's in line with these

1029
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,569
privacy questions all right so first of

1030
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,109
all I believe that any regulation that

1031
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:33,850
deals that tries to first of all strike

1032
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:38,710
a very delicate balance between you know

1033
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:40,660
privacy and and and security and any

1034
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:44,490
regulation deals with you know that

1035
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:47,350
tries to enhance security whilst not

1036
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:52,350
impairing loss or stifling innovation

1037
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:55,089
needs to create or evolve through a

1038
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:58,270
continuous discussion with the private

1039
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:59,730
sector it couldn't it should not be

1040
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,800
imposed

1041
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:05,610
unilaterally so I think that only by

1042
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:08,070
incorporating corporations private

1043
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:11,340
private sectors perspective can can

1044
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:13,890
regulation could be really viable and

1045
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:20,400
valuable for for for entire countries

1046
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:22,140
and for the the private sector now I I

1047
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,710
think I completely agree with with the

1048
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:30,319
statement or with the assertion that

1049
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:33,840
that regulation usually lags behind

1050
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:35,310
behind that regulation legs behind

1051
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,130
security and security usually lags

1052
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:40,460
behind in technology and you know if you

1053
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:43,800
look at most of the companies out there

1054
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:46,950
usually their approach towards security

1055
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,610
is derived either through either from

1056
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:51,990
the regulatory landscape or through the

1057
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:56,690
perspective of their customers and

1058
00:42:51,990 --> 00:43:00,569
customers will always will always prefer

1059
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:03,000
usability over security and in in that

1060
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,250
context I think that you know certain

1061
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,830
requirements regulation specific domains

1062
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,060
are essential but again as I said you

1063
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,819
need to strike a very delicate balance

1064
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:14,310
you don't want to impaired innovation

1065
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:20,400
you need to sometimes break things in

1066
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:22,170
order to to to promote cooperation in

1067
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,210
order to promote innovation within the

1068
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:27,420
industry so I do believe that a cautious

1069
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:29,720
policy cautious no governments need to

1070
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,100
tread very lightly especially in this

1071
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,419
space that is ever-evolving

1072
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,310
and ever-changing that that's my

1073
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,080
perspective okay yeah so we have some

1074
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:38,790
new questions from slider and again feel

1075
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:41,759
free to send these in because we only

1076
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:44,130
have about 10 minutes left you the top

1077
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,290
one our Apple devices mainly iOS and Mac

1078
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,510
iOS devices more secure and more

1079
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:51,080
resistant against vulnerabilities than

1080
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:54,090
devices working on Android and Windows

1081
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:55,650
that I think that we briefly had someone

1082
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,850
in the audience that was from Microsoft

1083
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:58,890
and I think that they will say that

1084
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:01,440
Microsoft devices are just great but if

1085
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:07,440
you guys have a opinion on that I'd love

1086
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,940
to hear it anyone a new sort of depends

1087
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,230
on the size of the attack surface the

1088
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,190
more software you put out then the more

1089
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,359
vulnerabilities you're just going to

1090
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,270
have if vegans just sort of like an

1091
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:15,400
issue of scale

1092
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,920
at this point I mean I'll just share a

1093
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,740
general observation I'd say over the

1094
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,400
last five years we've seen a significant

1095
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:26,259
improvement in the cybersecurity

1096
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,510
associated with those major operating

1097
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:29,890
systems and their platforms I think it's

1098
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,320
fair to say that we've seen a

1099
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,660
significant improvement around cyber

1100
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,930
security as it relates to cloud

1101
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,790
migration and cloud adoption I would

1102
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:42,490
suggest to you that again the weakest

1103
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:45,220
links are not usually within those

1104
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,740
world-class providers of software and

1105
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,649
systems but rather the endpoints and the

1106
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:52,450
connections to those databases that's

1107
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,760
where the real liabilities and

1108
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:57,339
vulnerabilities occur mm-hmm not to say

1109
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,530
that inherently there aren't some bugs

1110
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:02,500
associated with all software platforms

1111
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:06,160
and operating systems but again to the

1112
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:08,080
earlier point the largest attacks that

1113
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,819
have been done on a multi national basis

1114
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,040
where there was pet yeah want to cry

1115
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,050
the Equifax in the United States that

1116
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:17,190
really impacted just hundreds of

1117
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:21,130
millions of people all over the world

1118
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:23,530
were those in in systems like Cisco and

1119
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,750
Microsoft where there were known

1120
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:27,640
vulnerabilities and there were patches

1121
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,970
that were deployed that could have been

1122
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:34,299
utilized but for a variety of reasons

1123
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:37,600
some cost related some simply they just

1124
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,430
didn't do it okay they chose not to do

1125
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,279
it because to your point they're often

1126
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:44,350
care more about capacity and operational

1127
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,900
usability and uptime than they do

1128
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:48,900
security and so you know the thought I'd

1129
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:52,410
like to leave the audience with is that

1130
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:57,250
there is an inherent difference between

1131
00:45:52,410 --> 00:46:00,549
regulation enforcement compliance and

1132
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:03,940
actual security okay because you can

1133
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:07,870
have regulation and people not comply

1134
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:11,200
you can have people comply but still not

1135
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:14,200
really have adequate security and so if

1136
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,870
the point is just to regulate without

1137
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,460
the idea that you're really creating

1138
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:21,220
security then it's creating a false

1139
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:25,600
expectation it's adding costs and it's

1140
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:27,730
not adding value I just just very

1141
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,620
quickly I

1142
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,630
there is a reason why there is such

1143
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:35,160
emphasis in the cybersecurity industry

1144
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:38,770
on automation sometimes companies

1145
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:41,109
organizations are not probabl properly

1146
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,270
protected not because they're reluctant

1147
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:45,130
to implement regulation it's just really

1148
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,600
really hard on a large scale

1149
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:49,420
so the OL issue of orchestration

1150
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:51,600
automation is big right now it's going

1151
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:55,000
to get even bigger in the near future ok

1152
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,900
very good question Lindsey Gorman I like

1153
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,430
this laughs because I was following this

1154
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,380
story as well a recent NPR story

1155
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:01,839
detailed the gross underreporting of IP

1156
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,550
theft from Chinese government hacks US

1157
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,350
companies refused to come forward for

1158
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:07,480
fear of jeopardizing business in China

1159
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:09,130
and because being hacked isn't a good

1160
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:11,830
luck to shareholders how do we address

1161
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:16,420
this 557 billion dollar a year impact on

1162
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:18,090
US economy yeah what is the future of on

1163
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,230
one hand trying to gain greater

1164
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,790
advantage in the Chinese market and be

1165
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,980
first to market in China and at the same

1166
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,140
time dealing with as you pointed out the

1167
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,790
largest perpetrator of cyber hacks in

1168
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,440
the world like how how do those things

1169
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,520
buts the fiction in the future and how

1170
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,510
do you navigate it through

1171
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:36,100
public-private partnerships anybody

1172
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:37,360
maybe public-private partnerships aside

1173
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,370
for a moment because I think there is

1174
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,950
often a conflicting interest between the

1175
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:45,009
private sector which has a bit of a gold

1176
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,839
rush when it comes to China while also

1177
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:53,250
facing a lot of downsides whether it's

1178
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:56,910
IP theft or forced data localization or

1179
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:59,860
joint ventures that are required or

1180
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:01,450
communist cells sitting in companies I

1181
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:04,300
mean I don't know if you've ever seen

1182
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,439
but it's a fairly bizarre phenomenon so

1183
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:07,900
there's a number of complaints

1184
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,430
discriminatory actions taken concerns

1185
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:13,300
that companies have and they rightfully

1186
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:17,680
expect politicians like myself I work on

1187
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:19,720
trade to address these issues but if on

1188
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,460
the one hand those companies are not

1189
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,350
changing their behavior for a moment

1190
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:26,500
they're just rushing to go to China and

1191
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:28,839
you know expect politicians to solve the

1192
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,970
issues then all the Chinese have to do

1193
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,010
is sit and wait and that's kind of the

1194
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:35,169
approach that you sense when you address

1195
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,720
these issues is that the politicians are

1196
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:39,610
the ones quote-unquote complaining they

1197
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,629
come with a list of demands and the

1198
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,520
private sector some

1199
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:44,860
times helped by national politicians or

1200
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:46,660
members of royal houses or whatnot go on

1201
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,300
trade missions and they come to bring

1202
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:52,060
contracts or to to close contracts this

1203
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:53,530
tension needs to be bridged so in the

1204
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,540
u.s. now there's a lot of attention on

1205
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:57,820
China it kind of came rapidly as often

1206
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,710
it does in the u.s. in Europe there's

1207
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,840
more focus on China as well with an EU

1208
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:03,520
China strategy it is important to bring

1209
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,240
those two together so there should be

1210
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,910
more

1211
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,339
maybe not partnership but strategizing

1212
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:11,890
between the private sector and politics

1213
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,150
the public sector in terms of how to

1214
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:15,730
deal with China you know which

1215
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:17,950
technology technologies do not want to

1216
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:20,170
see bought or taken over

1217
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:21,609
what role does foreign direct investment

1218
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,260
play and how is it deployed

1219
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:25,780
strategically by a country like China

1220
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:28,120
but also many other countries so to

1221
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,670
connect the dots between trade concerns

1222
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,740
and economic concerns security concerns

1223
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,480
and strategic concerns but also very

1224
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:36,209
importantly I believe in often missing

1225
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,940
in the discussion human rights concerns

1226
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:41,680
because similarly to how because of gold

1227
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:44,400
rush companies are quiet about how

1228
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,810
they're mistreated

1229
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,680
unfortunately democracies are awfully

1230
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:52,450
quiet to address systemic structural and

1231
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,830
very fundamental human rights violations

1232
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,569
in a country like China because they

1233
00:49:53,830 --> 00:50:02,200
don't want to lose their opportunities

1234
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:03,970
on the Chinese market okay well you know

1235
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:05,470
it's a very complex problem and I

1236
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:07,660
thought you did a really nice job of

1237
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,359
summarizing all the issues that are

1238
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:13,540
integrated associated with it I'll say

1239
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:17,440
from a technology perspective it's very

1240
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:19,390
challenging you know we have major US

1241
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,090
corporations and other multinational

1242
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:24,339
corporations that we advise and we're

1243
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:26,290
trying to help them be compliant with

1244
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:29,110
the new cybersecurity law that's in

1245
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:31,060
place in China as well at the same time

1246
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,010
being compliant with the laws in their

1247
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,770
respective countries while at the same

1248
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:39,100
time trying to avoid getting their

1249
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:42,610
intellectual property stolen by the

1250
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:45,430
major communication companies in China

1251
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:48,430
which are actively doing that and so it

1252
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:51,069
is a very significant issue I will say

1253
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:53,980
there are technologies which I won't go

1254
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:56,650
into that are available in the

1255
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:59,560
social sector now for mobile phone

1256
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:01,300
security computer security levels of

1257
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:05,109
encryption that make it more difficult

1258
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:07,900
but it's not there's there's no panacea

1259
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:10,600
here and so we have to be very

1260
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:13,570
intelligent about how we do business in

1261
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:16,540
China who we do business with and what

1262
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:18,700
technology we bring and what data we

1263
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:23,890
bring to China I'll just put it that way

1264
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:26,169
okay so we are about a time and some

1265
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:29,080
folks have a thing to one run off to

1266
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:30,820
directly after this panel so I think the

1267
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,160
West Was might be here available for

1268
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,200
some chit chat for a little while but I

1269
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,790
want you to join me real quickly and

1270
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,580
taking our panel for talking today and

1271
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:45,750
so thank you so much

1272
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:45,750
[Applause]

1273
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,020
you
