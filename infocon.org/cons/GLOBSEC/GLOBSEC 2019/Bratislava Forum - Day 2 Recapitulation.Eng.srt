1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,798
the AI is faster but it's not actually

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,240
more intelligent and so what then ends

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,219
up happening is that we have dumber

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,309
decisions being made much more quickly

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,079
at a global scale and if we have to be a

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,900
global actor we have to be a regional

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:22,288
one we regret the brakes for many

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,990
reasons we are going to deliver the

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,289
brakes it if the UK still wants to leave

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,109
we can stay on our path if you want to

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,239
take us if you don't want us we should

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,020
take care of ourselves we all have

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,890
stakes in in stable Balkans we do see

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,930
our advancement as an investment in the

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:46,289
invest ability of the region the milder

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,640
male relationship that NATO has with

17
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,829
Turkey is is is strong in his thick as

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,110
it's been in the last decade the Arab

19
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,949
countries can be just as progressive

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,519
just as global in their outlook and just

21
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,789
as ambitious we need this time to take a

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,470
comprehensive approach and we can take

23
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,560
that approach because of the strong

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:13,650
engagement at the highest levels on all

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,140
sides companies have to focus far more

26
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,630
on politics than they used to in the

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,420
past countries don't trade with each

28
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,789
other individuals trade with each other

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,150
organizations companies trade with each

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,150
other
