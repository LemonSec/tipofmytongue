00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,430
our super panel I would like to

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,410
introduce we have a taraji former US

Jerusalem so mix of practitioners and

25
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:20,630
academics I would like to start with a

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:24,390
couple of headlines or numbers from last

27
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:27,570
last couple of days there is a Reuter

28
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,600
reported Moody's report about the with

29
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:34,979
the title US economy will lose pace this

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,639
year after peaking in 2018 new president

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,640
of World Bank has lamented deepening

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,159
slowdown in global trade World Bank

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,939
lowered its forecasts of global growth

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,860
for 2019 from 2.6 from 2.9 to 2.6

35
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:56,520
percent

36
00:01:51,860 --> 00:02:00,090
German German Institute for made a

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,340
survey which resulted in in the

38
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,189
globalization has reached limits of

39
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,259
acceptance among respective populations

40
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:10,859
in major industrialized economies

41
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,290
so and it's a stretch and German export

42
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,629
expectations are in decline in the long

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,519
term and there is a fresh news from this

44
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:20,970
this morning or this night that there

45
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:24,540
will be no US tariffs on Mexico but not

46
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:29,220
not the good numbers in the US about the

47
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,970
US jobs so picture seems to be quite

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,609
gloomy but I would be interested to know

49
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,630
at the beginning of each from each of

50
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,080
you if we have a reasons ten years after

51
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,760
the last big financial crisis if you

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,870
have a reasons for optimism or pessimism

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,298
maybe we can start with the like three

54
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,049
reasons for optimism and three reasons

55
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:58,849
for pessimism from each of you I will

56
00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:01,590
start with you for example good morning

57
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:04,738
well I had to start with reasons for

58
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:07,140
pessimism on a Saturday morning but I do

59
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,019
think that we're more vulnerable now

60
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,730
than we were 10 years ago and the

61
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:17,370
financial crisis happened ten years ago

62
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,369
we were we dug ourselves out of that

63
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,880
hole by utilizing low interest rates and

64
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:28,290
a balance sheet that was handed by the

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,920
Fed and the Treasury and today in this

66
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:35,760
environment we have even more divided

67
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,670
Congress and higher deficits and so I

68
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,040
think that we may not have access to the

69
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,339
same emergency measures that we had back

70
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,420
then

71
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,889
in dealing with another crisis not to

72
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,950
mention the fact that interest rates

73
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,769
couldn't be any lower so I guess as they

74
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,108
say in the economics profession it would

75
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:59,040
be pushing on a string right I did pay

76
00:03:55,109 --> 00:04:01,079
attention in that class I also think

77
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,798
there have been market and structural

78
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,930
changes over the last ten years again we

79
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,230
used low interest rates to spur economic

80
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,769
growth and for the last ten years and

81
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:17,190
that growth has masked some changes

82
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:20,310
fundamental changes that have occurred

83
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,370
for example climate change and its

84
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:26,730
impact on human population is being felt

85
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:31,190
more frequently and in greater levels

86
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:35,750
and the cost of financial cost of

87
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:39,719
hurricanes droughts tornadoes fires and

88
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:44,340
extreme weather events is will continue

89
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,230
to pose a drain to resources of

90
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,289
governments resources that could

91
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:53,700
otherwise be available to address

92
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:56,910
financial challenges so I think that the

93
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,610
combination of a more divided political

94
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,660
situation at least in the u.s. higher

95
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:06,170
deficits and less flexibility and

96
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,940
leverage on the part of governments

97
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,950
because of their lower resources in

98
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,440
being able to respond to the next crisis

99
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,909
those would be the reasons that I would

100
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,190
think that we're more vulnerable now

101
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,900
than we were 10 years ago and I'm going

102
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,300
to have to think about ten we know three

103
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,650
reasons for optimism so maybe I'll let

104
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,090
my colleagues thank you thank you I

105
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,419
forgot to mention that live so there's

106
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,979
always hope that's why I forgot to

107
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,900
mention that we have this nice

108
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,740
application slide also if you want to

109
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:41,219
propose the question please do that or

110
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,310
login with the globe SEC 2009 login and

111
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,380
and put a question there otherwise we

112
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,900
can then discuss in classic way as well

113
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,680
so please Linda three reasons for both

114
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,419
or for just pessimism I'd like to start

115
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,990
with the bad news first so let's do the

116
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:01,860
reasons for pessimism I think you know

117
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,230
as we've already heard global growth

118
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,600
probably peaked last year in advanced

119
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,640
economies and so we are in a cyclical

120
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,260
slowdown so you see that in terms of the

121
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,780
policy responses everywhere from the ECB

122
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,750
as well as Japan okay Japan's been

123
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,119
easing for a long time China and of

124
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,540
course the latest out of the United

125
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,669
States so in that sense it is part of

126
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,880
the business cycle but the problem the

127
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,820
pessimistic problem is in this part of

128
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,700
the business side

129
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,700
you don't want geopolitical tensions to

130
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:38,770
worsen the downturn so like I said

131
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,530
counter cyclical monetary policy has

132
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,469
already been in effect in a number of

133
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:47,409
economies to try to counteract as you

134
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,230
would normally expect the slowdown in

135
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,020
this part of the business cycle but if

136
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,540
you have the us-china trade tension and

137
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:58,359
you have a rise in protectionism because

138
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,850
of a backlash against globalization it's

139
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,790
really the wrong time to be putting more

140
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:08,970
frictions more cost more uncertainty

141
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:10,990
around the short-term economic picture

142
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:14,320
and I suppose another reason for

143
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:18,180
pessimism is that it's been 10 years

144
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:21,430
since the the last financial crisis and

145
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,170
one of the things the International

146
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,480
Monetary Fund and others are quite

147
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,730
concerned about is this buildup of debt

148
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,010
which is related to having had very low

149
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:34,300
interest rates in advanced economies

150
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:36,070
which means liquidity money is abundant

151
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,040
not just an advanced economy it's a lot

152
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,080
of it went into emerging markets so if

153
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,930
you never predict that they'll not be

154
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,669
another crisis because there will be so

155
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,990
you're sort of hitting the down part of

156
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:52,150
the cycle you're seeing probably quite a

157
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,390
lot of buildup of debt which is always a

158
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,299
precursor to crisis and quite a few

159
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,310
years since the last financial crisis so

160
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,590
if you just think back over crises right

161
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,470
so before 2008 we had the dot-com bubble

162
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:09,010
in 2000 2001 before that Asian financial

163
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,290
crisis or 1998 before that the global

164
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:14,289
recession early 1990s and then before

165
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:18,120
that the global recession in the early

166
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:20,530
1980s and then of course a number of

167
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,980
other crises in the middle the peso

168
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,049
crisis in the mid 90s I'm not even going

169
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,290
to go back to the 1970s because that was

170
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:32,409
a mess and so essentially we could be

171
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:34,240
looking at another debt field crisis and

172
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,030
then I suppose another third reason for

173
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,620
pessimism is whether or not there will

174
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:44,270
be enough coordination if necessary

175
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,750
globally not just within as your

176
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:49,850
they say the political system in the US

177
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:52,190
because of how interlinked markets are

178
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,430
today will there be the same type of g20

179
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:59,630
response that we saw ten years ago where

180
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:05,180
there was an absolute willingness to to

181
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:06,920
coordinate and certainly you know given

182
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,920
the tensions that we see now between

183
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,319
countries whether or not that's going to

184
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,839
be as easy to do I'm going to give you

185
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:20,750
quick reasons for optimism and then I

186
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:26,600
think the optimistic reasons are there

187
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:30,320
always business cycles so it's okay

188
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:35,210
they're always crisi I mean we've come

189
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:38,930
through it and over the medium term the

190
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:41,540
underlying strength in advanced

191
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,370
economies and emerging markets is

192
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,000
actually pretty considerable and it's

193
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:48,740
fueled by technology so just to give you

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,900
quickly a couple of examples so if as

195
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,210
the economy's obviously secular

196
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,970
stagnation this idea that over the

197
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,700
medium term we're all going to grow more

198
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,040
slowly it's because of an ageing society

199
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,870
and advanced economies although the

200
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:06,260
older I get the less I accept you're

201
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,810
less productive as you get older but

202
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,280
this you know this worried that somehow

203
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,560
we're all going to end up in a slow

204
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,079
growth world and yet you know where the

205
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,949
term secular stagnation comes from so

206
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,750
I've just written a book called the

207
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,210
great economist that looks over 250

208
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:23,900
years of economic history it was coined

209
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:27,140
in 1939 by Alvin Hansen who said oh my

210
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,260
god after the Great Crash two recessions

211
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:33,230
in a decade it's all and we're getting

212
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,720
older that was followed by the Golden

213
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,310
Age of growth the strongest period of

214
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,560
growth we'd ever had and per capita

215
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,910
income growth so I think that's just

216
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,010
worth berry and then we didn't hear

217
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,350
about it again and then in emerging

218
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,880
markets just finally the number of

219
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,360
people entering the middle class is

220
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,580
astounding we're at a point now where

221
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,320
around three billion people so this is a

222
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,420
billion more than ten years ago a

223
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,690
billion more than ten years ago are

224
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,610
actually in the middle

225
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,920
class out of seven billion people in the

226
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,440
world and it is coming from newly

227
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,390
emerging economies joining the middle

228
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,630
class becoming middle-income countries

229
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:12,000
by 2030 more than half the world will be

230
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:15,270
middle class we've never had this many

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,600
people not just emerge from poverty but

232
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:20,579
actually enjoy a standard of living that

233
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,410
we all hope for the rest of the world so

234
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,870
if we could get through the short-term

235
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,579
the medium-term I think actually looks

236
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,080
quite promising thank you so we have a

237
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,150
new definition of optimism there are

238
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:35,340
always crisis professor well I was

239
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,680
getting depressed here increasingly as I

240
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,090
was listening to my colleagues and I was

241
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,969
thinking my but then finally there was a

242
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,770
bit of an upturn no I think you probably

243
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,140
know that the economics what's called a

244
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,910
dismal science you know because the

245
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,130
economists always tend to say you see

246
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,910
the problems and see the the dangers and

247
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,960
so forth

248
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:57,240
and we did you know of course the good

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,100
stuff is always under under lying but

250
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,420
but has to point out the dangers because

251
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,550
if you don't point out the dangers and

252
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,770
there won't be action to deal with the

253
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,469
dangers so it's good economists have

254
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,180
this mission we need to alert everybody

255
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,220
to where the lurking dangers are and

256
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:16,079
then we can we can try to deal with them

257
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:17,820
now you know one of the economists that

258
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,730
Linda wrote about of course is Keynes

259
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,680
and if you think about what the

260
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,240
alternatives are monetary policy can't

261
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,739
do much anymore because you're down to

262
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,690
very low interest rates but then there's

263
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,790
always fiscal policy in Kingsville it's

264
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,170
simply smiled and said well but we have

265
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:34,020
another leg to stand on

266
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,000
wouldn't he so you know I think if

267
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,210
governments really if there is really a

268
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,830
problem there always is fiscal policy

269
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,960
now you know mr. Paws works a strange

270
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:46,500
sort of way so you you have Trump saying

271
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,510
we need to spend more now you know I'm

272
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,520
not particularly a partisan of mr. Trump

273
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,230
oh I should say to you just in terms of

274
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,140
full disclosure I'm a citizen to Peru

275
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:57,990
not of the United States and although I

276
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,510
now teach at the University I was a main

277
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,070
bank regulator in Peru so you know I

278
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:05,100
come this at this from from the

279
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,870
viewpoint of a small latin-american

280
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,950
country on the west coast of South

281
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:11,530
America that you know how

282
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,750
no waitin in world affairs particularly

283
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,520
but we do try to make noise once in a

284
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,690
while and we do have Cusco not your

285
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,400
picture some of you are probably

286
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,980
familiar with those were those locations

287
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,290
they're very interesting yeah yeah I do

288
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,270
have a rather positive view of what's

289
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,189
gonna happen in this developing world

290
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,350
and Linda just told us that there's

291
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:31,030
gonna be a lot of people coming into the

292
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,460
middle class now a lot of that is China

293
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:36,069
of course I'm trying out so big that

294
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,440
China overwhelms all the statistics in

295
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,090
in South America its Brazil overwhelming

296
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,820
all the statistics when you when you do

297
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:44,440
the aggregate data it's always Brazil if

298
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,700
you take out Brazil then everything

299
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,140
looks different if you take out China

300
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,550
everything looks different also and then

301
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,199
take out India on top of that and then

302
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,290
things look even more different okay

303
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,400
but what are they you know what are sort

304
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,230
of the underlying some of these things

305
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,000
that are happening and that happened

306
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:01,210
happening all along and there have been

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,840
accelerating since 2008-2009 one is

308
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:07,630
Financial Inclusion starting about 2010

309
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,460
alone a convictions been to grow that if

310
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,930
you don't deal with Financial Inclusion

311
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,610
you don't bring people into the

312
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,250
financial system then we're not gonna

313
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:16,870
make progress and then there is even an

314
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,310
RN in an organization called the

315
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,590
Alliance for Financial Inclusion

316
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,359
now that didn't exist ten years ago I

317
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,830
guess it just celebrated tenth

318
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,190
anniversary so just about when it

319
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,630
started and this collects most of the

320
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,180
regulator's around the world not the

321
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,670
OECD regulators it's all the non OECD

322
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,099
people they've gotten together 8090 of

323
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:39,310
them or it used to be of us because that

324
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,910
was one of them and you know the concern

325
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:44,739
is to get the poor into the financial

326
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,380
system now you basically do that by

327
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,880
making it easier to get in now if you

328
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,320
want to open a bank account and all you

329
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,050
want to do is move a few hundred dollars

330
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,310
a month you don't need you only more

331
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,780
than a phone number basically you don't

332
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,000
even need an address and you don't need

333
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,439
a formal ID so it's all it's very easy

334
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,070
but if you didn't want to make it bigger

335
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,510
then you have to show ki k YC right know

336
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,730
your customer so then there are

337
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,410
requirements but the first entry point

338
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,360
is easy didn't used to be that way so

339
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,000
the norm has changed in financial

340
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,460
inclusion most countries have a National

341
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,890
Financial Inclusion strategy now that is

342
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,200
also an innovation and that makes a big

343
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,780
difference now then the next thing that

344
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,790
happened is cell phone banking we're

345
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,400
have my cell phone I used to have a very

346
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,380
simple Nokia cell phone that didn't do

347
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,810
much you oh you could just talk on it

348
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,090
but with that kind of cell phone you can

349
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,500
actually do remittances now in China

350
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,270
because that's no problem

351
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,090
in Sweden there's no problem either in

352
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,890
browser and in the rest of the world

353
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,200
it's moved a little more slowly but it's

354
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,840
so true that a mother is sitting

355
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,230
somewhere in Kenya wants to send her son

356
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:53,050
who's in Nairobi you know ten shillings

357
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:57,010
can do that on the telephone so this

358
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,630
used to not be so cell phone banking is

359
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:01,060
the greatest innovation since the

360
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,860
creation of paper money it's been 200

361
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,839
years nothing else has been as this kind

362
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,790
of impact and it's gonna sweep the world

363
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,340
it's not there quite yet because there's

364
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,020
p2p person-to-person functions but

365
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,690
person's anything else doesn't function

366
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,730
quite yet except again China and and and

367
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,960
Sweden but it'll be there you know five

368
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,910
years from now it's gonna look very very

369
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,830
different yeah you know with fin tank

370
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,319
and every herbalist innovating so this

371
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:25,660
is a lot is happening there and I think

372
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,700
that's gonna change the world and if of

373
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,469
course how do they in the developing

374
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,940
world the I did the this morning I

375
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,950
looked up about 12% of the population

376
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,590
where populations in developed countries

377
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,480
88% in less developed countries that's

378
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,550
where the big action is going to be and

379
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,040
if you start taking average of weight

380
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,449
growth rates if you don't if you weight

381
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,160
them by population you're gonna find

382
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:46,690
that the growth it's gonna be higher if

383
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,170
you waited by income that's a different

384
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,460
story

385
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,780
so it tells you something about

386
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,330
statistics we can all live with

387
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,730
statistics right we know how to do that

388
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,860
now the second thing that I think is

389
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:59,490
very important is that there's an

390
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,630
enormous change in the attitude between

391
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,300
companies it through extractive

392
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:06,910
industries such as mining fishing

393
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,250
logging and how they deal with their

394
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:12,640
neighbors used to be that people would

395
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:14,079
go in somewhat abusively to get the ore

396
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,800
out and if the neighbors complained

397
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,419
tough luck

398
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,619
and if the name is completeness Morton

399
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,030
and we shot them you shoot them you

400
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:20,619
bring in the police and if they object

401
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,210
then you know you beat them up and if

402
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,250
that doesn't work you shoot him well

403
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:27,370
that's no longer so there is something

404
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:29,410
called the Equator Principles - it's all

405
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:32,169
major banks have subscribed and the

406
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,400
banks basically would they'd say when

407
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,780
they talk to the customers see look

408
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,760
you're in a place where there's gonna be

409
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,050
conflict you're going to open a new mine

410
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,760
the neighbors are probably going to

411
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,409
object because they're going to believe

412
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,810
rightly or wrongly that you're gonna use

413
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,460
the water and you're gonna pollute but

414
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,620
you have to deal with that

415
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,570
that's risk from our point of view for

416
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,969
the bank's wannabe that's risk we don't

417
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,210
want conflict conflict creates losses

418
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,800
and therefore you better you better see

419
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,990
where you're putting your feet now

420
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,240
that's an enormous change you know they

421
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,790
started in two thousand four or five

422
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,850
more or less the IFC let some of this

423
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,560
city back then followed now there's no

424
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,330
bigger bank that doesn't subscribe to

425
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,070
the Equator Principles with a notable

426
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,379
exception Chinese banks they haven't

427
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,580
quite yet signed up that will happen can

428
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:21,340
you give me another minute and a half

429
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:23,260
two minutes 45 ah minute and 45 45

430
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,830
seconds very good okay

431
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:30,070
next I can come back there if you like

432
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:32,560
the next thing is disasters financial

433
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,040
systems don't worry and regulators don't

434
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,929
worry about disasters storms earthquakes

435
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:41,260
typhoons that's not the financial

436
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:44,680
regulators problem but it is when you

437
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,300
have a disaster the mortgages the houses

438
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,520
the roofs get blown off the mortgages

439
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,200
are worth repenting anymore so you know

440
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,970
but this is beginning to percolate

441
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,550
through the notion that this matters

442
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:56,350
climate changes the next one you're

443
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,870
probably aware of governor Carney the

444
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,730
Bank of England who said this is a

445
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,949
stomach problem and the central banks

446
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,140
are better worried about finance about

447
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,890
the climate change well that's a sea

448
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,930
change when central bank's take on a

449
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:13,780
problem it's going to be dealt with

450
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,280
maybe not perfectly but central bank's

451
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,120
the mobilisation of central bank's on

452
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,670
climate change is a massive difference

453
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,080
in the nature of economic policy and how

454
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,150
it's gonna be implemented and that's

455
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,620
sweeping the world it's back opening its

456
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,600
Bank of France its Bank of the

457
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,879
Netherlands there's now I believe 30 or

458
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,620
35 banks central banks are involved not

459
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,040
yet the central bank of Slovakia but

460
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:39,040
it'll get there and so once you have

461
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,590
central banks involved that means the

462
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,510
problem is going to be dealt with to

463
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,070
some extent now central banks can't do

464
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,440
everything but they're very very

465
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,560
powerful and the banking system the

466
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,050
financial system who is going to be

467
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,179
different five years from now because of

468
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,649
this initiative it won't be recognizable

469
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,690
anymore it'll have a different set of

470
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,180
mandates so these are the positive

471
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,460
long-term things we do have to get

472
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:06,360
through the winter but you know the

473
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,530
spring does come it's pointed out you

474
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,510
know whatever it comes down it's gonna

475
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,710
have to go up that's it in the nature of

476
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,920
elevators right

477
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,540
it bounces back and so I'm on the

478
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,030
optimistic side even though I practice

479
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,620
at dismal science but you don't have to

480
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,270
be consistent on these matters professor

481
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,409
thank you very much for turning the mood

482
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:28,490
in the room I would have a question

483
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:31,200
azita as a practitioner from Wall Street

484
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,450
professor didn't call it like that but

485
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,290
he spoke more more or less about lessons

486
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,970
learned after 10 years after let's let's

487
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,700
put it like what's the is there any

488
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:44,490
particular thing you see in Wall Street

489
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,860
that has changed as a lesson a lesson

490
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:48,810
learned or two three lessons learned

491
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,429
which which are changing the Wall Street

492
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:59,220
way of functioning thinking about what

493
00:20:52,430 --> 00:21:01,650
what is happening they're saying that

494
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,840
someone once made an analogy between the

495
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,120
culture of Wall Street and the culture

496
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,860
of competitive cycling I don't know a

497
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,830
few recyclers you know what Lance

498
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,810
Armstrong ended up doing and so the

499
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,899
point is that the cultures are very

500
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:18,300
similar they attract very competitive

501
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,850
people who like to win sometimes at any

502
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:24,149
cost and there's not a lot of regulation

503
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:26,459
so that sometimes ends up not in a good

504
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:30,600
place and so the point is that the

505
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:34,260
lesson is that we need to regulate the

506
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,909
behavior I want to just say that we have

507
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,790
to at the start we have to make a

508
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,670
distinction between financial crises and

509
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:44,280
market shocks not all market shocks lead

510
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:47,370
to financial crises that impact the real

511
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,520
economy and real lives example Black

512
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:54,330
Monday 1987 I was there the market the

513
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,190
Dow dropped 22% next day it was up there

514
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,870
was injection of liquidity by the Fed

515
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,480
and so forth and that didn't impact the

516
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:04,100
real economy it was just a market shock

517
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:08,760
same thing in 1989

518
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:13,070
the US financial system today is built

519
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:16,550
on lessons that were gained from the

520
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:20,870
financial crises of the Great Depression

521
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:23,879
1929-30 and 2008 the Great Recession

522
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,800
arguably the largest financial crisis

523
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,300
we've had since the Great Depression out

524
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:33,810
of that came FDIC the SEC Social

525
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:37,940
Security out of the 2008 crises we had

526
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:42,780
the dodd-frank consumer protection laws

527
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:45,690
the problem is the lessons are there but

528
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,820
a sometimes they are not the right

529
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,040
lessons and they're just technical

530
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:52,800
lessons so of course we need to change

531
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,220
leverage ratios or have stress tests or

532
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,430
have rules for regulators and

533
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:04,200
impartiality and so forth but then the

534
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:06,420
reality of those lessons those lessons

535
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,840
don't survive contact with reality of

536
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:13,050
politics basically so almost as soon as

537
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,840
dodd-frank was passed the next the GOP

538
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:18,930
was arguing for its repeal or parts of

539
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,270
it to be repealed there was there's

540
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:24,570
always attention at least in our system

541
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:26,340
about the role of government and so the

542
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,580
lessons learned on the one hand are

543
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,760
technical we put in rules to protect

544
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,970
against another financial crises similar

545
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,379
to what has just happened we had

546
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:39,450
glass-steagall or Volcker rule and these

547
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,540
are technical rules and they're lessons

548
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,790
to be implemented one lesson that we

549
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,070
learned is that it's extremely important

550
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:50,639
for the integrity and the trust in the

551
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:53,010
financial markets to to be for them to

552
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,380
be perceived as impartial the

553
00:23:53,010 --> 00:24:00,000
impartiality of regulators the

554
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:02,760
impartiality of the Fed of the SEC this

555
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,800
that needs to be maintained for the

556
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,660
trust in the financial markets we need

557
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,480
to keep politics out of the financial

558
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,880
markets that's a lesson

559
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,220
fortunately that was their possible with

560
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,529
Donald Trump tweeting well you just took

561
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,000
the words out of my mouth I think that's

562
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:21,630
the challenge that's being stressed

563
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,600
tested but that is a real danger the

564
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,940
uncertainty that that politicize

565
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,158
politicization creates is a real danger

566
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,139
to the financial markets because

567
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,960
investors don't like uncertainty under

568
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:36,059
most circumstances but unless they're

569
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,929
trading volatility but they certainly

570
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:41,760
don't like it when it comes to not

571
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:44,610
knowing whether politics is going to

572
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,049
affect a financial decision when I was

573
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,719
there and one of the crises that

574
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:51,059
happened and my money supply that

575
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,980
whatever the the Fed was doing that was

576
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,110
always separate from whatever the

577
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,919
government government was doing so that

578
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:02,908
that helps create some trust and and I

579
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:06,330
think at the end of the day I agree with

580
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:09,960
Danny that those reasons are reasons for

581
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:12,330
optimism but all of this goes back to

582
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,179
value system because market systems I

583
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,279
think ultimately our value systems and I

584
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:20,419
say that partly based on my experience

585
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,769
also as in diplomacy and in politics

586
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:25,769
connecting that to my experience on Wall

587
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:27,299
Street in that when we create market

588
00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:30,299
systems that respond to certain

589
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:32,309
incentives we are validating or we are

590
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:34,110
responding to the values that we have so

591
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:38,629
in the United States and a culture that

592
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:42,149
values individualism and and profit and

593
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:47,330
rewards risk perhaps disproportionately

594
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:51,510
to having a safety net that protects a

595
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:53,549
basic level of safety we have a certain

596
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,320
outcome in Sweden where I was you have

597
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:57,210
more of a safety net but you also have

598
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,850
the upside for capitalism in each system

599
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,210
there's give and take but it reflects

600
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:05,428
our values and our social values and I

601
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:08,490
think that may be where we need to look

602
00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:11,760
more for signs of optimism what is the

603
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:13,799
value system that's going to inform our

604
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,760
market system in our economic system

605
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:21,750
that ultimately leverages and harnesses

606
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,170
in in its most complete form the human

607
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:25,180
capital in a society

608
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,830
so that we have resilience in the labour

609
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:32,760
market when we have a financial crisis

610
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:35,949
this value question leads me to the like

611
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,960
analogy we had a fail Wall Street which

612
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:42,400
ended up of Eko being being jailed for

613
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,890
breaching the law we had a wall street

614
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,250
to film well it was more about a clash

615
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,710
of two generations views on how to make

616
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:53,710
money in this big Wall Street world we

617
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:56,860
have a wall street 3 film where for

618
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,840
example newvalue climate change or the

619
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,810
climate the protection of the climate

620
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,030
will be kind of a new value which will

621
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,730
play a role in the decision-making

622
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,889
either on Wall Street or in economic

623
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:11,650
theories is this new thing which is

624
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:13,690
coming shaping you know in Europe now we

625
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:15,550
live with the with the Swedish Swedish

626
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,160
girl protesting against the climate

627
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,560
change and it's it's a I would say kind

628
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,750
of hype a little bit but it's bringing

629
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,780
attention to the to the topic is this

630
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:28,960
being included already as one of the

631
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:33,660
lessons learned maybe or completely you

632
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:37,060
think Linda I think the values debate is

633
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:39,340
absolutely what we need to have and it's

634
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:42,399
not the first time in history the issues

635
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:45,520
are always particular to the context of

636
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,620
today and today we do need to talk a lot

637
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,870
more about climate change but again if

638
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,000
you look back over history when you have

639
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,520
time to break down in consensus around

640
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,350
the best economic system it's always

641
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,540
because there are issues but the

642
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,909
economic system isn't adequately

643
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,920
addressing and it hasn't kept up with

644
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:09,450
the the values that people hold so let

645
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:14,830
me give you a more concrete example so

646
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:17,050
the there's been numerous breakdowns in

647
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,669
consensus around the best economic

648
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,990
system and the issues which ought to be

649
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,300
addressed I'm going to point out one

650
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,310
which i think is quite important which

651
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:29,350
was I'm gonna take you all the way back

652
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:33,100
to I'm 1846 so that was when the corn

653
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:34,510
laws were repealed in Britain okay

654
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,610
nobody remember says unless you're

655
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:41,559
historian but it was actually momentous

656
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:44,889
because yeah so at the time essentially

657
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,809
the consensus was for mercantilism so

658
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:51,150
this is the idea that country should run

659
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:54,850
trade surpluses and this is I'm stemming

660
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,920
even better if you could find some gold

661
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:01,120
and silver and bring it back to your

662
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:04,120
country that's it that's great so it

663
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,739
actually took great economist cough the

664
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,590
classical economists like David Ricardo

665
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:11,140
to argue that actually no that isn't

666
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:14,409
that is not the way to engage and this

667
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,850
is remember 1846 this is the nineteenth

668
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,020
century when the world is becoming

669
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:22,299
connected and so and the the consensus

670
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,580
was overturned because it seemed it was

671
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:29,290
better to to trade and to be open to

672
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,360
exchange and specialize and oh by the

673
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:33,639
way the prime minister who repealed the

674
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,459
Corn Laws a Robert Peel he lost his

675
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,230
Premiership shortly thereafter and then

676
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,169
his political party was cast out into

677
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:45,010
the wilderness for generation but the

678
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:48,700
outcome was a much more interconnected

679
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:51,970
world and prosperity accompanying the

680
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:54,370
industrializing British economy German

681
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:57,760
economy American economy but that

682
00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:00,059
consensus quickly broke down in 1873 so

683
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:04,030
the long depression of the 19th century

684
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:06,309
is happened after the panic of 1873 a US

685
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,080
financial crisis spread across the

686
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:10,660
Atlantic and made people extremely

687
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,030
disillusioned about the financial system

688
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:17,350
about capitalism and about globalization

689
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:19,149
that led to unemployment becoming a word

690
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,370
for the first time it led to the rise of

691
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:24,460
trade unionism and the rise of Marxism

692
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,620
so by the early 20th century 60% of the

693
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,590
world lived in either communist or

694
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:32,379
socialist regimes so this eventually led

695
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,000
to the market-based economies arguing

696
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:37,450
their position and the creation of the

697
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,400
welfare state so by the 20th century by

698
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,700
really the middle of the 20th century

699
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,620
the so took a long time welfare state

700
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:49,250
capitalism was created the welfare state

701
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:51,620
here in Europe and the NHS in Britain

702
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:52,910
another example and of course the early

703
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,709
part of the 20th century saw the

704
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:58,340
establishment of social security in the

705
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:02,540
United States so essentially it seemed

706
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:04,129
as if capitalism was picking up the need

707
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:08,870
to have a social safety net and more

708
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:12,020
inclusiveness to address some of this

709
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,879
backlash and this battle wasn't won

710
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,210
until probably the end of the Cold War

711
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,700
at the end of the 1980s even China the

712
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,520
biggest communist country in the world

713
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:25,400
injected market-based incentives into

714
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,620
its economy and in fact there's a great

715
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,160
quote by JK Galbraith this great

716
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:34,820
economist I write about he said at that

717
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:38,210
point you might think China's communist

718
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:39,710
but he said politically but economically

719
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,020
he said the difference between

720
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,840
capitalism and communism is that under

721
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:48,879
capitalism man exploits man under

722
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:53,929
communism it's the exact opposite and so

723
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:57,170
the and so by so it seemed like we had a

724
00:31:53,930 --> 00:32:00,260
new consensus by the 1990s but now

725
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:02,870
thirty year on after the biggest

726
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,330
financial crash since the 1930s the

727
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,280
consensus is broken down we're now again

728
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,590
questioning whether the economic system

729
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:12,200
is dealing with the issues that we'd

730
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:16,159
care about things like climate change

731
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,320
high levels of inequality the elites

732
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:22,460
doing better than any but then everybody

733
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,100
else a re-examination of not just

734
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,620
socialism but I've heard people admire

735
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,929
Marxism once again so we are now at a

736
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,780
point where consensus is broken down we

737
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:34,850
need to talk about values we need to

738
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:37,129
talk about how you can take a to take

739
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,800
this opportunity like the great thinkers

740
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:42,380
of the posited and craft a new system

741
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,570
that's much more suited for the 21st

742
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,800
century and the issues that we're facing

743
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,169
today

744
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,240
I just want to remind you you are in the

745
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,260
country surrounded by the countries

746
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,550
which has we had have had quite a

747
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:00,470
extensive experience with applied

748
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:04,040
Marxism and what we hear this Marxism

749
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:05,510
being again in kind of fashion as we

750
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,100
hear it from the Western Europe and from

751
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:10,310
the West and I recently met a group of

752
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:14,600
American New Yorkers not Americans New

753
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:17,419
Yorkers specific and and they and I was

754
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,370
you know amazed how they were talking

755
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,350
and and it was the reaction of the

756
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:23,870
trumpian calling from fascist I told

757
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,820
them well we have a fascism experience

758
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,100
here as well so be careful about about

759
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,929
this labeling and these were the real

760
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:33,230
Marxist you know but we have a practical

761
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:36,350
experience so that's that's I think that

762
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:40,760
one of the experiences this region could

763
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:43,340
add to this debate about the values that

764
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,050
it's quite careful but I just want to

765
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,439
add one other thing one important lesson

766
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:50,270
from the 2008 crisis which is that what

767
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:51,920
is different today from this really

768
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:54,650
fascinating history that you just

769
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:57,620
described is that markets financial

770
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:59,960
crises are now global if one country

771
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,850
sneezes the whole world catches the cold

772
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,260
right so you could be sitting here

773
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,270
minding your own business and doing

774
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:07,490
everything right and we in the u.s. do

775
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:09,649
something and suddenly your economy is

776
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:13,730
in a tailspin because you're affected by

777
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:16,759
what's happening globally and that makes

778
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:19,850
it even more it's more of an imperative

779
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,010
than for each country to be able to have

780
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,379
some preventive measures in a sense to

781
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,760
protect themselves or to inoculate

782
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:28,969
themselves from something like that

783
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,490
affecting them affecting their economy

784
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:34,459
and that's why creating a resilient

785
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:35,870
labor market and workforce is really

786
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,149
important I just want to share this

787
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:40,759
statistic that I just read that I just

788
00:34:38,149 --> 00:34:43,690
blew my mind there's a rand study that

789
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:47,270
showed that one in four American

790
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:51,260
Americans cannot cover an expected

791
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:52,850
expenditure of $400 $400 without

792
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,179
borrowing or selling something

793
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:59,509
one out of four the second one that was

794
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:02,090
even more astonishing is that 78% of

795
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:04,490
American workers live paycheck to

796
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,980
paycheck I thought that would be like 40

797
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,839
percents almost 80% of Americans live

798
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,520
paycheck to paycheck doesn't mean they

799
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,600
live in poverty but they're used to

800
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,000
certain spending habits

801
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,220
financial crises don't always come from

802
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,590
market shocks we just had a big one in

803
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,950
the US when we had a 35 days shutdown of

804
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:25,680
the government where people those that's

805
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:28,560
78 percent had a financial crises but we

806
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,990
don't think of it that way so and then

807
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,570
financial crises are not systemic either

808
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:36,720
so every American that lives paycheck to

809
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:39,660
paycheck is one L nasaan one job loss

810
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,709
away from their own financial crisis and

811
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:47,279
that is not a sustainable way for any

812
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:49,470
economy to thrive when we're very very

813
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,940
vulnerable in that sense we have a

814
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:54,330
couple of questions already on slide oh

815
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,610
I would maybe merge two of them one is

816
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,560
about cryptocurrencies what do you think

817
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:02,730
about them and how they can help to

818
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,680
prevent further possible further for the

819
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,110
crisis plus there is a there's a

820
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,490
question about the new technologies we

821
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,500
see the new technologies everywhere

822
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,970
except for productivity statistics any

823
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,830
recommendation how to increase the

824
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,709
productivity growth what is the role of

825
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:21,270
the new technologies cryptocurrencies

826
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:23,940
included in in this because these were

827
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:27,690
not like part of the crisis last last

828
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:30,150
time is are they helping or making

829
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,590
situation more complex or harder I'll

830
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,660
just say that I was in structured

831
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:35,700
derivatives and I don't understand

832
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,440
cryptocurrencies I can explain it to you

833
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,009
but I don't understand how they work so

834
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,290
I'll let you do it

835
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:45,600
if I may I just like to add a comment to

836
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,370
the previous topic you know what's

837
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,529
different now than a hundred years ago

838
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,020
and what why is why is it changed what's

839
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,160
what's moving is you know if you think

840
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,520
of the 1800s

841
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,870
you know 1850 or something like that

842
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,520
what happened in one place

843
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,950
who didn't impact much what happened

844
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,960
somewhere else you'd been in London and

845
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,009
Birmingham didn't matter much you went

846
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,170
on and certainly what happened the

847
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,030
United States was of no concern or

848
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,460
impact as somebody they was living in

849
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:14,250
England nor nor Germany what happened in

850
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,020
China mannered to nobody so but now

851
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:18,540
that's different in that there has a

852
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,230
there's a name for that in economics

853
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:24,000
it's called externalities whence what

854
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,250
person a does affects what person D does

855
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,260
but indirectly

856
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,730
used to be there is something James

857
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,460
dusenbery wrote about keeping up with

858
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,080
the Joneses you're happy in accordance

859
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,550
to what your neighbors do right and if

860
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,120
your neighbor has got richer you feel

861
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,910
poorer

862
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,220
now that's denied by economic theory

863
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,740
that that's not included and when I went

864
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,970
to graduate school externalities was

865
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:47,399
something that you read one article

866
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:50,189
about and then you just concluded that

867
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,620
it was irrelevant today the big

868
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:54,630
externalities climate climate affects

869
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,799
everybody and if we don't intervene

870
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,420
individual doesn't take into account

871
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,970
what they do on climate and how climate

872
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:03,060
impacts on them then we're all worse off

873
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:05,310
so this isn't sea change and that

874
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,740
affects interdependence everybody is now

875
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:09,150
interdependent with everybody else

876
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,609
externality is actually what we call is

877
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,190
to in turn to interconnector to fail

878
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:16,650
exactly exactly you big to fail to

879
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,930
interconnect exactly exactly but the

880
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:20,880
problem is that we can't each of us

881
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,129
individually can't do very much about it

882
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,410
now there's some folks again you know

883
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,810
the united countries can do more about a

884
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,190
little little countries that the big

885
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,600
companies could do more about in the

886
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,570
little companies the central banks can

887
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,980
do a lot about it the the stock market

888
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,600
regulators can do a lot about it so

889
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,690
there are institutions that can have a

890
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,600
global impact others cannot individual

891
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:44,880
simply cannot but insofar as individuals

892
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,980
force their governments to do something

893
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,690
then the government's can so but this is

894
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:52,770
a tremendous change and we need to

895
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,080
understand it realize this

896
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,420
interdependence once we have then that

897
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,400
things follow what kind of capitalism

898
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:01,860
and we need to have follows where

899
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,690
economic system we need to have follows

900
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,790
and even the Chinese government it's

901
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:07,320
kind of wound up recognize it already

902
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,180
has in something climate change that's

903
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,770
recognized clearly that what they what

904
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:13,350
they do in Beijing affects everybody

905
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,390
else so this is I think the great you

906
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,980
know that the next version of the book

907
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:19,620
that you that you write you're gonna

908
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,810
probably have to have you know something

909
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:24,240
about who thought about externalities

910
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:26,610
and you know P goo what did he did see

911
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,140
in 1900 or not generated five you know

912
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,420
there are this people did think about

913
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:33,359
this but it wasn't important now it's

914
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,280
important and I think that is something

915
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,350
that once we recognize it

916
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,970
we're totally able to deal with it but

917
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,720
first they don't know it all starts up

918
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,240
here

919
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:44,549
we don't understand what's going on we

920
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,140
can't cope with him just on the

921
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:48,480
cryptocurrencies and financial

922
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:51,210
technologies I think cryptocurrencies

923
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,420
are just the latest form of private

924
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:56,789
money privately issued money so in one

925
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,760
sense the this has been talked about for

926
00:39:56,789 --> 00:40:02,910
a century by economists like Milton

927
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,099
Friedman who said why not you know if

928
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,410
you had a currency which is recognized

929
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,630
by somebody else you can always use it

930
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,149
as a medium of exchange that's all money

931
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:14,490
really is so I think but in terms of

932
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:16,619
policy it complicates the policy-making

933
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:20,270
process because it's already the case

934
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:24,770
that central bank's find it difficult to

935
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:27,930
essentially both measure and control

936
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:31,349
money so interest rates are the price of

937
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:34,859
money and we already know where we are

938
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:36,869
with their quantitative easing is a form

939
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,038
of controlling the supply of money so

940
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:40,950
you either control the price of the

941
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:42,960
quantity what you try to do both and the

942
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,450
quantity of money is going to be made

943
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,430
more complicated by cryptocurrencies and

944
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,649
the other thing central banks have to do

945
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:53,520
is they have to anticipate the movement

946
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:56,789
of the money supply so again we knew we

947
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,700
learn 10 years ago there's a disconnect

948
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:02,970
between the measures of inflation and

949
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,859
the measures of the quiddity so by

950
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:06,930
targeting inflation you miss still

951
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:07,650
build-up and credit which fed the

952
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,890
housing bubble

953
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:13,710
so clearly cryptocurrencies as another

954
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:16,140
measure and another level of liquidity

955
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,240
which is already very difficult for

956
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,089
central banks to try and tackle which is

957
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,299
why currently macro prudential measures

958
00:41:21,089 --> 00:41:26,430
which are new ministry of tools employed

959
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:32,430
by a number of major central banks now

960
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:36,750
is geared at trying to control or at

961
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:39,868
least try and measure that leverage

962
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:41,730
credit liquidity growth so i think those

963
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:43,230
are some of the things probably too to

964
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,700
think about but i think you know

965
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,430
generally and danny mentioned this

966
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,470
financial innovation so around

967
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:52,169
productivity so one of the big puzzles

968
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,310
of our time is productivity growth is

969
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:57,420
slowing across

970
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:59,460
the world and this is so this is called

971
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,790
the solo paradox Robert Solow the great

972
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,530
economist said you can see the computer

973
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:07,740
age everywhere except in the

974
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:10,050
productivity data and in fact there's a

975
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:13,410
Bank of England study that shows that as

976
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,960
penetration of this goes up productivity

977
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:19,529
actually goes this way

978
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:22,440
so can the digital inventions of today

979
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:24,270
raise productivity in the way that

980
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,100
electrification or the internal

981
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,770
combustion engine did that is the big

982
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:30,630
question of our time and I suppose one

983
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:32,520
thing to think about in terms of FinTech

984
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,950
which is just innovation the financial

985
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:40,070
sector most of that is around making

986
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:43,740
payments easier so it addresses

987
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:46,080
financial addresses under banking and

988
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,520
increases Financial Inclusion so I wrote

989
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,130
a piece for the World Economic Forum

990
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,590
which essentially argues FinTech could

991
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:55,010
be the technology that could give us

992
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:57,840
that economy wide productivity boost

993
00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:00,390
because it does something very different

994
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,850
than perhaps even what uh you know what

995
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:05,750
time some of the digital like social

996
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:10,319
media tech does FinTech translates

997
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:13,710
savings into investment and that is one

998
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:18,630
of the most important drivers of growth

999
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:21,900
investment becomes funds for industry it

1000
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:24,960
becomes funds for investment and so can

1001
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,890
we see productivity across the economy

1002
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,510
be increased

1003
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:32,879
I think vintage gives us a good chance

1004
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:35,520
of it but ultimately this is as I say

1005
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,500
you know the puzzle we are surrounded by

1006
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:42,350
tech and yet somehow we are finding

1007
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,160
productivity is actually slowing

1008
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,620
everywhere including

1009
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,660
economies like China I just went to

1010
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,460
speaking of technologies if you are shy

1011
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:54,120
to you slide oh you can also raise your

1012
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:56,310
hand to have it to have a question but

1013
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,310
Professor had some some remark oh I just

1014
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:00,630
just a note of caution about in

1015
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:03,990
interpreting productivity data because

1016
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:05,310
you know computers are wonderful and but

1017
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,640
it's something called garbage in garbage

1018
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,980
out so

1019
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,480
you know it's only the data that comes

1020
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,120
out of computers only as good as what

1021
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,710
you put in productivity is must have one

1022
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,440
of the most difficult things to measure

1023
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:21,340
so economists have measures they

1024
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,230
extremely imperfect you know you have a

1025
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:25,090
lot of employment and the people sit

1026
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,290
around doing nothing so you know how do

1027
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,170
you measure that with the wages paid

1028
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:31,270
with how many hours they worked you know

1029
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,740
when you have different mixes of labor

1030
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:34,990
and capital and different kinds of

1031
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,240
capital the issues of aggregation

1032
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,709
extremely difficult and you know Luna

1033
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,720
knows all about this and you know it's

1034
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,740
it's something economists wrestle with

1035
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,290
we don't have a good answer

1036
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:47,410
so when you see productivity edit data

1037
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:50,680
take them with three spoonfuls of salt

1038
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:52,720
they're not very good figures they're

1039
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,549
not very good figures don't believe them

1040
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,410
very much it may turn out that

1041
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:58,750
productivity as measure is going down

1042
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:01,330
but purgative a Tyrian reality is going

1043
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:02,860
up totally possible totally possible so

1044
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:05,529
when I see particulate and I said to

1045
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,670
myself hmm interesting okay now let's go

1046
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,740
on to the next topic I don't believe

1047
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:12,060
what I see on paper much less what I

1048
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:14,470
hear on the radio yes

1049
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:19,000
my name is Bobo lo I'm an independent

1050
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:21,250
analyst ambassador you mentioned that

1051
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,290
we're more vulnerable to the next

1052
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,680
financial crisis than we were ten years

1053
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:28,480
ago

1054
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:31,330
Linda you speak about the period you

1055
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,490
know economic crises are periodical

1056
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:36,700
we're going to have a have them anyway

1057
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:40,180
it's so my real question is what does

1058
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:54,520
the next global financial crisis look

1059
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:55,750
like how bad will it get I'll tell you

1060
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,790
where it starts ambassador will tell you

1061
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:00,640
how bad it gets okay it's in start in

1062
00:45:57,790 --> 00:46:02,500
the clearinghouses the the concentration

1063
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,319
of clearinghouse data is extremely very

1064
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:08,830
extremely large so clearing houses and

1065
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:13,120
they're very very thinly capitalized if

1066
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:14,590
somebody large defaults and obviously

1067
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,810
goes through a clearing house clearing

1068
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:18,080
house may fall and then you have a major

1069
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:20,360
crisis

1070
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,400
now you know there's been the Economist

1071
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,560
wrote about this recently you know so

1072
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,150
you're not saying something that is

1073
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,940
confidential any sense

1074
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:30,260
there's a real danger there now

1075
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,930
ambassador will tell us what the what

1076
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:37,760
the outfit might be thanks for giving me

1077
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:42,890
time to think I think the next one will

1078
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:47,170
be triggered by student loan bubble of

1079
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:49,609
student loan debt in the United States I

1080
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:55,130
have worked through a couple of

1081
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:57,500
financial crises there was program

1082
00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:03,200
obviously program trading was blamed for

1083
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:09,140
the 87 one there was the SNL crisis then

1084
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:12,529
the 2008 was blamed on counterparty risk

1085
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:14,330
and derivatives of which I was a part of

1086
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:17,810
creating those structured derivatives I

1087
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:20,060
have they have a good use but then again

1088
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:22,310
they have to be regulated I think the

1089
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:25,100
next and then emerging markets was

1090
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:26,600
another one so and I remember after one

1091
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:28,310
of those crises we were sitting around

1092
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:32,420
with my colleagues in the trading floor

1093
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:34,310
and and he was saying well you know

1094
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:36,380
they're so pass and there'll be another

1095
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,299
one and it's exactly what happens

1096
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,980
because we the lesson to learn is that

1097
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,890
we don't learn lessons so what do we do

1098
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,420
to protect ourselves from ourselves we

1099
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:47,120
have to have structures and and

1100
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:52,520
frameworks I think the student loan debt

1101
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:56,060
is a serious bubble and I hope that we

1102
00:47:52,520 --> 00:48:04,730
can have policy solutions to to lessen

1103
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:06,950
the burden I mean how do we feel it in

1104
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:10,010
the general population should I take

1105
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:12,399
that in terms of yeah so it's true that

1106
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:15,170
not every financial crisis has a

1107
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,750
significant real economy impact so

1108
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:20,210
market crashes like the ones that have

1109
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:23,120
been mentioned and in some respects

1110
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:25,480
that's the best kind of outcome you can

1111
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:29,960
hope for in other words there's enough

1112
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,579
regulatory safeguards that a crisis is

1113
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,640
essentially contained

1114
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:37,599
and doesn't become widespread across the

1115
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,009
economy and that it's not systemic

1116
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,130
because the systemic crises are the

1117
00:48:40,009 --> 00:48:46,430
existential ones and what we see is

1118
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:52,400
generally speaking financial crises are

1119
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:54,739
triggered by debt and exuberance so if

1120
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,170
you look at any measure of asset bubbles

1121
00:48:54,739 --> 00:48:58,759
in different countries those are

1122
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,819
essentially normally they're telltale

1123
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:05,380
signs so macro Prudential Regulation is

1124
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:07,729
intended to try and curb the growth of

1125
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:11,479
bubbles and this is the lesson of in

1126
00:49:07,729 --> 00:49:13,218
2008 when Alan Greenspan said I don't

1127
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:15,160
want to be the person who takes away the

1128
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:18,289
punchbowl when the party gets started

1129
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,808
now they do lean against the wind the

1130
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:22,849
question is it's hard to spot whether

1131
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:28,400
something is a bubble or whether

1132
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:33,249
something is just underlying strength in

1133
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:36,109
say technology that boosts the Nasdaq or

1134
00:49:33,249 --> 00:49:39,078
limited supply that boosts the housing

1135
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:41,989
market or high demand for higher

1136
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,819
education that boosts debt it's really

1137
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:45,920
difficult to differentiate but what we

1138
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:48,558
do know is that you don't have a crash

1139
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,499
without a bubble so you have to look for

1140
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:54,289
what you can do now my feeling I started

1141
00:49:51,499 --> 00:49:58,459
my career as a corporate lawyer and I

1142
00:49:54,289 --> 00:50:01,699
don't ever believe that or all

1143
00:49:58,459 --> 00:50:04,788
regulations are tailored for the last

1144
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:08,749
crisis and you can understand why how

1145
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:12,400
could you know what you all you can do

1146
00:50:08,749 --> 00:50:14,988
is hope you've put in enough what I call

1147
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,900
safeguards against a crisis becoming

1148
00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:19,670
systemic because what happens with a lot

1149
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:21,949
of these crises think about to the early

1150
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:24,199
1990s there was a coordinated housing

1151
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:26,660
market crash across Europe it was

1152
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:30,349
devastating for people who went into

1153
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:34,009
negative equity is scarred a generation

1154
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:35,569
of graduates if you graduate and during

1155
00:50:34,009 --> 00:50:38,390
a period of high unemployment your

1156
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:42,890
lifetime earnings are lower you're

1157
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:45,140
scarred so the impact is extensive much

1158
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,569
worse than what you normally think of

1159
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,519
and

1160
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:49,859
oh the government's up allotted debt

1161
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:53,038
yeah that's bad but to be honest is much

1162
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:55,109
worse for people who've graduated at you

1163
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:58,589
know at such a time so to me it's

1164
00:50:55,109 --> 00:51:03,089
whether or not there's enough awareness

1165
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:05,249
that is a systemic nature of any asset

1166
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:10,549
market there needs to be some type of

1167
00:51:05,249 --> 00:51:14,129
break to make sure that it's contained

1168
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:16,139
just on that point both the ambassador

1169
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:18,749
and your point in terms of graduating

1170
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:20,699
you can imagine graduating with this

1171
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:22,319
little huge amount of debt just from an

1172
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:24,809
undergraduate education in the United

1173
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,069
States so this is a u.s. problem it's

1174
00:51:24,809 --> 00:51:28,679
something the ambassador's talked about

1175
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:30,599
as far as debt but in terms of Society

1176
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:33,899
in the United States productivity

1177
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:36,539
efficiency not having a skewed to

1178
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:38,788
workforce of young people who come in

1179
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:40,889
and they can't take certain jobs like in

1180
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:42,269
public health or in the government

1181
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,979
because they have a student debt they've

1182
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:46,229
got to service and they go off and they

1183
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:48,799
do other jobs that's that are good jobs

1184
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:51,029
well-paying jobs but they might be more

1185
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:52,559
effective in terms of society if they

1186
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:54,779
went into Social Work or something like

1187
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,489
that so for the United States what you

1188
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:59,039
were just mentioning whether it's the

1189
00:51:56,489 --> 00:52:00,779
housing issue here in Europe or just

1190
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:03,719
what happens in the United States with

1191
00:52:00,779 --> 00:52:05,519
debt on these young people who come out

1192
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:07,589
of colleges they're ready to go and

1193
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:09,508
they're hobbled it's it's terrible and

1194
00:52:07,589 --> 00:52:11,399
then you have the debt problem on top of

1195
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:12,869
that as the Ambassador was saying just

1196
00:52:11,399 --> 00:52:13,259
as a statement but as a question for you

1197
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:15,929
Linda

1198
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:18,149
you mentioned the Bank of England report

1199
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:20,130
and the productivity and you held up

1200
00:52:18,149 --> 00:52:21,479
your iPhone and said you know you would

1201
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,249
think things were more efficient because

1202
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:25,259
of this but actually the productivity is

1203
00:52:23,249 --> 00:52:27,928
going down and as this proliferate and

1204
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:30,689
it's it's not just iPhones just the

1205
00:52:27,929 --> 00:52:32,459
computer world if you will that's not

1206
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:34,888
intuitive vyas for a lot of us who are

1207
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:36,538
assuming that the efficiencies are going

1208
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:38,429
up I mean I when you said that I thought

1209
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:40,199
about myself and I said yeah I guess I

1210
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:41,579
spend more time on my iPhone that I

1211
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,799
should therefore I'm not as productive

1212
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:46,559
so I could see that but what did the

1213
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:48,809
Bank of England reports say that product

1214
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,939
productivity going down so those are the

1215
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:54,509
reasons what else did they say yeah it's

1216
00:52:50,939 --> 00:52:57,499
a great question so um essentially if

1217
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:57,499
you look at the

1218
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:04,110
so again the other observation from

1219
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,580
Robert Solow so he said the biggest

1220
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,770
difference between giving his secretary

1221
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:09,779
a computer is that before she had one

1222
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:16,500
she worked for him and afterwards he

1223
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:20,730
worked for her there's a there so but I

1224
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:22,500
actually I actually subscribe so there's

1225
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,000
a big debate between the economy so the

1226
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,980
Economist Robert Gordon has written a

1227
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,990
book called the rise and fall of the

1228
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,930
United States there's a reason that the

1229
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:33,299
title ends with fall so the techno

1230
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:35,220
pessimists believe that the trends that

1231
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,050
we currently see are the trends that are

1232
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,419
going to be with us and that underlies

1233
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:42,060
the slowdown and productivity growth

1234
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,430
since the mid-1980s so this has been

1235
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:46,350
going for a long time there's another

1236
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:49,740
version of this which are people who

1237
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:51,810
believe that and this is in terms of

1238
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:54,540
evidence there was one period in the

1239
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:56,670
late 1990s in the United States when

1240
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,770
productivity went up during the height

1241
00:53:56,670 --> 00:54:01,260
of really when the technologies were

1242
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:03,630
beginning to permeate through from the

1243
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,270
computer age maturing that was the only

1244
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:08,790
period when productivity growth was

1245
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:10,410
rising and it's because technologies

1246
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:13,290
were embedded in the way we work

1247
00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:15,509
so most technologies are technologies oh

1248
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,800
wow look at this is cool innovation but

1249
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,810
does it really change your workplace

1250
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:22,890
does it really get used in a productive

1251
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:25,170
way so that's the kind of device I'll

1252
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:27,629
give you another example I was in Japan

1253
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:31,680
recently and they have they have really

1254
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:33,030
advanced AI and robotics so I met a

1255
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,370
robot called pepper

1256
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:39,180
have you ever seen pepper peppers a

1257
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:42,810
humanoid robot pepper function is as a

1258
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:45,450
companion to the old people in Japan so

1259
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:48,060
peppers only function is to read your

1260
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:50,460
emotion so I said on a panel like this

1261
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:52,410
one one day I don't really peppers

1262
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,810
incredibly impressive but I don't see

1263
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:57,089
how pepper really raises productivity

1264
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:58,740
here's other functions you know I don't

1265
00:54:57,090 --> 00:55:00,930
see how he raises productivity across

1266
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,810
the economy and my fellow panelists now

1267
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:05,730
Danny said I don't know how pepper can

1268
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:08,070
raise productivity but if I had a pepper

1269
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,469
robot in my house that read emotions it

1270
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:12,779
would help my marriage

1271
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:14,519
I'm so but I use that as an example

1272
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:16,559
because maybe we don't quite know how to

1273
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:19,828
use pepper yet you know that tech is

1274
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,779
sophisticated so yes finally I also and

1275
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:23,819
I write about this in my book I actually

1276
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:25,829
think the reason why productivity growth

1277
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:27,029
is slowing in advanced economies which

1278
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:29,880
by the way are the cutting edge of

1279
00:55:27,029 --> 00:55:31,890
technology more than emerging markets

1280
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,670
which can to follow us in terms of

1281
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:39,359
trends the vast economies are on average

1282
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:42,959
70% services output is designed to

1283
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:44,420
measure manufacturing services and yeah

1284
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:47,640
so this is the first chapter in my book

1285
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:49,619
which is all about measuring the

1286
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,029
intangible you Cana me actually two

1287
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:53,160
chapters on it so the first chapter is

1288
00:55:51,029 --> 00:55:55,200
on how do you measure services second

1289
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,629
chapter is should we worry about trade

1290
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,930
deficits if you're also unable to

1291
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:02,489
measure services trade so that's called

1292
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:04,140
the invisible balance so basically these

1293
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:06,059
are first two chapters of my latest book

1294
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:10,049
and I essentially to give you the very

1295
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:12,299
short version services output is very

1296
00:56:10,049 --> 00:56:16,170
difficult to measure services exports

1297
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:18,479
almost impossible so it's like it's like

1298
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,239
95% of the universe is comprised of dark

1299
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:23,218
energy we have no idea what it is but we

1300
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:26,940
know it's there and so to me

1301
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:29,219
maybe we just miss measure services and

1302
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:32,130
we're not as unproductive as we think so

1303
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:34,829
for one final example just to give you a

1304
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:36,299
sense of what I mean how many of you

1305
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:40,920
have been in meetings which have been a

1306
00:56:36,299 --> 00:56:42,719
total waste of time how many of you have

1307
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:43,650
been to meetings where you had a

1308
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:46,380
breakthrough

1309
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:48,690
decision may move forward this is you

1310
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,979
know this is gonna propel you to go and

1311
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:55,319
do great things in the world oh my god

1312
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:57,509
okay so my point is a great meeting and

1313
00:56:55,319 --> 00:57:00,299
a useless meeting in services output

1314
00:56:57,509 --> 00:57:04,709
terms are the same because all you're

1315
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:06,959
measuring is revenue wages so and the

1316
00:57:04,709 --> 00:57:09,779
what you sell so this is not at all well

1317
00:57:06,959 --> 00:57:11,038
measured it could be it could be if we

1318
00:57:09,779 --> 00:57:13,019
embed technologies better

1319
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:15,150
and we appreciate that services

1320
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:19,439
economies are differently measured we

1321
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:21,420
may not face such a dire future well my

1322
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,910
role is now to play the bad guy because

1323
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,269
our time is

1324
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:29,269
and but I guess we had a good meeting in

1325
00:57:26,269 --> 00:57:32,779
the post positive positive sense a sense

1326
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:35,959
of the world even the topic wasn't the

1327
00:57:32,779 --> 00:57:39,380
most optimistic but at least we had some

1328
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:41,359
we had some fun so thank you as Italian
