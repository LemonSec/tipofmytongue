1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,099
when the state is not there you have

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,459
someone willing to push aside the state

3
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,079
and replace it behind groups like Isis

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,970
behind website al-shabaab behind groups

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,650
like al-qaeda

6
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,109
religion is generally instrumentalist

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,240
for political end it's a new form of

8
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:29,099
statecraft that is at play political

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,409
economic and social deprivation lead to

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,450
despair and despair always always leads

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,149
to to extremism for the architecture of

12
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,969
security in the Middle East not to be

13
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,940
built on sand it must be built on a

14
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,719
three-fold foundation of good economics

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,699
good politics and deterrent security we

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,770
are dealing in an era now where there's

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,469
a primacy of domestic politics what

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,420
happens in one region has ramifications

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,100
on the rest of the world especially when

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,120
you're talking about a radicalization

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:03,660
and extremism and terrorism we decided

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,780
that someone who had in his mosque a

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,539
certain number of believers per square

24
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,270
meters were legitimate I think we missed

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,920
the point when youth especially young

26
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,350
people take positions that are

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,729
contracted those of both the state in

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,830
which they live and deliciously does

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,780
that lead their communities they are

30
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,110
often inclined not to listen to this

31
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,970
kind of moderation the current situation

32
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,180
requires wisdom patience and

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,399
de-escalation

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,399
