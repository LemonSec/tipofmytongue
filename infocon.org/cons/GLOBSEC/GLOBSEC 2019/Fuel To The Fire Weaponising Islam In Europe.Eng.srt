1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,370
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen well

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:11,210
I didn't hear from you is it because you

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:17,100
haven't had lunch or what is happening

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:21,119
well what you're watching in front of

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,670
you there's good news and there's bad

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,859
news outside with bad news

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:31,230
you're watching a less eloquent version

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,340
of Barack Obama the good news is it's a

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,880
version that is a little bit more

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,070
hopeful about the future of Europe after

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,370
all live and brings it we can find a way

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:47,670
of putting brakes to the exit before you

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:49,349
we will be discussing a topic that's a

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,710
little bit more controversial sometimes

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,710
uncomfortable but at the time such as

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:01:00,539
the one we're facing sometimes we have

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:03,090
to deal with inconvenient truths our

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,280
topic today for this session is going to

19
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,290
be fuel to the fire

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:14,159
weaponizing Islam in Europe now for

21
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:18,540
students of history you must be aware

22
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:22,170
that for about 13 centuries the

23
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,259
dominance of political Islam held a lot

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,590
of currency of course this came to an

25
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,229
end with the fall of the collapse of the

26
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,960
Ottoman Empire and for about a hundred

27
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,850
years there's been a struggle especially

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,850
within the Islamic world or Muslim

29
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,530
dominated lands on how to establish a

30
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,839
legit legitimate form of government this

31
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,570
struggle has been sometimes will cause

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,490
voices from moderate and voices are

33
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,929
extreme

34
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:57,899
now the Arab Spring and the rise of Isis

35
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,869
is testament to the inability to answer

36
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,380
this question now the panelists before

37
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:09,239
you are going to help us walk through

38
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:10,709
the contours of political Islam it has

39
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,860
had an effect not just in the Middle

40
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,690
East but actually here in Europe

41
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,750
increasingly we have seen political

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,900
profit ears use the phobia associated

43
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,110
with Islam or Islamism for political

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,900
mobilization of course often with some

45
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,200
detrimental results at the ballot box

46
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,900
especially for those who believe in

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:39,829
liberal democracy free speech and

48
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:44,850
inclusivity now our audience before you

49
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:47,190
Iman well Abdi worried on tomorrow they

50
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:50,760
walk in this area they have extensive

51
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:55,680
competence both in academia and as

52
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,220
Islamic scholars and they encourage that

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,550
we are going to be as interactive as

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:07,350
possible without limiting our ideas of a

55
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:10,739
house trying to be diplomatically too

56
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:15,150
careful now I'd like to remind your

57
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:18,060
audience that translating kids are right

58
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,750
by your chair it will be a translation

59
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,870
from arabic to english for one of our

60
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,019
panelists and that you can also ask

61
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,720
questions using slider which if you go

62
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,570
to slide it comm with a cord glove SEC

63
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,000
2019 so we can be able to share with our

64
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,000
panelists and get appropriate responses

65
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:47,010
now um Iman well you know some people

66
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,170
are wondering in this room the elephant

67
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,760
that in the room that is rarely

68
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:56,179
discussed especially because of

69
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:59,399
political correctness to what extent is

70
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:04,200
political Islam prevalent in Europe is

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,870
it a threat to European values is it so

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,649
widespread that we need to build bigger

73
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:12,510
walls what's the opinion is your take on

74
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,000
that well I won't be politically correct

75
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,418
that is not how I work but as an

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,599
academic I think it's important to speak

77
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:24,359
precisely of what the question is

78
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:25,580
political Islam has always been in the

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,599
grassroots

80
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,758
of Islam as you all know the Koran

81
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:33,620
replaces a constitution and in some

82
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,590
cases a certain number of Muslim states

83
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:40,000
are abiding by that and there is this up

84
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:43,099
rising again of this will to transform

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,199
national states and to replace

86
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:47,930
Constitution by Sharia this is a case

87
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,009
actually in Sudan as you are very well

88
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:54,050
aware of where a certain number of

89
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:56,840
actors are calling for the chharia to be

90
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:59,629
the new constitution or to pursue the

91
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,409
constitution so the question is whether

92
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:06,759
or not the constitution of modern States

93
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:10,580
European states can be compatible with

94
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:14,840
people who accept it or do not accept it

95
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:16,930
and I think this is the combat or the

96
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,310
issue about those who are wanting to

97
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,930
instrumentalize politically Islam I

98
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,240
don't like the term political Islam

99
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,400
because again political Islam has always

100
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,940
been political it has always been has

101
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:34,758
this issue of governing both spiritually

102
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:38,630
and - a secure base but the politician

103
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:41,120
of Islam which we are seeing both in

104
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:44,509
Europe and in other countries is

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:50,120
something that integrates our own system

106
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:52,099
of values our constitutions are in

107
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,099
French we say vegans are living together

108
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:57,229
capability are challenged by this

109
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:59,779
because we do not have good haven't

110
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:02,690
sorry taken sufficiently in

111
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:05,150
consideration the multiculturalism of

112
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:06,949
our state's and our society and this is

113
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,289
particularly true in France where we've

114
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,719
been a bit stubborn about this issue not

115
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:14,568
comparing Britain or with other

116
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:17,870
anglo-saxon state but it is again an

117
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:20,389
issue I think to finish to be rapid and

118
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,629
hope would be rapid precise on this

119
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:26,810
issue if some is not a threat to Europe

120
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:28,610
for a very historical reason Europe has

121
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,819
been living with Islam for five hundred

122
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:35,060
years al andalus Kingdom was a reality

123
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:37,159
in spite both in Spain and in the north

124
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,870
and southern shores of Mediterranean the

125
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:41,960
first diplomatic

126
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:45,950
relation between Shia while share

127
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:49,880
between Persia sari and France and thus

128
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,889
Europe date from 1750 three hundred

129
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,440
years ago

130
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:56,360
scholars in French Academy for example

131
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,730
have been studying Arabic for fund on

132
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,190
almost four hundred years in college of

133
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:04,940
Hans and in so on so it's not a new

134
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:08,389
issue what is new is the fact that it is

135
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:12,080
willing force well we rephrase that some

136
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:13,400
having some have a political agenda more

137
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,680
than a cultural and civilizational

138
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,929
gender and I think this is not a threat

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,169
but something we have to address in

140
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:23,660
another way yeah I'm just curious you

141
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:25,700
know why now alia forces perhaps behind

142
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,430
it you know for a very long time we had

143
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:31,849
lived without the threat of political

144
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:34,370
Islam well there's definitely an agenda

145
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,639
again and a political agenda with some

146
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,250
states using that religious diplomacy

147
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,610
everyone knows that KSA Kingdom Saudi

148
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:46,700
Arabia has engaged a certain number of

149
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,800
money in such a number of actions and

150
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,340
taking a certain number of actions on

151
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,320
that behalf there is a momentum in which

152
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,289
states are using more and more proxy

153
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,570
actors to fulfill this agenda this is

154
00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:01,520
true with s bola with Iran this is true

155
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:05,450
maybe with the Muslim Brotherhood

156
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:09,349
with link to of course historical is

157
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:12,110
directly to al banner but again

158
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,930
something we can find not only in Egypt

159
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:18,530
but in other the southern part of

160
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,169
dimension so it's a new agenda again

161
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,260
that we have been not been addressing in

162
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:26,590
a correct way we have addressing it in a

163
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:29,300
security process we're not trying to

164
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:33,228
understand that the dynamics inside the

165
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,959
Muslim society are the same that Europe

166
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,690
has experienced a thousand years ago

167
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:41,569
between the difference of modernizing

168
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:45,410
Islam or Islamic Islamization of

169
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,510
modernity we did we lived this during

170
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,469
the Renaissance period in Europe when

171
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,250
with the reform we interrogated what was

172
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,550
faith

173
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,779
and what was in france' we say reason I

174
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,160
don't know if you translate that in

175
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:07,430
English but you believe or you act and

176
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:09,800
this is quoi oh you agree only in you to

177
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,689
govern so this I think as not

178
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,269
sufficiently two peoples have been

179
00:09:11,689 --> 00:09:16,910
addressed as something that we have

180
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:20,930
experienced in Europe and which is I

181
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:23,540
think now transversing a certain number

182
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,870
of societies this was quite true just

183
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,599
after the as a milestone one of the

184
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,850
milestones of their offspring in 2011

185
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,160
and what is happening now in Algeria and

186
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,829
Sudan that I think we could go back on

187
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,949
that issue afterwards doctor area um

188
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:41,449
it's interesting to know what is exactly

189
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:43,550
is happening because we have seen

190
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:46,399
especially at least based on the

191
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,149
documents that the ISIS has been

192
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,879
producing they tend or at least they

193
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:56,720
claim to extend their Caliphate way

194
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:58,339
beyond the Levant we've seen Boko Haram

195
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,970
we've seen al-shabaab on the other end

196
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:05,269
and you know parts of the former Soviet

197
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,920
Union we've seen them in check near what

198
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:10,309
is happening what is driving what's the

199
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,319
nervous driving these groups thank you

200
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:15,559
so much a chair I would like to start

201
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:18,649
from the point that when Isis when a

202
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:20,660
Bakr al Baghdadi in in a couple of years

203
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,490
back declared that he has established a

204
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,949
Caliphate and self-appointed himself as

205
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,930
the as the first caliph after the fall

206
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:29,319
of the caliph of the fall of the Ottoman

207
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,519
Empire during the Second World War

208
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:34,250
40,000 people from all over the world

209
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,660
turned up to join this Caliphate what

210
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,660
does this really mean about the

211
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:42,050
political nature of of Muslim committees

212
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:44,209
across the world but perhaps we we need

213
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,859
to understand this aspiration among

214
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:48,579
certain constituencies perhaps even

215
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,430
better than Europe how the vision

216
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:54,769
governance structure should be so we saw

217
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:58,420
hundreds and hundreds of Europeans from

218
00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:01,699
all over turning up to be part of this

219
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,620
the thing that we we need to also put

220
00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:06,019
into perspective is the nature of the

221
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,209
states in which Muslims live especially

222
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:09,739
outside Europe these crisis of steps

223
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,089
states are not necessarily functioning

224
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:13,279
the way they are they're not necessarily

225
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:15,220
democratic enough or those who live

226
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,420
within Europe feel as if they're

227
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,489
disenfranchised they don't feel they

228
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,569
feel probably there are cultural aspects

229
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:22,790
are not necessarily captured within

230
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:25,368
within the secular system they live in

231
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:28,129
so they aspire to live in pious system

232
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:30,410
that sorts of appear to you know apply

233
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:33,649
the Islamic tenets to the very limit but

234
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,999
of course behind groups like Isis behind

235
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,699
groups like al-shabaab behind groups

236
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:40,189
like al-qaeda religion is generally

237
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:42,439
instrumentalized for political end it's

238
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:46,879
a new form of statecraft that is at play

239
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:48,679
largely that sits opposite to today the

240
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,619
new liberal state that we have across

241
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,329
the world and so when you look at the

242
00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:55,610
experience of political Islam using

243
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:57,378
currently there are a couple of

244
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,910
countries perhaps that are experimenting

245
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:02,209
with different form of stamina for say

246
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,929
say turkey or or Egypt under mostly

247
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:07,910
mercy or some parties for instance in in

248
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:11,869
Middle East or in in in Tunisia like an

249
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:14,329
enact and so on so it is quite a vast

250
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:16,339
expression of what political Islamism is

251
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:18,469
and is that it's a mixed bag of success

252
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:20,059
and failure for instance in the case of

253
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,759
Egypt for instance despite the fact that

254
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:24,049
this person was elected on some kind of

255
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:30,290
popular popular

256
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:32,480
legitimate what he couldn't inclusively

257
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,639
administer the country enough for it to

258
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,559
be for it to be considered as one unit

259
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,019
so we see crisis continuously also

260
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,819
appearing within different

261
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:44,660
experimentation of Islamism so I could

262
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:46,399
put it that now we have seen some states

263
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,230
have been accused of sponsoring some of

264
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,169
this organization says you know state

265
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:53,720
sponsor of terror to what extent and are

266
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:57,049
there any states that come to mind that

267
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,779
perhaps are contributing to the growth

268
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:02,689
and expansion of these groups it's a a

269
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:04,850
very shady area to actually you know put

270
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:07,309
a finger into who will actually be

271
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,449
sponsoring states to terrorism for

272
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:10,910
instance Sudan has been for a long

273
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:12,889
period associated with the sponsor of

274
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,660
terrorism and we saw the sanction that

275
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:17,780
were placed on them for over twenty

276
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:21,800
years because they hosted

277
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:24,230
al-qaeda's chief Osama bin Laden for a

278
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,449
couple of years and so these functions

279
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,950
were placed on them so though these are

280
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,630
very political statements that are used

281
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,580
by the world powers especially to

282
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,230
sanction instead that affiliated in one

283
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,200
or rather with radical Asian terrorism

284
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,330
but Muslims did Muslim majority state

285
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,890
especially in the Middle East or tacky

286
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,270
and so on are interested in migrant

287
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:42,890
communities that are living in Europe in

288
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,400
one way or another and they have either

289
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,080
you know support for most communities or

290
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,939
oscillations that continuously look back

291
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,760
at home countries as examples from which

292
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,940
they could borrow Islamic ideas oh I

293
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,280
think mana would like I don't want you

294
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,470
to pinpoint for space precisely the

295
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,510
state that you're mentioning that the

296
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,210
ideology that is fueling a certain

297
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:08,360
number of these groups go back to the

298
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:14,180
end of the 80s and precisely the

299
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:17,420
expansionism the will to try to convert

300
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,500
a certain number of Muslim states who

301
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:23,449
were living under for example Sufi

302
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,690
legitimacy or Sufi history I'm thinking

303
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:29,750
of West Africa have been under pressure

304
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:32,480
by an ongoing and very diplomatic

305
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,370
strategy of accept expansion valve

306
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,520
recently which is a reality I'm not

307
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,920
saying not pushing on one state but

308
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:43,040
again we do know where it is it has

309
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,050
started and how this state is amplifying

310
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,449
all that but that is true that there has

311
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:51,849
been a certain number of social pressure

312
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:55,760
a sort of will to use civil society

313
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,970
charities and zeros to try to change

314
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,780
narrative that is not having a national

315
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:05,630
agenda but an imagined on agenda coming

316
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,550
from abroad I'm not saying that has

317
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:12,200
fueled a certain number of insurgency

318
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:15,079
charge groups or irreligious militias

319
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,590
but again there is a sort of chronology

320
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,610
a link between chronology and that

321
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:26,519
relative

322
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:36,809
I know tomato what is the relationship

323
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:42,319
between I think you'll need your

324
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:42,319
translation kids from arabic to english

325
00:15:54,619 --> 00:16:02,189
so what what is what do you think is the

326
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,819
relationship between Islam and political

327
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:06,360
Islam

328
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:09,719
are there certain Islamic precepts that

329
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,869
perhaps are informing the actions of

330
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:22,709
political Islam or extremist ideology

331
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:25,470
for instance yeah um I was I was asking

332
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:32,790
Eve are there any Islamic precepts

333
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:36,179
within the Quran for instance you idea

334
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:39,480
in Islamic precepts within the Quran

335
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:41,429
that perhaps are informing the actions

336
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,279
and the direction of political Islam and

337
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:46,379
extremist ideology I think a lot of

338
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,669
people around the world sometimes wonder

339
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,519
where the exactly a connection

340
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:53,689
inherently between Islam and for

341
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,689
instance terrorism and extremism

342
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:15,388
what is the channel yeah yeah I think

343
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,829
yeah it's working now that's what

344
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:19,079
technology does sometimes it means

345
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:22,948
behaves at the most inopportune time

346
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:25,260
yeah the question the question

347
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:28,559
gusano that you can help us perhaps in

348
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,260
walk us through is is there a

349
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,908
relationship between Islam and the rise

350
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,139
of political Islam is there something

351
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:38,580
inherent within Islam that informs the

352
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:54,209
rise of this ideology and political

353
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:56,250
Islam yes we yes I think as we still

354
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:03,809
work out the technology bit we're gonna

355
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:07,380
move into you know Iman yes so it yeah

356
00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:11,070
is there anything inherently within

357
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:14,690
Islam that perhaps is informing the

358
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:22,439
actions of terrorist organizations and

359
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:23,929
political Islam well I think we'll come

360
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,399
back to that later

361
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:34,950

00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:54,840

for us but but I have a question for you

472
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:50,129
man well we've seen what is happening in

473
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:53,280
increasingly in Europe you have a lot of

474
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,380
young men and women crossing over to go

475
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:59,810
to the Middle East you know to fight in

476
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:03,930
jihad for whatever cause they think oh

477
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:05,790
what are we doing to in Europe to make

478
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:09,090
sure that we actually reduce this

479
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:11,970
problem of extremists recruiting from

480
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:14,850
home you know you find different kids

481
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,290
who have you know access to education

482
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,209
come from middle-class families but they

483
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,070
still find themselves in there and they

484
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,930
comes problematic for us to get them

485
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:23,970
back because we don't know exactly what

486
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,950
we're dealing with what do you think

487
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:28,140
Europe should do to make sure that this

488
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,450
problem does not continue first of all

489
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:34,620
it's not a problem only that your pastor

490

498
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:57,360
mentioned it frequently so it's not only

499
00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:00,240
a problem about Europe secondly I think

500
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,899
the problem is not saying that they go

501
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,960
to Syria or they went to Syria to Iraq

502
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,670
more recently to Libya and more agency

503
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,320
in Afghanistan for social reasons

504
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,450
because they're not integrated and

505
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,120
because Europe has not mentioned or not

506
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:17,460
another Matt has not managed to

507
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,929
integrate all of the communities I do

508
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,850
prefer communities more than etnies

509
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,980
there is no at least in France there is

510
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:26,429
no community by the way but that's

511
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:30,330
another another question so the issue I

512
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:32,490
think I wanted to raise that after the

513
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,740
intervention of a colleague it because a

514
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,740
certain number of European countries not

515
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,100
to say the United States have I think

516
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,980
thoughts in the outskirts of the rav

517
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,649
Springs that political Islam was the

518
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:50,610
worst solution because they were fearing

519
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,590
that if they were not sustaining on they

520
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,649
would not sustain political Islam

521
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:58,439
parties and this is quite true in

522
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,050
Tunisia with the race of another as you

523
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,790
know Canoe she made his studies in Great

524
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:06,060
Britain and has a certain number of

525
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:08,490
contacts with American scholars in NYU

526
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:10,470
and in Fordham University in New York I

527
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,860
think a certain number of country and

528
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,870
again I will speak more precise on my

529
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,810
country I thought that sustaining

530
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:21,689
political Islam was a solution in order

531
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:25,409
to prevent this state to go and to shift

532
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:28,200
to violent extremism not saying we made

533
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,210
a mistake on that but again this is this

534
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,090
was the narrative between 2010 and 2011

535
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,790
and this was a narrative by the way with

536
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,500
a certain number of Maghreb countries

537
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:40,320
for example when there was a change of

538
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,250
constitution in Morocco in 2011 which

539
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,889
saw the rise of the PGD justice and

540
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:49,320
democracy party the divan country which

541
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:51,120
is still in power that was one of the

542
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,080
responses that the King Mahmoud six

543
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:58,050
thought was convenient not the same

544
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,689
response in Nigeria when the feasts and

545
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:03,659
now the MSP would not were pushed aside

546
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:08,070
even though they want direction in 1990

547
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:10,080
and 91 so I think this is very important

548
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,320
to address maybe your question saying

549
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,710
it's not about Islam it's about

550
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,649
political agenda again people went in

551
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,620
Syria not based on the fact that they

552
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:25,550
were doing a jihad but based on the fact

553
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,810
that they were pushing again for a

554
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:31,500
geopolitical agenda and this is quite

555
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:35,100
true maybe true maybe in Libya where

556
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:39,410
there is no absolutely no religious

557
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:42,419
essence in the fact that - is becoming -

558
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:45,990
even though it has pushed it been pushed

559
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,190
already in 2016 and Libyan shows so

560
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:48,960
political agenda then there's a

561
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:52,130
geopolitical agenda we already mentioned

562
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,820
that based on the fact that now I see

563
00:29:52,130 --> 00:30:02,850
coming a new political agenda we are now

564
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:05,639
in post-revolutionary starts mosy is no

565
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,740
longer in power in Egypt so the

566
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,560
Brotherhood was put aside Muslim

567
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,320
Brotherhood would put aside in Egypt

568
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:15,389
another even though as not is not in

569
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,570
power but still represent 36

570
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:20,130
40% of the electoral votes in Tunisia

571
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:23,090
which is important because as you all

572
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:26,010
know her knew she his chief has said

573
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:28,049
three days ago that he will be running

574
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:31,110
for the presidency by the end of the

575
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:34,260
year and in Algeria and maybe more in

576
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:36,899
Sudan we see that this is again becoming

577
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,570
more and more an agenda the people who

578
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:44,370
went on the streets was saying three

579
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:46,500
things liberty civil rights no sharia we

580
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,469
don't want Sisi and you we don't want

581
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,750
external angels in stone enter Frances

582
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,600
this is exactly what happened again in

583
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:56,460
Mali and again maybe I can address and

584
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,590
respond precisely to a question how do

585
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:01,230
we address the fact that a certain

586
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:05,070
number of French born French one to

587
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:08,309
fight in Syria and Libya well first of

588
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:12,570
all we have to address the fact that a

589
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:15,030
certain number of French citizen have

590
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:17,549
not had the impression that they were

591
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:20,730
equal to right and didn't have the same

592
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:24,020
access to what the Republic was giving

593
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:27,120
him maybe to be precise her on this

594
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,668
there is no statistic no religious no

595
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,189
ethnic statistic in France so we don't

596
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:34,530
know precisely who is Muslim and with

597
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,299
not Muslim it would be discriminatory to

598
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:38,700
say you are Muslim because you come from

599
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:43,799
Algeria they may not be Muslim they may

600
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:48,419
not be petitioner we think that only 6%

601
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:50,790
of the French population is linked to

602
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,720
Islam by history and not by practice of

603
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:57,360
religion so that would make more or less

604
00:31:53,720 --> 00:32:00,450
something like 6 to 7 million Muslim in

605
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:04,110
France they are French French national

606
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:07,440
but practicing Islam but among the six

607
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:10,280
million only 1.5 million are believers

608
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,770
and practitioners of the religion so

609
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:16,389
again pushing aside the

610
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:20,360
[Music]

611
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:22,789
religious aspects and I think one of the

612
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:27,408
comparison which is a cute is saying

613
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:30,730
that in some cases religion not saying

614
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:33,110
Islam religion can be a sort of

615
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:36,200
replacement of what the state does not

616
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:39,770
do we have the phenomenon of center and

617
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,650
porphyria all of these terrorists

618
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:46,370
irredentist militias guerrilla groups

619
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:49,400
grow in areas very far from the

620
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:51,260
administrative centers of this country

621
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,990
that means that the states as we've

622
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:57,260
drawn and when the state withdrawn it

623
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:59,600
happened in 1950s in Italy in Sicilia

624
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,850
when someone replaces that criminal

625
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,500
organization I think we have turning

626
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,389
that not to religious but to the fact

627
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,669
that when the state is not there

628
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:10,250
you have someone willing to push aside

629
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:14,510
the state and replace it after justice

630
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:17,929
of work capability and of course offer a

631
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,370
political future I'm not sure I respond

632
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:22,970
to your question but I think this is

633
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,590
important well tonight thank you oh well

634
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:28,280
I was just wondering

635
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:30,918
we know how religion ization of politics

636
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,980
and politician of religion what it can

637
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:36,890
do especially with regard to coexistence

638
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:40,970
and harmony now in the light of what is

639
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,679
happening today in our current world we

640
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,179
also understand especially those who

641
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:46,190
practice in the field of countering

642
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:49,400
violent extremism that moderate voices

643
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:52,789
are very important in the fight against

644
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,890
extremism now from your experience what

645
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:57,559
do you think Europe should do especially

646
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:00,409
in empowering moderate voices especially

647
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,809
of its Islamic leaders and they even

648
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:04,940
doing enough our Islamic leaders

649
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:07,820
actually doing enough to fight back

650
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,619
against the terrorists narrative I will

651
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,190
borrow some examples from Africa in this

652
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:16,580
case Kenya's case Kenya neighbours

653
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:20,980
Somalia Somalia has been as failed state

654
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:23,929
since since 1991 and by 2005 the

655
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,969
Warlord's you know Islamic state you

656
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:28,099
caught Union are taken off a Shabaab

657
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:29,290
rose in this power vacuum that my

658
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,750
colleague has also discussed

659
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:34,330
when the state is no longer working well

660
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:38,429
especially in this part of the world

661
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:40,509
chances of individuals ganging up and

662
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:43,120
instrumentalizing religion for purpose

663
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:46,389
of building a new form of state polity

664
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,100
is extremely possible now the question

665
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,070
now arises two issues of moderate

666
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,839
leaders there's been experimentation

667
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:55,419
across the world for instance of voices

668
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,810
that alternatives the ones of of say

669
00:34:55,418 --> 00:35:02,080
al-qaeda or Islamic state one of the

670
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:04,529
biggest crisis that faces these forms of

671
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,340
voices is legitimacy are they

672
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:09,640
individuals that are considered

673
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:12,130
considerably across the swath of Europe

674
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,080
as individuals who can give directions

675
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,850
that will be followed by the youth when

676
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,950
youth especially young people take

677
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,110
positions that are contrary to those of

678
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,490
both the state in which they live and

679
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,190
deliciously does that lead their

680
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:26,500
communities they are often inclined not

681
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,210
to listen to this kind of moderation but

682
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,740
by and large despite the fact that these

683
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,350
voices might not be listened to they

684
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,629
need to be supported the experience for

685
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,960
instance from Kenya is and and East

686
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:39,400
Africa is that when these campaigns that

687
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,680
are usually called counting when

688
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:44,560
extremism involves the communities

689
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,200
better chances of this agenda being

690
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:51,279
accepted across by many stakeholders is

691
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,930
extreme is a strong so if the a

692
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,130
legitimacy is good enough if they also

693
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:56,200
reach it enough to give directions

694
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:58,720
within their societies if they do not

695
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:01,330
also engage in exclusion of other voices

696
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,060
within their own Sarkis perfect but

697
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:05,350
getting such groups of individuals is

698
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,790
something that needs to be natural with

699
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:09,220
in individual countries rather than

700
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:12,640
across Europe because say someone who'll

701
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,529
enjoy extreme position extreme position

702
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,990
of authority say in a Netherlands or in

703
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:19,170
Germany or in France and these voices

704
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,399
need to be nurtured as country-specific

705
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,410
voices that are going to guide

706
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,230
communities up towards the path of

707
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:30,879
moderation and and and fighting world

708
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:33,730
extremism in addition whether it is real

709
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,860
or not those perceived grievances that

710
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,500
individual cite as reasons for going to

711
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,690
join violent extremist group must be

712
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,460
addressed by society and must

713
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:44,170
volve much more of communities

714
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,970
themselves than state security agencies

715
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:49,359
or any other partner that is seen as

716
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:54,220
alien by these communities and I think

717
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:57,339
to to to to finalize examples need to be

718
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,270
borrowed within within Europe and people

719
00:36:57,339 --> 00:37:00,009
need to learn from each other's

720
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:02,530
experiences on how to erase this thank

721
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:05,710
you thank you very much for that

722
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:08,290
contribution I perhaps 30 seconds I want

723
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,560
you to address that in another way the

724
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:13,480
problem we have concerning the

725
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,869
intermediate forces what we call in

726
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,060
French system the Lumia moderate Islam

727
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:21,430
it's just a question of institution

728
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,799
there's no such thing as clericalism in

729
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:26,859
soon ism so who is the legitimate and

730
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,829
was not legitimate is director of Inasa

731
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:33,759
the oldest university in the world in

732
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:36,910
muslim wat 1053 created the same day as

733
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,130
Cairo was created is related to MIT in

734
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:41,700
the new Egyptian Constitution he has a

735
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,680
rank of Prime Minister so he is

736
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:47,828
institutionally legitimate not only

737
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:50,500
frigid for a certain number of Sunni now

738
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:52,480
the question is also can be raised with

739
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,960
the king of morocco because the king of

740
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,349
morocco is the commander of the faithful

741
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,740
again he has a legitimacy not only in as

742
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:05,710
king of the saturation of a cross with a

743
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:07,930
certain number of political and

744
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:11,500
historical legitimacy coming from

745
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:13,660
morocco and having spread throughout the

746
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,579
18th century in western in western in

747
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:18,609
western africa the question is very

748
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:20,829
acute in france by the way what we have

749
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:22,930
we are raising this question to whom do

750
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:25,060
we speak who is legitimate

751
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:27,149
are you legitimate because you have a

752
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:29,799
mosque where you have a lot of faith

753
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:33,690
believers while you legitimate because

754
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:40,300
you have worked on a certain number of

755
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:44,470
issues certain number of certain number

756
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:46,660
of academic and academic works and the

757
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,640
question that was addressed in France

758
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:53,049
was addressed in the wrong world wrong

759
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,930
way sorry we decided that someone who

760
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,470
had in

761
00:38:53,930 --> 00:39:00,049
musk a certain number of believers per

762
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:04,098
square meters were legitimate I think we

763
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:06,890
missed the point and again to address in

764
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:10,550
one face there is a beginning of

765
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:13,609
something on which we can work on the

766
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:15,829
Council of Muslim elders in which you

767
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:18,589
have political leaders as well as

768
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:21,829
religious leaders not only Muslim but

769
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:24,740
from all of the three religion the three

770
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:27,170
sacred religion a revealed region and

771
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:30,529
they are working very actively to create

772
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:33,829
an agenda places where one can speak to

773
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:38,710
the other and of utmost importance to

774
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:41,359
have a linkage with States and

775
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,339
international organization that is to

776
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:45,650
say we are speaking a lot about

777
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:48,650
multilateralism I think we should speak

778
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,690
more about purely real as proven is

779
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,220
imperialism inside the international

780
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,319
order we're in a certain number of

781
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:56,058
international organization were not to

782
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:58,130
keep taking sufficiently in

783
00:39:56,059 --> 00:40:00,859
consideration the fact that maybe the

784
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,440
leadership is not only state-owned it

785
00:40:00,859 --> 00:40:08,029
can be locally owned it can be religious

786
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:11,750
driven it can be motivated by something

787
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:13,670
else then state ownership thank you um I

788
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,670
think at this stage I would like to take

789
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,650
some questions from our audience we're

790
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:23,020
gonna do gentleman lady gentleman lady

791
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:23,020
or boy girl boy girl just to be fair

792
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:31,339
gentleman right there thank you very

793
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,440
much to the speakers my name is Otto

794
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:38,029
Norman from Keele University and have a

795
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,309
question - Emmanuelle I'm wondering we

796
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,750
spoke about the legitimacy that we have

797
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:44,960
had on the panel who is really

798
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:47,869
legitimate and so when I think about the

799
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,049
question of legitimacy I'm want to ask

800
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:54,319
you man well how do you consider the use

801
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:57,650
of the word anti-muslim racism the use

802
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,920
of racism when used for people rejecting

803
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:04,190
sort of Islamic or Muslim ideas and

804
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:07,549
religion if we consider that sort of who

805
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:08,450
is really legitimate to speak for the

806
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,849
Muslim world

807
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:13,310
is that word in your mind appropriate

808
00:41:10,849 --> 00:41:16,070
because if I have race I cannot change

809
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:19,040
my race but obviously I can choose a

810
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:21,020
religion at least in in our country and

811
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,089
here you can do that so should that word

812
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,300
racism be continued to be used or is

813
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:28,670
that probably it's also weaponization of

814
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:31,690
words thank you very much thank you

815
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,690
another question

816
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:41,150
any other question so they can respond

817
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,420
to two questions at a time please yes of

818
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:47,300
course you're totally right I think we

819
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:50,480
are putting sort of buzzwords when it

820
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,220
comes to Islam for example we have a

821
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,160
tendency to not make a difference

822
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,868
between orient and Islam forgetting that

823
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,819
in audience you have a lot of minorities

824
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:00,710
a lot of religious minorities the

825
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:05,119
Christians and are one of them of course

826
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:07,240
the cops in Egypt and in Sudan I think

827
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,000
you're raising a question that is

828
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,618
something that the politicians have not

829
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,619
been capable or not willing to address

830
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:18,010
during the last years as I mentioned the

831
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:21,710
fact that a certain number of people

832
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:22,940
again I will focus on France a Muslim

833
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,300
but they were coming

834
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,390
more than Muslim state from states which

835
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:33,589
was under the French rule Algeria Colony

836
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:35,210
etc and so when you speak to them the

837
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:37,480
immense majority do not consider

838
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:40,550
themselves a Muslim there is a minority

839
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,750
which say that in France they are Muslim

840
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:47,119
they are they consider themselves

841
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:50,599
primarily Algerians Tunisian morocco or

842
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,880
Franco Argentina's America but again

843
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,830
there is a sort of narrative which a

844
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,099
certain number of parties are using I

845
00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:00,560
think it is the same narrative that must

846
00:42:58,099 --> 00:43:04,460
be fought against when it comes to

847
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:08,060
fighting against radicalism on one side

848
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:10,609
and populism on the other sometimes they

849
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,930
are the same it is the same Dreiser's we

850
00:43:10,609 --> 00:43:13,910
should advance a world

851
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:15,589
you're right saying it's not about

852
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:22,700
racism it's

853
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:23,900
in I say we ante Islamophobia for

854
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,910
example this is what the world were

855
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,740
using in France it's very contradictory

856
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:32,930
contradictory but this is the world were

857
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:37,640
using and to wrap up my my response and

858
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:39,799
give you a bit of a perspective I did

859
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,890
mention the fact that one of the reasons

860
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,740
why Islam is not considered sufficiently

861
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:48,109
integrated as core of the European

862
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:50,060
tradition maybe we can address that

863
00:43:48,109 --> 00:43:53,720
question because a part of Europe is

864
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:56,210
Muslim Bosnia is Muslim Albania is

865
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,759
Muslim and there are 1 million

866
00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:01,190
point-five Turks in Germany they will

867
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,200
present something I mean they have a

868
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,560
voice because they are Turkish and

869
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,480
Germans and again they are not voting

870
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,790
because they are Muslim or linked to out

871
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,119
the gun they're voting because they feel

872
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:15,740
they can be represented by someone or

873
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,540
another one I think we're not

874
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:24,098
sufficiently addressing the issue of the

875
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:28,029
change of the sociology of our societies

876
00:44:24,099 --> 00:44:31,010
no society no longer is unique cultural

877
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:33,760
each society everywhere in the world is

878
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,560
multicultural cultural cultural

879
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,420
so this is a question that the

880
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,000
politicians should address when speaking

881
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:43,480
to a certain of people a certain casual

882
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:46,550
people do not feel sufficiently French

883
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:51,440
then there is the question of

884
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:55,900
reciprocity we are not interfering in

885
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:59,180
the political or religious affairs of

886
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,070
some countries and one of the reason why

887
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,649
there is this form of racism as sources

888
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:07,010
of antagonism with the Muslim is because

889
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:10,820
a certain number of countries are using

890
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:15,380
that open door this backdoor to have an

891
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:17,260
agenda both Turkey and Algeria in France

892
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:21,339
which are running the most mosques

893
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:25,280
Marseille for turkey and Paris the

894
00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:27,410
oldest mosque in in Paris 1924 the gone

895
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,130
mostly the time so this is important

896
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:31,859
this is how France for example

897
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,960
addressing the question saying that when

898
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:37,308
it comes to the creation of Islam the

899
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,539
force there's two pillars on that

900
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:43,500
organizational as I mentioned we need

901
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:46,769
someone to speak with and of course the

902
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:50,460
question of the Kapus capacity of having

903
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:55,049
Republic and Islam being totally

904
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:58,710
compatible Quran cannot reform or cannot

905
00:45:55,049 --> 00:46:00,809
replace a constitution or a citizenship

906
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,990
citizenship that is what I call

907
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:08,130
reciprocity I think you know now even

908
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:09,930
fact working with moderate voices can

909
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:13,650
advance the cause of addressing

910
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:15,750
extremism how are we supporting moderate

911
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:18,839
voices especially Islamic voices in

912
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,700
Europe to ensure especially in the light

913
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:23,160
of increased Islamophobia in some

914
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,598
countries to ensure that we can coop

915
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,720
them into the process of countering

916
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,880
violent extremism and terrorist ideology

917
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,589
well there's two or three questions

918
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,619
inside your integration first question

919
00:46:31,589 --> 00:46:37,200
how can we address better already

920
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:39,930
addressing the moderate voices as for

921
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:44,609
example to bring them to power it's

922
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:47,970
again a problem of sort of medium range

923
00:46:44,609 --> 00:46:50,990
and I think this opens to another

924
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:54,058
question that we've been pinpointing all

925
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:56,879
during our debate the question between

926
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:57,450
the opposition between Shia for example

927
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,940
and tsarism

928
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,189
is not about religion it's based on the

929
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:05,430
fact that a certain number of countries

930
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:08,190
let's speak about the 19 million

931
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:12,328
inhabitants of Iran have gone to

932
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:16,349
revolution in 1979 where all of the

933
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:18,359
other Sunni countries except Iraq except

934
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:21,660
Syria we know what happened with Syria

935
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:24,509
and what happened with Iraq are not

936
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:27,058
molecules they are republics we may not

937
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:30,690
like the leadership of one or the other

938
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:32,640
we change we choose to change the regime

939
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,369
of the both but I think this is

940
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,089
important point it's again based on the

941
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:41,190
fact that when you want to address this

942
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,830
issue that the former president of meroe

943
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:44,290
of

944
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:49,450
of Tunisia massive Mizuki addressed very

945
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:52,570
well when he won the election in 2013 he

946
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:56,350
wanted to modernize Islam and not Islam

947
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:58,240
as a Islam besides modernity which is

948
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:00,279
something quite true because that is a

949
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,140
political agenda the other one is just

950
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:06,360
taking consideration that we are living

951
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:10,480
in a century where actors of changing

952
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:14,950
people are really assuming the fact that

953
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:17,260
they want to have community building I'm

954
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:19,779
not saying this Francis Fukuyama saying

955
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,480
this in his last

956
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,700
Anisa I said saying I was wrong thirty

957
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,120
years ago saying that it was the end of

958
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,029
history

959
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,310
no last man hand of history saying it is

960
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:33,580
the returns of ethics it is the return

961
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:37,090
of community but it is in a way a sort

962
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:39,310
of Democratic regression I like to take

963
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:46,540
