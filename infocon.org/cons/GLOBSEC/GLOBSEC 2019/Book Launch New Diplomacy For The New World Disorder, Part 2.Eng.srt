1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,500
the sake of timing I will just briefly

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,779
even though I will not do justice by

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,940
doing it briefly introduce the panelists

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,129
that are now in the second segment of

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,530
today's session

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,740
there are also members of the pin group

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,289
pin standing for the processes of

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,209
international negotiations and processes

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,750
of an international negotiations holds

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,900
yearly workshops and road shows as they

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,250
call them around the world in which they

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:32,668
disseminate their most cutting-edge

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,769
insights when it comes to processes of

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,078
negotiation and conflict management in

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,710
general it is my distinct pleasure to

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:44,430
introduce three pin members on my far

17
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,079
left is mark st from nelson mandela

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,539
university and many others in other

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,910
universities where he has had held

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,199
positions rudolf Schuessler from beirut

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,480
university in germany and Gili va4

22
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:00,120
professor from Sorbonne but also a

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,989
Globetrotter who is going to also

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,850
introduce us with his idea picking up

25
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,250
from the experiences that he has

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,710
collected around the world the topics

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,590
that the three panelists today are going

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,860
to cover and it can be summarized around

29
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,970
the dysfunctional democracies and how

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,700
identity politics are influencing this

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,729
dysfunctionality kin republicanism

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,880
provide some form of answer to the

33
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:34,619
current disorder and how to handle some

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:40,199
disobedience some rowdy actors on the

35
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:42,630
global level ie China so I would like to

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,090
start with Mark Antony who is going to

37
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,860
introduce us to his ideas on how

38
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,020
identity politics and dysfunctional

39
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:56,430
democracies go hand-in-hand I would say

40
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:57,949
good afternoon yes I took on this topic

41
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,270
foolishly

42
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:06,360
thinking I could address it in seven

43
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,048
minutes and started on much firmer

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,199
ground

45
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,150
I've lived in South Africa all my life I

46
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,179
was very actively participant in the

47
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:20,459
transition process where we moved from a

48
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:24,080
repressive minority rule to basically a

49
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:28,110
liberal democratic constitution and a

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,790
full-blooded system of human rights and

51
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,530
I now spend a fair amount of time in

52
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:38,120
England where I'm watching with great

53
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:42,110
interest brexit and both carry heavy

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,280
identity politics dimensions with them

55
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,920
and every time I think I've got a handle

56
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:54,180
on this I haven't because there are

57
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:55,738
other layers coming in so I can perhaps

58
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,300
respond to some of the questions you

59
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,819
asked Valerie from a South African

60
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:04,379
perspective and I'm still mediating

61
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,690
conflicts in South Africa in in ways

62
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,510
that attempt to address some of this had

63
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,200
to grow more grassroots level but let me

64
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:17,760
talk to the the bigger topic what makes

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,619
a democracy dysfunctional and we have

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,470
lists we we know a freedom house

67
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:29,159
produces annual reports of freedoms

68
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:33,360
across nations we have an estimate of

69
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,280
116 out of 186 nations that have been

70
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,470
investigated there to remain electoral

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,920
democracies but Freedom House believes

72
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,440
that democracies in a crisis so they're

73
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:47,129
not looking simply at the the small

74
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,250
robach that's occurred in the larger

75
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:52,500
definition of what an electoral

76
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,360
democracy as it's what's worrying them

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,590
is liberal democracy and the rollback of

78
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,680
freedoms

79
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,879
protections for minorities electoral

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,280
freedoms media freedoms rule of law

81
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,350
transparency and so on

82
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:18,390
and then what do we mean by identity

83
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:20,548
politics and people it's in my mind

84
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:24,210
simply how people define themselves and

85
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:27,419
then how they are mobilized who uses

86
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:30,780
that definition and pushes people into

87
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,600
or out of identity groups according to

88
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:38,520
larger political agendas and that will

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,620
take us into addressing shortly if if

90
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,169
our systems are dysfunctional and I'm

91
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,660
not entirely convinced there are because

92
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,270
things appear to be dissembling

93
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,950
disordered that is often the energy of

94
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:56,909
reek regenerating new systems telling us

95
00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:00,210
that there there is a breakdown underway

96
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:05,220
and if we are sensitive to it we have

97
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:07,560
time to reorder reshape regenerate the

98
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,610
worrying thing about all that is who

99
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,860
steps up to fill the space and so we

100
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,820
come back to a debate about leadership

101
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:22,080
and why the populist who are currently

102
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:26,010
on a on a surge seem to be better at

103
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,500
this in mobilizing support than existing

104
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:32,909
traditional mainstream politicians

105
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:35,940
operating within safe and time-honored

106
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,490
structures and in in saying that I must

107
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:43,640
tell you that when I've been looking at

108
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,640
this democracy is is new for all of us

109
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:52,590
it's it's even the old democracies full

110
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,830
democracy is a new practice and it has

111
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,830
produced

112
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:02,370
complications and issues that are far

113
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,980
away from the countries that I work in

114
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,200
now that are aspiring to democracy and

115
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,340
think it's a point of arrival somehow

116
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:15,830
rather than a system of in my mind that

117
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,830
is designed for ongoing problem solving

118
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:23,280
you in Phase one you are designing a

119
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,740
system that will give credibility to

120
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,830
leadership's and to problem solving

121
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:32,160
systems and then their systems actually

122
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,590
have to keep delivering to the people

123
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,100
that put them there and in there like

124
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,640
complications so we arrived in democracy

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,860
late

126
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,870
we arrived across the world of

127
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,290
completely different historical

128
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:50,120
trajectories the West had a particular

129
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:53,480
trajectory worked out through blood on

130
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,190
what a liberal democracy might look like

131
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,800
other nations arrived through

132
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:01,320
trajectories of colonialism long term

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,230
repression and a development in

134
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:07,770
completely different contexts and in n

135
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:11,850
different shape so economically

136
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:14,549
culturally in terms of tradition and

137
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:17,540
narrative forms of governments have come

138
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,250
through completely different

139
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,420
trajectories and then we arrived and

140
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,380
we've got a sort of one package fits all

141
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,290
when I look at Europe

142
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,909
I see completely different a huge

143
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:35,730
diversity of diversity it's it's got

144
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:40,020
completely different mixes although we

145
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:43,669
use the term diversity the levels of

146
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:50,520
homogeneity heterogeneity are different

147
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:53,609
the and if nations are at four complexly

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,320
already heterogeneous and experiencing

149
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,890
problems I think that's a different

150
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:01,080
shape of democracy to debate to ones

151
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,280
which are seeking to protect their

152
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,280
existing homogeneity

153
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,170
you can see where I got confused I went

154
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:15,380
back to what did we want out of a

155
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:19,450
democracy and the search starts not for

156
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:22,580
human rights but for social order and

157
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,110
the need eventually to say look the only

158
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,349
way we're going to get social order is

159
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:30,230
through some kind of consensus of what

160
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,030
the rule should be and then we've got to

161
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,930
agree on who's going to exercise

162
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:37,880
authority for those consent and we've

163
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:41,030
got to have governments with capacity

164
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,880
and as we know the the great enemy of

165
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:46,280
democracy is poverty it removes the

166
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:54,500
capacity to deliver to citizens

167
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:56,810
effectively if we look at where the

168
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:02,270
national populist s-- are making ground

169
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:04,369
it's off a basis of fear we're in a

170
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,550
period of huge change climatically

171
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:10,580
security technology the list has already

172
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:19,310
been gone through by other speakers and

173
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:21,680
it generates an anxiety and the the sort

174
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,829
of common dialogue is that the system

175
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,709
has lost touch with the people the

176
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:31,460
coalition's that run currently can't be

177
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:33,920
trusted the systems that have been

178
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,630
designed are ineffective for the problem

179
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,010
solving for the problems of the future

180
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,600
um trust us we're against

181
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:47,650
multiculturalism we're against

182
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:50,000
immigration we are against globalization

183
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:52,459
but of course largely the people

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,930
mobilizing this haven't ever sat in

185
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,120
positions where they've had to engage

186
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,520
with these on a practical level they're

187
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,360
in mobilization mode rather than

188
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:05,660
delivery mode and some of the pushback

189
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,050
perhaps needs to come from if you're

190
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:13,750
dealing with pushback politics what what

191
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,750
do you need in order to respond to that

192
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,740
I'm going to just outline a couple of

193
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,449
things first credible leadership is

194
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,300
critical

195
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,330
the South African transition was managed

196
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,410
through through changing the narrative

197
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:33,780
from S&M to a joint nation-building

198
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:38,579
project and it required a particular

199
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:42,329
kind of leadership that mobilize people

200
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,300
to out of the past and interests into

201
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,910
structures for the future it's a it's a

202
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,130
stumbling and difficult transition

203
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:53,699
that's still a long way from being

204
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,920
finished and there are all kinds of new

205
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,040
identity problems because conflicts

206
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,110
mutate through time so credible

207
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,920
leadership the other thing that was

208
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,870
critical in our transition period was

209
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,579
civil society participation we didn't

210
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,370
just leave it to political leaders

211
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,990
people we created structures where

212
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:18,270
people would take ownership of and

213
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,870
responsibility for peaceful change on

214
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,870
the ground

215
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:29,250
these are grant missions of reshaping

216
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:32,400
culture and nation building begins with

217
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:35,340
reshaping culture and the tolerance is

218
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,709
the heart of what democracy is about and

219
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:47,130
it orders the shape of how you design

220
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:48,900
your systems I would say this once

221
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,120
you've gone that route you have to build

222
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,100
structures that support the change of

223
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,700
narrative the change of if you want

224
00:11:53,100 --> 00:12:00,090
attitude change and in the new in the

225
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,490
new world which is the longest in

226
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,910
democracy we have multiple identity

227
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,020
shapes things that are not of concern in

228
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,520
the developing world

229
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:13,860
now are busying the courts dispute

230
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:19,829
resolution mechanisms in in the

231
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,600
so-called first world if you want to fix

232
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:25,260
the problems of democracy the saying

233
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,180
goes more democracy if you want systems

234
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,529
of Tolerance you have to create systems

235
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,348
that enable tolerance

236
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:34,589
and provide certainty to people who are

237
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:38,149
in a crisis of uncertainty and then

238
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,149
finally I just want to say hold steady

239
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:47,429
we cannot go a route globally where

240
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:51,209
internal systems nurture intolerance

241
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:52,679
because internal systems even those

242
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:55,829
where you might have sympathy for saying

243
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:57,869
well let's keep those guys out there

244
00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:00,598
they're not democratic they're not going

245
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:03,089
to fit in our society but once you've

246
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:07,919
fingered an external group as being a

247
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:10,169
problem for your internal stability what

248
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:13,739
happens to the minorities that exist in

249
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:16,709
those nations already do they not is the

250
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:20,209
short step not next to discriminate

251
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:24,529
marginalize and isolate those groups so

252
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:28,199
only liberal democratic principles offer

253
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:30,929
protections to individual liberties and

254
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:35,189
minorities and it's not comfortable it's

255
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:41,369
hard work and it requires investment

256
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:44,098
across a wide spread of systems and and

257
00:13:41,369 --> 00:13:45,959
a bit of courage and it requires a

258
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:47,939
leadership that will step in and have

259
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,579
the courage to reshape the systems and

260
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:52,618
structures to the new shape of problems

261
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:55,368
that are developing and currently that

262
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:57,209
space seems to have been left to others

263
00:13:55,369 --> 00:14:00,949
thank you very much mark

264
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:03,419
in fact this gives a good segue to what

265
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:05,969
Rudolf is going to talk about whether or

266
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:07,859
not republicanism or a specific form of

267
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,829
democratic order can give an answer to

268
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:13,470
the world disorder that we're observing

269
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:16,409
today yeah I'm working very much on

270
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,689
similar problems as Marc I'm a political

271
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:21,269
philosopher so my considerations are a

272
00:14:18,689 --> 00:14:24,209
bit schematic and abstract but the first

273
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:26,459
thing is I don't see disruption right

274
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,669
now there is disruption on the horizon

275
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,679
it will be technical and it might be

276
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:34,978
worth changing but the transitions we

277
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,348
see are I think quite traditional and

278
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:39,329
the reasons we see for the traditions I

279
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:40,830
regard as quite traditional to you and

280
00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:42,420
that's where republicanism

281
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,340
comes in Republican thought is a very

282
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,920
old tradition of thought going back to

283
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,950
Greece and Rome and so why are the

284
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:54,050
problems we see related to it the point

285
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:57,480
is it our old problems of Republic's

286
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,160
coming up once more again now and have

287
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,350
been away for a while for different

288
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:05,040
reasons there have been a way because we

289
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:08,670
had bipolar world system in which we had

290
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,360
a totalitarian system against a state

291
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:15,240
led by a state which is a liberal

292
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,730
democracy so liberal democracy had the

293
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,760
advantage of being challenged and the

294
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:23,460
pressure under threat and everybody who

295
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,710
was interested in Liberty was rallying

296
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,220
around liberal democracy because it was

297
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:33,540
under totalitarian pressure this

298
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:35,640
situation fell away after 1990 and it

299
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,980
changed into a different situation in

300
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,870
which there was one superpower one

301
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,420
remaining superpower the liberal

302
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,510
democracy par excellence which tried to

303
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:49,050
spread in the 1990s its ideas its

304
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:51,660
liberal system over the world doing that

305
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:54,650
it challenged other countries other

306
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:57,930
cultures and it wasn't helping them to

307
00:15:54,650 --> 00:16:01,550
sustain their life under pressure but it

308
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:05,130
was trying to impose an idea of liberal

309
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:08,150
liberalism on them and republicanism is

310
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,710
very much about non domination that's a

311
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,689
quite modern understanding of

312
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,450
republicanism which has been around for

313
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,670
twenty thirty years now but if you focus

314
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,760
on non domination it makes clear that

315
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:24,000
the spread of liberal democracy has a

316
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,510
paradoxical side it liberates the

317
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,680
individuals but of course by dominating

318
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:35,310
their way of thought so if people have

319
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,250
an interest in their own liberty as non

320
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:40,410
domination internally in the state they

321
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,090
may also have an interest that their

322
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,040
state is not dominated by other states

323
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,770
that's the classical definition that's

324
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,189
what in Greece and Rome was part of

325
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:52,439
classical republicanism the state should

326
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,360
be strong enough due to the civic virtue

327
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,399
of the citizens to be

328
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,230
not dominated by other states that was

329
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,029
important for Athens and of course Rome

330
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,699
was strong enough to dominate others but

331
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:04,919
basically dominating others implies that

332
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:07,769
you first are not dominated by other

333
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,019
states so if your interest the interest

334
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:12,929
of the citizens is in their state not

335
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:15,679
being dominated as part of their civic

336
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:17,880
Liberty liberal democracy has a problem

337
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,069
liberal democracy has the problem that

338
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,769
if it is spread by violent means or by

339
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:24,480
missionary means that are not chiming in

340
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:27,299
with the culture in which it is

341
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,690
transported it becomes dominating over

342
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:32,460
the state and people might resist in the

343
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,899
interest of the Liberty as non

344
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,139
domination the spread of liberal

345
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:40,949
democracy question is does this happen

346
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:44,129
what we see in countries like Russia or

347
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:47,399
China at least partly might be explained

348
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:50,070
by their populations legitimizing the

349
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:52,590
rulers these people are not utterly

350
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,779
dissatisfied with the rulers and with

351
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,449
their lack of civic liberties because

352
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,159
they believe the rulers make sure their

353
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:02,309
country is not dominated by other

354
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:05,190
countries and in this way just serving

355
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:08,750
their Republican Liberty if you want to

356
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:14,159
overcome the situation will have to

357
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:16,320
understand that exclusive reliance on

358
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,389
liberal democracy and on the values of

359
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,090
liberal democracy will not bring us far

360
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:24,330
as long as the liberal democracy is not

361
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,610
able to be a global hegemon it will not

362
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,439
be able to overcome the interest of

363
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:32,250
different cultures and countries not to

364
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,409
be dominated we see this now in the

365
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:38,360
actual interactions between China and

366
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:40,500
the US and it's quite interesting that

367
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:44,279
traditional realism in the international

368
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,740
relations is not very fit to explain

369
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,779
what's happening because most of what is

370
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:53,370
happening is on the economic side not on

371
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:55,769
a military side so it's about economic

372
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,830
domination or becoming economic equal

373
00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:01,529
it's not about military equality this

374
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:06,149
was the main issue between Russia or

375
00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:07,860
USSR and the West it was a struggle for

376
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:11,040
military equality

377
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:15,199
or military superiority this was the

378
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:18,000
issue of realism it's no longer the case

379
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,210
the u.s. is ours economically too weak

380
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,820
to be a competitor to the US now we have

381
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,860
China which is militarily to be too weak

382
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,270
to be a competitor to the US but

383
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,719
economically strong enough to be an

384
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:32,790
economic competitor so the struggle

385
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,290
moves to the economic side that we'll

386
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:39,240
see attempt at domination and refusal of

387
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,159
domination or non domination on the

388
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,570
economic side so if we want to

389
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,510
understand this we have to move from

390
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:48,809
realism to republicanism or we have to

391
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:52,290
include Republican elements into ideas

392
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:54,059
of international order or realism and I

393
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:57,418
think if we do that we'll understand

394
00:19:54,059 --> 00:20:01,350
that we'll have to take care to look at

395
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:03,900
several very very specific points if you

396
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,428
want to avoid large-scale conflict in

397
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,510
the world order as it is and that

398
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:09,210
nothing of this has to do with

399
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:12,080
technology technological disruption it

400
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:16,500
has to do with shifting lines of

401
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:19,949
resources and trade from oil to rare

402
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:22,080
earth or coltan and other things so

403
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,419
different regions of the world will

404
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,990
become important and they had been

405
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:30,179
before and it has to do with attempts to

406
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,380
make sure that no country can be

407
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:35,669
economically dominated by other

408
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:38,820
countries and if this is done will might

409
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:41,700
have a chance to mitigate the conflicts

410
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,070
that are brewing nothing of this has

411
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,929
really to do with military superiority

412
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:48,240
because you don't need a strong military

413
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:51,150
and it doesn't help you necessarily what

414
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,250
you need is a adequately structured

415
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,530
economy that is resilient against

416
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,630
pressure from the outside or can exert

417
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:00,540
pressures in order to retain its

418
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,880
dominant dominance and the shift from

419
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:06,090
the military paradigm we had in the

420
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,410
bipolar world of the USSR u.s. conflict

421
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,689
to the economic and economic domination

422
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,330
paradigm is I think what we see on a

423
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,130
world level now and then there are lots

424
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,199
of conflicts which are simply a fall out

425
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,420
of this problem because the Middle East

426
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,430
becomes less important because

427
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,360
focus shifts from oil to other resources

428
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:31,650
because the Middle East is less

429
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:35,250
important to the world powers they just

430
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:40,110
have less interest in just mitigating or

431
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:42,450
freezing conflict there and if we follow

432
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:45,719
this line we might have a chance to

433
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,340
understand what is happening I think we

434
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,170
should do it quickly because I'm sure

435
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,570
the technological disruption which is

436
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,700
under Earth's horizon well catch up is

437
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,980
as soon in 1020 years and then we'll

438
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,900
have again a completely completely

439
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,590
different set of problems as robot wars

440
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,630
with probably artificial intelligence

441
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,699
involved in international politics and

442
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,560
things like that but what that's going

443
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,680
to be I don't know thank you for your

444
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,260
thank you very much true love last but

445
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,260
not least as the saying goes clearly via

446
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,990
for with the focus on China which has

447
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,750
been now sneaking into the conversation

448
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:25,290
sure it's in the mind of everybody I've

449
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,720
been working for 30 years on Chinese

450
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:31,560
issues and I want just to bring you

451
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,770
something that I believe essential to be

452
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:38,190
able to handle the relation to China in

453
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:41,340
a more effective way explore first the

454
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:44,070
Chinese mindset know and understand

455
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,399
China and after we can be far more

456
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:50,040
effective than if we start with our

457
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,620
mindset our values and we move on like

458
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:57,389
we do now which is of course the wrong

459
00:22:52,620 --> 00:23:01,409
way the cognitive map of the Chinese is

460
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:05,010
totally original and unique China in

461
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:07,680
Chinese is tong war which which in China

462
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,720
is the word we invented to call them but

463
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,990
it's never been cold like that Chum war

464
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,620
is a center of the world is the axis of

465
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,410
the world

466
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,409
it's the civilization I mean it means a

467
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:23,850
lot to them everything starts from that

468
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:25,950
and then there is today another element

469
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:29,939
that comes to the fore the hyper

470
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:33,390
patriotic stance territoriality is still

471
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,160
something essential vital to them and

472
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,880
more

473
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:40,620
I want to go quickly on one thing

474
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:43,049
historically speaking when we look at

475
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:47,370
China and the rest of the world it's

476
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:50,490
simple they expanded with a strategy

477
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:55,080
which is that of the oil spot they

478
00:23:50,490 --> 00:24:01,309
expand slowly touch upon other groups

479
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:04,770
other societies other nations and

480
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:08,190
explained I mean they churn them slowly

481
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:11,850
on because they have enough weight for

482
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:14,490
that as a tributary so there is a new

483
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,270
deal which is quite interesting which is

484
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,530
ok

485
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:22,770
China says we bring a lot of good to you

486
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:26,820
a lot of good we will have a great

487
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,570
benefit to interact with us but under

488
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,750
one condition

489
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:33,389
we are the boss so politically speaking

490
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:35,820
we are the leader we're there and you'll

491
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,669
benefit from it this is the the idea of

492
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:41,309
tributary I understand that today it's

493
00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:43,799
again going on this way except that they

494
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:46,408
cannot come here any more territory but

495
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,389
economically speaking they try to grab

496
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:51,059
as much of the resources of the world

497
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:53,039
which is rational in their own view and

498
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:55,530
according to their own needs they need

499
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,840
those resources they cannot expand they

500
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,090
cannot cultivate more rice in China they

501
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,389
cannot you know there's enough mind they

502
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:07,530
cannot discover new minds etc so they

503
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:11,039
this is typically what they do with the

504
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:15,299
the new silk road's abour is mad to do

505
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:19,400
that it's a modern way to expand with

506
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:24,480
the still the traditional mindset so a

507
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:28,980
word on the power issues China typically

508
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,049
tried to push as much as possible they

509
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:35,120
do it with the Spratly Islands they do

510
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:38,429
it with the Paracels with Buddha or in

511
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:43,260
Pakistan with Sri Lanka with Central

512
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:45,780
Asia etc but they are extremely

513
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,830
realistic they're not stupid with that

514
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:52,389
they know that they are weak

515
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:55,418
know that the this trench is not at all

516
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:59,730
something so important today to impose

517
00:25:55,419 --> 00:26:03,130
anything they're far behind the US on

518
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:04,899
hard and soft power they knows that very

519
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,690
well I discussed with the leaders there

520
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:09,389
and and and they extremely realistic but

521
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:12,970
the try they try as much as possible

522
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:16,090
they use very often rhetorics that go

523
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,659
far beyond what they really want and

524
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:22,000
they consider it as a smart way to

525
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:25,090
appear as important in the map of the

526
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:30,880
world and the political map they their

527
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:33,340
mindset is is clearly zero-sum game when

528
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,919
they negotiate they play zero-sum

529
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,779
because they understand in in their mind

530
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,260
it cannot be anything other than

531
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:45,279
zero-sum but again they know us very

532
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,279
well there have been well aware that we

533
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,799
love to hear will win we play win win

534
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,600
win win games etc so they repeat it I

535
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,879
mean if you discuss with Chinese they

536
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,269
every quarter of an hour they will drop

537
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,059
a win-win but that's it's just like

538
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:03,940
win-win is not in the mindset of any

539
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:06,428
Chinese win-win should be maybe the name

540
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:10,389
of a panda in a search one zoo that's

541
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:11,769
all and and then what we have is what

542
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:14,559
the player is you know

543
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:17,139
Sun Tzu strategies suits with strategy

544
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,629
the thirty-six stratagems etc I mean

545
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:22,719
they play tough they always have a

546
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:25,419
hidden agenda this is basic engine it's

547
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,210
not to be unpleasant is not to be tricky

548
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:31,659
it's in their culture you'd never play

549
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:35,470
direct you have to do it indirectly so

550
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:39,130
you never ask for what you want and and

551
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:42,309
you know opacity is really their zone of

552
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:45,850
comfort the Chinese what makes us so

553
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:47,889
awfully uncomfortable is fine to them

554
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,230
it's natural it's normal and they can

555
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:54,039
handle that beautifully with with some

556
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:56,380
of their tradition like Taoism etc I

557
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:59,408
want to say last thing about the

558
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,760
attributes they are extremely face

559
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,190
concerned

560
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,530
face is essential and we can play with

561
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:07,330
that in a moment I'm going to go to the

562
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,549
recommendations we can play a lot

563
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,428
because it has no cost to us and we can

564
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:16,480
achieve a lot of things with that so if

565
00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:19,600
we look at now at the world order or as

566
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,940
big Hartmann said it and I think it's

567
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,770
very strong and good and smart and and

568
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:27,460
accurate the World Disorder how to

569
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:32,650
handle this smartly this World Disorder

570
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:36,010
I would say we have a new cover ok with

571
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:38,169
a different history different methods of

572
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:42,790
handling problems and a different

573
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:46,150
cognitive map which is China ok so the

574
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:48,389
EU I discussed with them a lot is not a

575
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:51,070
threat for China it's not a big issue

576
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,799
they don't they consider the European

577
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:58,270
Union as fine but but there's not much

578
00:28:53,799 --> 00:29:01,240
to say but the US is a real counterpart

579
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:06,700
and the real competitor and I think the

580
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:09,549
US should definitely resist should draw

581
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,880
a red line somewhere

582
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:17,710
in many situations like I think about

583
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:21,669
the Spratly Islands etc and it's not

584
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:26,040
gonna be something that that's will harm

585
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:28,720
I think peace any longer China will go

586
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,470
escalating with rhetorics but only with

587
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,780
rhetorics they know how far they can go

588
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:37,510
they know their own limits they have a

589
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:40,059
lot of very important problem much more

590
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:41,950
than we believe china is still a

591
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,918
developing country it's a third world

592
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:47,230
country with a lot of domestic issues I

593
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:49,510
don't spend all my life in Beijing and

594
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:50,919
Shanghai I've been to 20 provinces

595
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,320
working there I've been in the

596
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,809
countryside I stayed even with farmers I

597
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,059
can tell you this is really the third

598
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:59,770
world this is an extremely poor country

599
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:02,700
they have so many problems to handle

600
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:07,540
that conquering the world is not really

601
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:10,059
their idea now ok then the Chinese

602
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:13,059
culture is typically terrorists which

603
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:14,059
means what harmony balance and the sense

604
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:16,668
of how

605
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:20,299
how far can we go without going too far

606
00:30:16,669 --> 00:30:22,669
but last not the least we must give

607
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:24,619
enough face to China and there'll be a

608
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:27,229
lot of benefits I want to conclude with

609
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:31,449
just a couple of recommendations the

610
00:30:27,229 --> 00:30:34,969
first one is do not escalate do not

611
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:38,899
demonize China either do not play might

612
00:30:34,969 --> 00:30:43,249
makes right as we said before do not try

613
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:44,658
to impose or to sell Western values we

614
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:48,019
think we are doing good

615
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:51,799
no it's really something that leads us

616
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:54,739
nowhere with the Chinese we have not

617
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:58,969
just to satisfy ourselves but but try to

618
00:30:54,739 --> 00:31:02,629
to to reach some result show limits show

619
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:05,330
firmness show the bottom line how far we

620
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:08,658
can go our selves the Chinese will

621
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:11,059
always push until they realize that this

622
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:12,830
is a there is a real bottom line so we

623
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:15,799
have to show it at some point and then

624
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:18,559
finally save Chinese face there's no

625
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:21,649
cost and it's essential for them and

626
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,499
then the relation will cool down for the

627
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:26,658
better thank you thank you very much

628
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:30,229
this brings us to the end of our panel

629
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:32,509

630
