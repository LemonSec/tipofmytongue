1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,089
little musical chairs for everyone there

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,620
we go

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:09,630
okay we all right

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,660
my name is Ben maku I am a national

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,890
security reporter with vice in New York

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,939
City I've covered terrorism now probably

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,650
since 2013 or so it's expanded to not

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,650
just include Isis in al-qaeda but I now

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,320
look at far right-wing terrorism white

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,198
nationalist neo-nazis which are also

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,570
emerging right now and this particular

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,520
panel will be about sort of the end of

13
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,040
the Caliphate or the territorial

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,309
holdings of Isis and what effect it's

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,120
going to have on terrorism in Europe and

16
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:49,890
in North America so we have Olivier Gita

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,019
from global strat Manuel navigate from

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:58,140
Europol Meredith Stryker joking Stricker

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:01,680
Meredith Stricker and Casper wreak havoc

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,099
from globe sack and sorry to say sorry I

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,950
missed you were from the SU fan group

22
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:11,339
Center so to start things off I want to

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,150
ask Manuel sincere with Europol what is

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,100
the threat facing Europe right now in

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,979
terms of the fall the Caliphate and what

26
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,140
are you saying I think right now that

27
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,270
you dope all along with the members to

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,939
be assessing if we have at the end of

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,280
the cycle I mean this phenomena also

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,669
call for literally fighters start in

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,060
2012-2013 they have a peak we speak

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,799
about security in 2015 to 16 and lately

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,110
thanks to the cooperation that we have

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,509
in this case in Euro at the maybe third

35
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,159
level is going down we reinforce

36
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,930
information exchange will for the

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,600
analysis and then we able to identify

38
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,090
earlier to detect this attacks and

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,570
eventually to mitigate the effects of

40
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,149
the attacks right now we are facing how

41
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,029
this is impacting the fall or the

42
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,189
physical caliphate how what the threat

43
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,200
evolving from the groups that we have

44
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,809
before at the dispersion that we have

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,000
seen now in Iraq and Syria and girls in

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,129
the north of this countries and the

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,129
meantime how life is the beautiful

48
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,108
caliphate

49
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:16,209
because I mean the propaganda machine of

50
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:18,519
Isis also al Qaeda but specially Isis

51
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,939
was very active one of the evidence that

52
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,530
we have the still can try to regain some

53
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,858
activity and to propose an attack is

54
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:29,200
connected to the social media me

55
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:31,540
propaganda machine is why we are looking

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,339
into two different dimensions one is the

57
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,409
physical Caliphate connected to foreign

58
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,109
fighters connected to radicalization and

59
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:39,548
incitement of provoking attacked inside

60
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:42,669
European Union Territory and the

61
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:44,739
meantime how life is the bill to a

62
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,480
Caliphate in northern to mitigate also

63
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,180
the action coming from this propaganda

64
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,480
machine in order to provoke attacks in

65
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,389
the European Union soil what ask Olivier

66
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,340
question about I'm you've you've been

67
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:59,169
involved recently discussing how there's

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,629
going to be a lot of jihadis coming out

69
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:04,329
of prison in Europe what effect is that

70
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:06,040
going to have not just the foreign

71
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:07,239
fighters who are coming back but now

72
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,650
we're having this new it this is also

73
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,299
something we're seeing United States I

74
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,730
mean I think it was last week or the

75
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:15,000
week before John Walker Lindh American

76
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,009
Taliban came out of prison and this is

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,290
one early wave of jihadists but now

78
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:22,448
they're coming out how is that going to

79
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,879
affect things security services in

80
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:29,290
Europe are extremely concerned about the

81
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,328
the release in the next 18 months of 500

82
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,388
dangerous jihadis that they will have to

83
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:37,720
monitor 24/7 and remember the main issue

84
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:40,620
that security services have is problem

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,659
and lack of means for every single

86
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,909
jihadis that they have to follow 24/7

87
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:49,269
follow their social media they need 30

88
00:03:45,909 --> 00:03:51,608
officers so if you throw them another

89
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,400
500 that there are potentially deemed

90
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:56,409
dangerous they're gonna be overextended

91
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,090
and already I can assure you that

92
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,060
security services have to make choices

93
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,139
because they have to time and again pick

94
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:07,090
the person they think will most probably

95
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:09,459
carry out an attack and so they've been

96
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:14,409
extremely good I'll take on on the point

97
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:15,969
of Manuel yes in a way for us all the

98
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:18,699
threat has gone down but not for

99
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:21,880
security services we still even higher

100
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:23,590
in the number of plots foiled today that

101
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,900
we were three years ago we're talking

102
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:29,109
about at least once a month

103
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,080
in the UK close to two a month in France

104
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,660
so security services have really learned

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,159
from the experience of the attacks of

106
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:42,160
2015 to clamp down and be extremely more

107
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:45,520
effective with cooperation to the level

108
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,160
that it wasn't there so yes it's a huge

109
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,099
issue but down the road and what's been

110
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,290
since 2001 the main problem for security

111
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,479
services is the guys that they don't

112
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,870
have on the radar so the attack in lyon

113
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,810
last last week is extremely concerning

114
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,080
for them because this guy a German

115
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:08,229
student was not vicious so it was not on

116
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,060
a terror watchlist contrary to most of

117
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:12,460
the people that we've seen with with a

118
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:16,479
globe SEC study that we're on that list

119
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,638
and the guy basically wanted to carry

120
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,370
out an attack just before the European

121
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,669
election to make Malan lepen more

122
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:27,039
powerful and basically to steer a kind

123
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:28,570
of civil war and that's the thing I was

124
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,789
gonna mention was you know I know

125
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,349
Rukmini kalamaki of New York Times has

126
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,599
been really great about making this a

127
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,630
point that the number of attacks

128
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,150
attempted has not changed by Isis since

129
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,800
about 2015 the difference has been

130
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,010
security intelligence services have been

131
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:49,180
better at supporting it cats purr I want

132
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:51,039
to ask you you just Globe SEC just did a

133
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,139
great report on foreign fighters from

134
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,330
Europe and I get this question all the

135
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,310
time in terms of everyone just wants a

136
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,590
simple answer what is an Isis fighter

137
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,840
who are they and it's obviously very

138
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,099
broad and complex but that's why I'm

139
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,020
gonna throw you this question

140
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:08,020
gnostic thank you yes so if you can

141
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,400
briefly summarize tell me who are the

142
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,430
isis fighters that were there that left

143
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,080
to go fight for Isis knock hi it said no

144
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,849
it's a kind of like a question which

145
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,620
which pushes me towards a kind of like a

146
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,760
statistical mathematical answer and I

147
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,979
love you know providing such answers

148
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,450
like saying the answer is 7 and then you

149
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:25,630
know go figure what that means in this

150
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:27,280
sense it's easy to give us to give you a

151
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,860
kind of like a snapshot and but I mean

152
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,570
we have to look behind the snapshots all

153
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,330
kind of like you know into two to two

154
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,880
sections if I may first is that okay you

155
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,128
know I'm gonna give you the the I guess

156
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,349
the obvious male

157
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:44,349
late twenties early thirties so it's not

158
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:47,649
teenage rebellion eighty-seven thirteen

159
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:49,659
males versus females we're looking at

160
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,830
people who quite often an hour French

161
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,330
team who's present here in the room

162
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,248
actually was pushing this furthest this

163
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:56,019
in in in the reports that people who are

164
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:58,539
actually in between errs they're hybrids

165
00:06:56,019 --> 00:07:02,199
so in one hand they come from areas in

166
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:06,039
which people who move in packs I would

167
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:08,050
say gangs do things together stuff

168
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:11,919
together and this stuff could be

169
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,659
football could be crime could be well

170
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,349
basketball probably less likely but you

171
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,330
get my point

172
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,740
but then it could as well be me

173
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,779
terrorism so we've got you know you have

174
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,179
people who are you have a huge

175
00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:24,849
constituency of people who are not who

176
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:26,318
are not committed religiously let's put

177
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:28,389
it this way although that many of them

178
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,889
are and I don't want to discount geo

179
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,110
kappa zero kappa point about you know

180
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,729
radicalization in in in places like that

181
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,529
but you've got a huge community of

182
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:37,449
people who are also Fox that's Olivia

183
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:39,039
for you but then you have a community of

184
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:41,199
people who are in between and you know

185
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,329
we see those hybrid so I would say in in

186
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,039
a nutshell I wouldn't like to go down

187
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:49,240
the path of like this this this and that

188
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:52,659
the person is a hybrid in between things

189
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,599
moving in between communities in between

190
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:57,219
I wouldn't say jobs but actually better

191
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,719
of this and a bit of that and a better

192
00:07:57,219 --> 00:08:00,909
of this and a bit of that in our case

193
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:02,229
you know majority of the modality of our

194
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,139
project was that we're looking at the

195
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:07,119
criminal connections and yes I would

196
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,919
love to say that there is some there is

197
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,509
a crime terror Nexus yes and to some

198
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,119
extent it does exist but I would say

199
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:14,979
it's a slightly different take many of

200
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:18,039
Europe's terrorists are former criminals

201
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:20,558
but they're not necessarily use the

202
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:25,300
criminal proceeds or the criminal

203
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:26,769
know-how in their terroristic activity

204
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,050
so you know we gotta we gotta make that

205
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:30,219
clear let's let's abandon or sometimes

206
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,990
you know be bit more critical towards

207
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,149
this kind of kind of a cliche but I mean

208
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,469
in one word they're hybrids yeah I mean

209
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:38,828
if you look at someone like a Zarqawi

210
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,659
for example he was a he was a criminal

211
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:42,818
he went to jail he had tons of tattoos

212
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,160
he cut them all off himself joined an

213
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:47,589
al-qaeda and it kind of went from there

214
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,329
and the same thing goes for I know in

215
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:50,380
Canada there was some individuals I was

216
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:52,750
in touch with who were there who were

217
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,310
part of Isis there were a group of five

218
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,010
friends they all went to the same

219
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:59,050
moussala and then they all went over to

220
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,730
Iraq and Syria together so there's this

221
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,520
sort of grouping going on and and I

222
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:07,960
would add you know it is quite often

223
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,800
young men unfortunately Meredith I want

224
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,030
to ask you what about all the people

225
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,300
that are over right now

226
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,810
in Kurdish camps both men women and

227
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,120
children

228
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,010
what would humanitarian crisis is facing

229
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,690
them and are you talking about

230
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,550
foreigners or foreign fighters that have

231
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,980
been captured by the KRG

232
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,630
well first of all thank you so much to

233
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,220
globe sac for the invitation my first

234
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,530
clubs that conference I'm thrilled to be

235
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:38,350
here you know our perspective on this

236
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:40,600
organizationally is unequivocal states

237
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,500
need to repatriate their citizens they

238
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:47,050
need to take them back and they need to

239
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:50,590
arrest them and/or provide services to

240
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:52,479
them because that's their responsibility

241
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:56,200
these people are their citizens they're

242
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,630
being held in unstable prisons or camps

243
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:04,000
that are prison like we have a

244
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,450
generation of children many of whom are

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,490
haven't been to school in say five years

246
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,440
and so this is not this is a

247
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,960
humanitarian issue but it's a security

248
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,880
issue because if you leave those people

249
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:20,800
there if they're not tried in a kangaroo

250
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,689
court in Iraq that may or may not

251
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,000
actually be accurate about what they've

252
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:27,100
done and sentence them to death or to

253
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,839
something else I mean it's it's possible

254
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,270
that they're getting a fair trial there

255
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,940
it's unclear but for the ones held in

256
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,010
Syria not only are the SDF not a

257
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:39,940
government that can actually adjudicate

258
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:44,100
you know any of those claims but they

259
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:47,620
are we are reinforcing the narrative the

260
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:51,160
incredibly powerful ideology of you do

261
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,530
not belong which is you know and not to

262
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,939
put too fine of a point on what Kasper

263
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,480
said but there must be a sense of

264
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,490
belonging that was absent for that

265
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,780
pilgrimage to take place in the first

266
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,649
place so the long-term solutions are

267
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,829
complicated there are

268
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,540
are expensive they're labor-intensive

269
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:13,719
they don't fit into an election cycle

270
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,689
it's a really hard political cell to

271
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,470
take people back but it is necessary for

272
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:21,550
our security

273
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:23,559
so I'll just say quickly many of you may

274
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,290
know that Osama bin Laden's citizenship

275
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:28,689
was revoked he wasn't allowed to go back

276
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,059
to Saudi Arabia and he went to and he

277
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:34,149
formed Sudan excuse me al Qaeda in Sudan

278
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:36,279
and many of the original cadre of al

279
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:38,350
Qaeda were people whose citizenship was

280
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,790
either revoked or they knew that they

281
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,459
would face death if they went home so

282
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,009
they didn't go back and so we we see

283
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:47,529
that Lee you know creating citizens of

284
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:49,660
the Islamic state is what we're doing by

285
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:51,809
not taking our citizens back yeah I mean

286
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,819
you had that whole Egyptian contingent

287
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:56,290
is that way here II you know this was

288
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:58,839
somebody who couldn't go back to Egypt

289
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,179
they all went and made it much more

290
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,170
violent organization because of it one

291
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,339
thing I wanted to mention the audience

292
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,199
as well is you don't have to just listen

293
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,509
to me ask questions you can ask

294
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:10,359
questions on slide oh so I'll be taking

295
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:12,339
them throughout this discussion one

296
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,540
thing I wanted to open up to all of you

297
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:16,839
now that we've sort of established what

298
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:20,230
the issue is what are we supposed to do

299
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:22,629
as a society and governments with a the

300
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,749
returnees coming from Iraq and Syria and

301
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:27,879
be the wave of jihadists are coming out

302
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:31,929
of prisons across Europe and in North

303
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:34,870
America and feel free to jump in I just

304
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:37,209
wanted to take on Meredith's point on

305
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,860
what could happen if there are Patriot

306
00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:40,929
because obviously in Europe the

307
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,329
sentencing is not at the level it is in

308
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:46,410
the u.s. so if you arrest someone for

309
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:48,819
terrorism in France or the UK you can

310
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:51,160
sentence him to five year in jail within

311
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:53,139
two and a half years is out for good

312
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,709
behavior this doesn't happen in the US

313
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:59,170
so our legal system is not ready

314
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:03,279
in terms of welcoming those people and

315
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,868
sentencing them enough for our security

316
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,749
services to be able to face them because

317
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:10,779
if we were to repatriate whatever

318
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:14,410
numbers the 500 figure that I told you

319
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:17,850
would swell to 1,500 and our security

320
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:20,529
services can not have that

321
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,019
to go on your on your second point and

322
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:26,680
what I think is critical in terms of the

323
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:29,319
threat is that unfortunately it's very

324
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,540
difficult because it's a big machine for

325
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:33,849
government to move from the threat of

326
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,410
foreign fighters of returnees which

327
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:39,819
security for services focus so much and

328
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,040
didn't really happen the way they

329
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:45,689
expected it to happen and the problem

330
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:51,009
that we have in the larger society of

331
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:53,429
potentially people just alienated in our

332
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:55,360
society and going and saying look I

333
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,920
pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr

334
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,459
al-baghdadi and I'm gonna go into a

335
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,139
cinema in Paris and kill 15 people

336
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:05,018
that's the kind of thing that we're

337
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:07,240
seeing and that security services have

338
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:09,910
switched from the foreign fighters each

339
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:14,050
true to people like this where they have

340
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:17,610
a difficult handle last point that I

341
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,589
want to put to you is that in our

342
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,499
misfortune we've been extremely lucky

343
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:26,069
that the wave of jihadist attacks that

344
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:29,319
we had in Europe were done by amateurs

345
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:31,179
because whether you think that they were

346
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:33,248
extremely well-trained in Syria and Iraq

347
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:35,889
and it was the cream of the crop you

348
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:39,370
look at all the major plots that were

349
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:43,389
successful from Charlie Hebdo to the

350
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:47,370
November 2015 attack to Brussels to even

351
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:50,230
Barcelona they basically screwed up

352
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,629
their their plan I mean you look at

353
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,100
charlie they didn't go to the right

354
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:57,850
building at first they didn't even know

355
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:00,399
what we're shall he was you look at the

356
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,160
attack in November 2015 in Paris they

357
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,929
wanted to blow up in the stat de France

358
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,959
in the football stadium they didn't buy

359
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:10,230
a ticket to get in and then they blow

360
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,729
the the suicide bomber blows himself

361
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:16,660
right outside doesn't wait for all the

362
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:21,369
people to come in to Tokyo to kill more

363
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:23,949
fatalities so I think that the next step

364
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:27,790
is as we will discuss the nexus between

365
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:30,670
Islamic state and aq al-qaeda the main

366
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:34,089
thing has to do with something extreme

367
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:37,020
Emily powerful in terms of what could

368
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:40,330
happen and you know for the first time

369
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,579
mi5 have said that there's a five

370
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,250
percent probability that we will get a

371
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:48,850
chemical attack in London for them to

372
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:52,840
say that is a huge hurdle and I think

373
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,130
that we have to be thinking about what

374
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,440
the next step will be

375
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,320
but I guess one question I have is is

376
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,390
increased sentencing really going to

377
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,980
help when we know that a lot of

378
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,540
radicalization and a lot of you know

379
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,480
creating these stronger ties between

380
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,400
jihadists happens in prison right so

381
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,800
that that's the second conundrum they're

382
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,010
looking at so there were experiences in

383
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,719
the UK and France of segregating the

384
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,140
people that were sentenced for terrorism

385
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,120
so that they don't radicalize others

386
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:25,569
it's a mixed bag in terms of what

387
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:28,030
happened because what we had in the past

388
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:31,750
twelve months if we had in France a lot

389
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:35,160
of radicals attacking their their guard

390
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:37,660
and you had that kind of issue that that

391
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,480
basically just fostered this kind of

392
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,390
violence and at the same time the

393
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,540
prisons are full it's very expensive so

394
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:48,819
there needs to be a way to tackle this

395
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,640
issue but you cannot let those people

396
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,430
roam free Meredith I can tell you want

397
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,800
to jump in yeah I would just not

398
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,239
disagree with anything Olivier said a

399
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,060
because I think that's just a good

400
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,430
policy in general but because I think

401
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,970
that that that's all right I do think

402
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:10,000
that also so and if you're looking to

403
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:13,079
interrupt the cycle of violence you do

404
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,490
have to do something that seems

405
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:18,310
difficult and it's certainly not

406
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,589
politically expedient it's it's just

407
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:23,139
that the idea that they will either stay

408
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,439
in prisons they're they you know will

409
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,970
somehow the Iraqis and the Syrians will

410
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,530
figure this out there they've been

411
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,930
asking me you know the figures that the

412
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:34,090
Iraqis have asked for to keep foreigners

413
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,830
in prison it's two billion dollars or

414
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,419
something like that that no one is

415
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,189
willing to pay for interested in paying

416
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,900
for are they going to keep them there

417
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,850
indefinitely they'll get out of prison

418
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,240
someday and then what so do we think

419
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,699
they're going to be for

420
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,679
d radicalized in those prisons and when

421
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,330
they get out why wouldn't they want to

422
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,399
commit attacks against the countries

423
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,590
that didn't take them back further if

424
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:57,199
they're not kept in a secure prison and

425
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,510
they exit to another country they could

426
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,039
pick up the phone and easily connect

427
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,890
with a cell that's back in their home

428
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,250
country and facilitate an attack that

429
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,320
way they don't need to be physically in

430
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,510
the country to facilitate that so

431
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,580
there's there's that but largely and

432
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,649
this this could be an entire hour in and

433
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:19,580
of itself but disrupting the cycle of

434
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:21,500
violence keeping prisoners they're

435
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,418
keeping foreigners they're keeping

436
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,520
children without services without

437
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:27,799
vaccines without enough food without

438
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,179
education all we are doing is creating

439
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:32,750
the next generation of the Caliphate

440
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:35,029
Cass bracket

441
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,710
yeah quickly I jump in on this point cuz

442
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,880
I'm glad that mr. Navarette will speak

443
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,669
last on this because we're you know

444
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,559
we're not answering to any bureaucracy

445
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:44,270
or organization and we're giving advice

446
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,399
and then you have to deal with the

447
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,139
reality so we can kind of freely express

448
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,510
opinions on that and I'm happy I can do

449
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,490
that so I'll say this I mean I always

450
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:55,490
got the impression that counterterrorism

451
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:56,539
we cannot talk about this or that that

452
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,980
this is this is what we're gonna be

453
00:18:56,539 --> 00:19:00,140
doing this year and we're gonna move on

454
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:02,630
to something else next year that was one

455
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,039
of the secretaries in or you know the

456
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,179
Northern Irish circuit is who who was

457
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,529
saying okay now we're gonna start

458
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:07,490
shooting I write people and we're gonna

459
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:10,010
be shooting more than the previous

460
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,690
government look where it led so I mean

461
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,309
you have to have a full range of options

462
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,289
and I think in this case ban when you're

463
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:17,418
asking what do we do if the returnees

464
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:19,370
people going out of jail I think the bad

465
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:21,110
news is and this is what Oliver talked

466
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,699
about and both and also humor if that

467
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:28,070
you need as resources to assess them

468
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:28,850
individually and when I say full range

469
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,460
of options

470
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,260
it starts probably and/or it started

471
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,080
with kinetic options in the Middle East

472
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,990
a couple of years back going back to the

473
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,449
softest of options back here back here

474
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,279
in Europe and it's a question of you

475
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,659
know who's who and where but you know

476
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,429
who makes the call how do you establish

477
00:19:44,659 --> 00:19:47,809
that kind of you know infrastructure

478
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,000
that makes this decision and it's not

479
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:52,190
just a security infrastructure just to

480
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,990
complicate matters it must be all the

481
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,940
other elements and I mean as we

482
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,940
implement our projects and we go around

483
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,769
Europe

484
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,330
they're still because of the there's

485
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:02,090
lots of resistance in different

486
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:05,460
countries of you know non-security

487
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:06,658
actors to be involved in this in this in

488
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,179
this process angle it's not us it's

489
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:11,549
Ministry of Interior it's not us it's

490
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,769
the security services the police well

491
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:15,210
not really I mean we're talking a murder

492
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:18,299
if you were talking about vaccines you

493
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,529
know education we're talking prisons you

494
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:21,119
know there could be so many other

495
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:23,580
sectors of society and actually

496
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,559
government that we need to bring

497
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,418
together in a sense to make a call about

498
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,960
that person or the other person and if

499
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:32,639
you throw into that kids well that again

500
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,859
complicates matters even further

501
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:37,379
and a lot of this is sort of shrouded in

502
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,129
top secrecy in some ways and I mean

503
00:20:37,379 --> 00:20:39,599
that's sort of the heart of this

504
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:42,899
conversation I think we have to bear in

505
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,789
mind is that you know returning jihadist

506
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:46,258
fighters this is actually not a new

507
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:48,809
phenomenon we've been dealing with this

508
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,340
since you know time immemorial and also

509
00:20:48,809 --> 00:20:52,080
there was a high-profile event of it in

510
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,999
the 80s with the Mujahideen in in

511
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,158
Afghanistan so this is something I think

512
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:59,309
it's much more nuanced than just to

513
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,440
throw one solution at but one question I

514
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:03,479
wanted to ask you many well was you know

515
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,220
for law enforcement I know in Canada and

516
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:07,700
in the u.s. although the u.s. is

517
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,779
probably the most robust policing of

518
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,820
terrorists and bringing them back to you

519
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:16,049
know the Southern District New York to

520
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,918
face charges how hard is it to catch a

521
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:20,849
terrorist and also charged with a crime

522
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,799
well I think coming back to the

523
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:24,960
discussion that we have I think there is

524
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,869
no simple solution because it's a very

525
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,580
complex problem so sometimes we try to

526
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:32,609
simplify the things in order to give

527
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,039
clarity and solution we don't have a

528
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:37,379
simple solution for that and you can

529
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,769
believe in global justice but then you

530
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:43,080
had to apply individual treatment every

531
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:45,960
single country in the European Union

532
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,668
also the US or Australia Canada they

533
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,059
hold their own national regulation to be

534
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:52,979
apply to the individual they are

535
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:55,889
suspected to commit a crime then you had

536
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:57,119
to individualize the treatment as biggie

537
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:59,969
for the law enforcement point of view

538
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,580
what kind of crime he or she committed

539
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,259
okay no evidence you can gather what is

540
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,269
the cooperation that you have with the

541
00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:10,470
countries that were this crime were

542
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:12,870
perpetrated Iraq Syria Turkey No

543
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,539
see this time and then you had to try to

544
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,850
obtain this everything and to be proven

545
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:20,100
that could be used in due time in court

546
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:21,809
is talking about the criminal let's say

547
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,820
lying off action which is not easy

548
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,168
because we are talking about difficult

549
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,629
territory we're talking of all lack

550
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:29,010
evidence how you respect the chalmers

551
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,710
custody of the evidence so it's not

552
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:35,309
really a single solution for that so the

553
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:37,860
national legislation had to be respected

554
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:39,480
and apply for every single case at the

555
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,418
meantime I fully agree what you said is

556
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,360
no only alone formal solution we are

557
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:47,730
charged to deal with the violence let's

558
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,350
say aria of these people because they

559
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:52,320
pose a risk to the European Union or

560
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:53,879
anyone else so we try to assess what

561
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,428
kind of indication do we have in

562
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,440
northern to anticipate the action to

563
00:22:56,429 --> 00:23:00,690
happen in northern to prevent this

564
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,549
attack dropping I was mentioned behold

565
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:04,530
we have steel attacks in European Union

566
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:07,289
soil and speaking about European Union

567
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:10,379
mostly but this year in 2018 we have

568
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:12,539
more foil attacks why because we share

569
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,419
more information we analyze better the

570
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:17,220
information we connect the dots fastly

571
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,250
emerge in a very accurate way and then

572
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,110
we try to prevent this to happen but

573
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,390
every single case you have to be

574
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,100
analyzed by the intelligence and the law

575
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,080
enforcement so there is no single

576
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,260
solution but many alternatives and a lot

577
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,330
of work and commitment from the security

578
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,520
for many areas to prevent this to happen

579
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,750
because that's sort of the problem is

580
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,668
sometimes I mean I've heard this from

581
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,650
lawyers as well that you know when a

582
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,510
foreign fighter went to Iraq or Syria

583
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,460
they could be there for three years

584
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,440
that's a complete blackout on what the

585
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,789
person actually did or you know of

586
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,370
course they probably were a part of a

587
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:52,110
group how do you convict them on a crime

588
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,030
if they come back and they're tried a

589
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:55,620
lawyer will say well you have no

590
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,200
evidence of these crimes this was

591
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:00,209
completely unknown so I guess that leads

592
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,820
me to another question is you know how

593
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:04,440
my dear addict ization programs have

594
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:08,360
been done I know in Belgium and

595
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,890
Netherlands I believe how how will those

596
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,250
what part did they play in this whole

597
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:16,890
debate yes a short remark one of the

598
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:18,870
main so everything is social media

599
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,700
monitoring especially because the

600
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,158
chatter is the foreign fighters in Iraq

601
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,269
they like to do surface they like to

602
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,369
show that they are key

603
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:29,029
people innocent people also there this

604
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:31,529
is why so important that we have strick

605
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:33,269
cooperation on social media monitoring

606
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:35,639
between the Member States intelligence

607
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:37,320
about the provider I have important very

608
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:40,258
very effective when we are able to

609
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,839
identify terrorists before they able to

610
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:44,909
come to any other country outside a

611
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:46,080
Syria on Iraq so it's quite reinforce

612
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:49,320
the cooperation that we have in this

613
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,999
case is quite relevant just the digital

614
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,830
footprint is one of the element that we

615
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:55,129
are focusing now do you law enforcement

616
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,418
look at it closely enough do you think I

617
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:59,458
think we are in cooperation with the

618
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,139
intelligence service we are improved the

619
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:04,349
cooperation that we have on these

620
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:05,758
specific profiles and especially the

621
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:07,589
cooperation with the industry we have

622
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,209
cooperation through the European Union

623
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:12,269
internal forum with Google Twitter

624
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:14,309
Facebook telegram also try to help us to

625
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:16,259
identify this contest to remove it by

626
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:18,869
the mean time the person who was behind

627
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:21,629
the contact and also to focus on the

628
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:23,249
propaganda machine we in cooperation

629
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:26,309
with the Member State Europe all support

630
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:29,669
the takedown of a Mac the main app for

631
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:31,709
propaganda machine off of Isis so this

632
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:33,479
is one of the measures that we say but

633
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:37,619
fighting the propaganda machine we can

634
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:39,059
fight radicalization more broadly how

635
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:42,329
does the rest of the panel feel about

636
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:45,570
the radicalization programs a huge

637
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:47,729
failure we've seen it time and again I

638
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:51,418
mean you look at what happened in

639
00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:53,519
Denmark in France in Belgium in

640
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:55,709
Netherlands I mean I've been dealing

641
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,950
with Jerry's for the past 25 years I

642
00:25:55,709 --> 00:26:01,769
have maybe four cases of people that I

643
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:05,669
know personally that had a change of

644
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:08,549
heart it's extremely difficult when

645
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:12,929
you're in your late 20s to have somebody

646
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:16,139
deep brainstorm you if it's done at you

647
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:18,839
know 10 12 years old yeah it's fine but

648
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:21,599
it has been the main problem and you see

649
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,599
that security services and governments

650
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:27,178
have to deal with the growing number of

651
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,789
radicalized individuals we talk about

652
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:32,519
30,000 people not only in France but in

653
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:33,179
the UK and Germany that are potential

654
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,690
jihadist

655
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:38,520
on at our watch list and 3,000 our deem

656
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,810
extremely dangerous

657
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:47,820
and as I said at any given time the UK

658
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:51,450
services can follow 50 guys so we have a

659
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:55,770
huge problem when it comes into getting

660
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,510
budget to also education social but also

661
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,670
to security because you see when there's

662
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:02,250
an attack politicians would blame the

663
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,500
security services the police but they're

664
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:09,210
not giving them any means that they

665
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:14,120
would need in order to fight off so time

666
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:18,030
and again we have to see how much of

667
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,610
radicalization happens but also what's

668
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:23,760
happening within the communities in

669
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:25,919
terms of conspiracy theories for

670
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,230
instance I mean you go around in some

671
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,380
places in France of Belgium people will

672
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,000
tell you that September 11 is not was

673
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,560
not done by Muslim was not done by

674
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,880
al-qaeda but by the Mossad in the US

675
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,190
still going on

676
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,650
same with Charlie Hebdo they said look

677
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,360
of course it's the government how could

678
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:44,460
they the cauchy brothers could have been

679
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,469
so stupid to leave their ID papers in

680
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,740
the car it proves that it's the

681
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:52,440
government and so this part of the

682
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:56,220
radicalization process is what worries

683
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,500
me and it's what's building the idea of

684
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,820
the far-right coming in in the picture

685
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,950
and building over that and the potential

686
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:12,300
of putting communities one against the

687
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:15,810
other I actually had a former al Qaeda

688
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:18,389
fighter from the US who fought in

689
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:22,409
northern Pakistan on the border of

690
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:26,520
Afghanistan and he was a 9/11 truther or

691
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:29,010
is a 9/11 truther and I was like of all

692
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,230
people how do you think that you know

693
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,430
how do you think that way but I think

694
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,400
you're right there's there's a lot to do

695
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:39,060
with disinformation that is important in

696
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:41,010
the radicalization process um well I

697
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:45,659
think Olivier brought up a lot of really

698
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:47,280
important points I would say that rather

699
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,930
than talk strictly about

700
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,660
de-radicalization I want to bring it

701
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:53,700
back again to this idea of prevention

702
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,500
I don't know what everyone expected you

703
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,700
know we have such a great full room and

704
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,400
that's wonderful it says there's a lot

705
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,620
of interest in this topic but I think if

706
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,330
there was an an idea that there would be

707
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,800
a silver bullet that we'd be able to say

708
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:07,409
what to do or how to do it and that

709
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,919
would be simple or it's impossible there

710
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:14,130
is no panacea I my organization is

711
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,960
founded by a former FBI Special Agents

712
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,820
so we know law enforcement is something

713
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,740
we talk about and think about all of the

714
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,929
time that doesn't mean we don't think

715
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,240
about and talk about prevention and so

716
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:27,000
if we don't want to play whack-a-mole

717
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,130
with all of the radicalized individuals

718
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,990
that Olivia is talking about and that

719
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:35,220
men well is talking about the only

720
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:37,320
selective is to be talking

721
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,660
simultaneously in these conversations

722
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,379
about prevention and that is a whole of

723
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:45,450
society approach that's about inclusion

724
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,740
that's about countering the ideology

725
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:52,410
it's it's a really important nuanced

726
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,600
complicated conversation but certainly

727
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,790
there are some areas where we could

728
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,949
start to have agreement like children

729
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:02,159
even if you can't agree on that we'd

730
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:04,390
ever D radicalize any adult male you

731
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,170
know the fact that children are

732
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,780
[Music]

733
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:12,630
wallowing in those camps I mean it's it

734
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:14,129
is creating the exact problem we claim

735
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,110
we're trying to solve by having them

736
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,700
there in the first place so I think as

737
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,040
an international community and I know

738
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:21,470
there's a lot of talk about tribunals

739
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,460
and whether or not there could be

740
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,890
personally I don't think that would work

741
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,780
you know the United States getting on

742
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,030
board with ideas around capital

743
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,980
punishment with some of the European

744
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,780
states we execute minors in the US I

745
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,390
mean there's no way we're gonna have I'm

746
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,610
not advocating for that but there's

747
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:40,890
simply no way we'd have like a universal

748
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,139
idea about how to try and punish people

749
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,170
so I think that that's dead in the water

750
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:49,140
I think it's a silly idea but I

751
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:51,780
understand the intention behind it but

752
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,270
there there have to be some some places

753
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,680
we can we can agree as an international

754
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,690
community I would like to think children

755
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,250
is one of them and I'll come back to

756
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:01,230
Olivia's points if I may

757
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,240
Olivia doesn't like the radicalization I

758
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,320
have problems with some people who write

759
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,940
about the radicalized

760
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,000
because I'm old enough to remember when

761
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:11,970
the business started you know it's 15

762
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,190
years ago when Horgan and bjorgo publish

763
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,380
their books walking away from terrorism

764
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,690
you know disengagement I preferred this

765
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:21,120
engagement because it's kind of easier

766
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,769
let's say to achieve accomplish to say

767
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,120
that I'm no longer gonna fight I can

768
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:26,490
still be the radical that Oliver

769
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,989
mentioned and I remember this this

770
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,179
started 15 years ago and his whole

771
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,309
cycles of expertise academia on

772
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,590
terrorism studies goes and took this

773
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:36,870
kind of fashion foreign fighters is the

774
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,639
one that is still there and I'm I'm to

775
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:41,309
blame for that by the way cuz I I mean I

776
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:43,080
I we serve these these waves but the

777
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:44,879
wave of the radicalization which is you

778
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,220
know pretty old like 15 years or more

779
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:49,080
it's still holding and we still as

780
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,610
married if said we cannot figure out the

781
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,399
kind of the lowest kind of the

782
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:56,610
low-hanging fruit and we can what works

783
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:58,620
what's you know what's applicable what

784
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,719
can we all agree on and you know don't

785
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,668
just argue about definitions and then

786
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,679
things like that but this business is

787
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:06,059
still is still out there I think John

788
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:07,679
and Tory I kind of like moved on

789
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:10,139
probably after those 15 years and they

790
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,000
look at this multitude of people still

791
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:14,850
fighting over us as if in a medieval

792
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,379
battle over over over this terminology

793
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,969
so I mean I find that curious and

794
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:21,029
there's some quite good minds in the

795
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,889
business yet we still you know fight

796
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:26,250
over the same battles again and again I

797
00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:27,779
think prevention it seems to be the name

798
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,570
of the game and one thing I think a lot

799
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,529
of people can agree on is that

800
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,299
individuals who were part of these

801
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:35,850
groups who do come to the other side

802
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:39,570
they tend to be very powerful voices in

803
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:41,219
the in the radical societies where some

804
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,480
of these fighters have come from so

805
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:48,019
that's one thing to think of but go

806
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:52,710
ahead to look at is the issue of

807
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:54,269
preventing through a means of radical

808
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:59,039
figures because you look at a country

809
00:32:54,269 --> 00:33:00,840
like the UK undream should re who's been

810
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,779
jailed for five years and came out after

811
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,519
two and a half years is one of the

812
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:08,399
leading figures of the jihadist scene

813
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,159
that has been able to basically recruits

814
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,399
hundreds of people so what I've always

815
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,919
tried to tell you know people within the

816
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,010
the home office in terms of what we

817
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,790
should be looking at

818
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:24,220
we are tackling terrorism like the u.s.

819
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:27,190
tackled the war on drugs in the 80s

820
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,500
basically we've decided that instead of

821
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:33,160
going after the drug dealer we're going

822
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:35,530
after the drug user and the main problem

823
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:38,650
with terrorism is the guy that is

824
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:41,020
basically brainwashing in his mosque 200

825
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,570
people that are gonna end up in Syria

826
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:45,730
and that guy never goes there never dies

827
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:48,070
there it just pushes people to blow

828
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:51,370
themselves up and he leaves freely in

829
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,590
our countries so that is one of the

830
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:57,100
aspect that we should be looking at in

831
00:33:53,590 --> 00:34:01,928
terms of counterterrorism is to go after

832
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:04,500
the preachers of hate I'm gonna turn to

833
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:04,500
some audience questions

834
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:16,750
here's one from Alexandra sending people

835
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:19,570
sending people to the camps back should

836
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:20,859
we do this research by globe sex shows

837
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:22,290
that it is the second generation of

838
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:26,290
immigrants were prone to radicalization

839
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:27,489
is that I mean do we allow them to come

840
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:33,600
back even though that that's a

841
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:37,178
possibility I mean I I think the the

842
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:40,179
larger point is we're not keeping

843
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:42,820
ourselves safe by keeping them there I

844
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:45,250
mean it's it's a naive proposition to

845
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:50,470
think that if you keep foreigners right

846
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:53,560
now in sort of jails in Syria and camps

847
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:55,750
in Syria and you know jails in Iraq many

848
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:59,230
of which are secret that that's gonna

849
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:01,210
somehow actually keep us safer the way

850
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,480
ideology works is you can't possibly

851
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:07,869
arrest all the people who support the

852
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,790
ideology so as to first or second

853
00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:12,430
generation or who they are I think the

854
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,960
main and and if this is your study you

855
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,450
can talk more specifically about it but

856
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,020
I think the main point is what's gonna

857
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:23,980
work broadly across the board like

858
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:26,259
somatically and is there any reason to

859
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,480
think that you're not creating more

860
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:31,260
supporters of the Islamic state by the

861
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,600
policies in the home countries by the

862
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,450
Elsie's that you're following right now

863
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,830
or lack of policy in Iraq and Syria so

864
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:39,240
it's about thinking about the big

865
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,670
picture it's thinking about the long

866
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,729
term where we think this is it's a short

867
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:47,150
term security gain at best it is not a

868
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:50,220
long term solution to keep them there

869
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,830
probably in terms of do we bring in some

870
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,029
of them I mean do we bring them back

871
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:57,930
like I said before some of them probably

872
00:35:54,030 --> 00:36:00,030
yes and I mean especially kids I mean

873
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,129
they're not fighters I mean that's some

874
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,010
some actually were so that complicates

875
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,600
this further but it it is to be decided

876
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,190
I think on an individual basis let's not

877
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,600
have this you know we have to also

878
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:12,360
understand the implications that you

879
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,299
know if Iraq for example sentences and

880
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:18,180
it did already these individuals to

881
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,100
death and there's already a human rights

882
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,830
pushback which I treat with a bit of

883
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:25,049
irony in you know in this situation that

884
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:28,259
okay but these are you know citizens of

885
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:31,110
our of our of our states we should have

886
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,960
the capability to actually process them

887
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,880
through our you know through our system

888
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,200
some people say that you know not you

889
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,450
know that's what I'm saying let's bring

890
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,160
some back let's let's not bring them on

891
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,410
mass you know I'm not I'm not speaking

892
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,420
for such a deal and in terms of in terms

893
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,890
of the generations you know yes

894
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,260
second generation but then again in

895
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:51,060
countries like Italy they're most the

896
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,190
first generation they arrived very

897
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,660
recently they're not they don't yet have

898
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,580
the roots they're that much

899
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,009
that's why Italy well defending against

900
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,110
this fred has this approach of you know

901
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,790
quick deportation why can't the Quai can

902
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:06,090
they deport them because they only have

903
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:07,740
Moroccan Tunisian Egyptian citizenship

904
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,870
they're not Italians so you know it's

905
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,609
you've got spots of first generation as

906
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:14,759
well and you've got spots offered for I

907
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:17,310
mean when we get to the sex will we drop

908
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,080
this point again I'm feeling like we're

909
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:22,230
kind of flogging maybe not a dead horse

910
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,360
but the one that's very tired and

911
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,620
there's also just been I mean to look at

912
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,030
some of the fighters who've gone over

913
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,640
from Canada just you know

914
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,260
french-canadian guys who are seventh

915
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,089
generation French Canadians so this is

916
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,440
something that I mean if there's a lot

917
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,890
of different types that that have gone

918
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,870
over to reader at that point another

919
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,000
question from Hans will we see a

920
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,589
convergence of the al Qaeda and the

921
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,539
Islamic states support networks in

922
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:46,069
Europe

923
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:51,890
there was already mutual operational

924
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:55,509
support for the attacks yes we've seen

925
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:58,249
time and again that they work together

926
00:37:55,509 --> 00:38:01,549
fine but on on the lower level rather

927
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:04,459
than then then on the strategic level I

928
00:38:01,549 --> 00:38:06,079
think that the main issue has to do with

929
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:08,058
ego I mean when you're looking at

930
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,749
terrorist groups you know I come from

931
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:14,299
the corporate world and I analyze

932
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:18,499
terrorist group as corporations because

933
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:19,069
they all have means basically to make

934
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:21,439
money

935
00:38:19,069 --> 00:38:22,849
the way they make money is by getting

936
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:25,368
the return on investment on their

937
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:28,069
attacks but also they look at mergers

938
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:30,769
and acquisitions literally and they

939
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:32,959
think that look the model of Islamic

940
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:35,538
state worked fine and if you look at it

941
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:37,899
you have a DES cut to me between the

942
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:40,459
al-qaeda model and Islamic state I

943
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,979
always called the Islamic state the

944
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:45,499
McDonnells of terrorism basically you

945
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:47,419
just come in you order what you want you

946
00:38:45,499 --> 00:38:50,029
join nobody asked you anything you pay

947
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:53,689
and you leave al-qaeda is a very elitist

948
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:56,419
organization it's a top-down you have to

949
00:38:53,689 --> 00:38:59,149
be varied and that's where they made the

950
00:38:56,419 --> 00:39:01,729
mistake and when people say look the

951
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,969
Islamic state is dead yes but the genius

952
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:07,038
of Baghdadi was to announce the

953
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:09,709
caliphate because even if the physical

954
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:12,109
Caliphate has been removed in the minds

955
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:15,249
of a lot of people the Caliphate was

956
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:18,019
there and al-qaeda was never ever

957
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:19,939
thinking about getting and announcing

958
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:23,419
the Caliphate until they would rule all

959
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:25,819
over so yes we've already seen that you

960
00:39:23,419 --> 00:39:28,009
know some of al-qaeda members have moved

961
00:39:25,819 --> 00:39:32,150
to Islamic state but on the lower level

962
00:39:28,009 --> 00:39:35,029
in terms of the ego of the leaders this

963
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,909
will never happen the kind of of merger

964
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:39,229
that we can see in the corporate world

965
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:42,079
yeah very briefly to complement what you

966
00:39:39,229 --> 00:39:44,328
said I mean we cannot assess that this

967
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,439
group they are like an army this okay

968
00:39:44,329 --> 00:39:47,569
people from her querida

969
00:39:45,439 --> 00:39:49,729
on the left people for the stomach side

970
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:51,288
on the right there's no work like that I

971
00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:53,808
mean at the end there are different

972
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:56,479
models of terrorism they are different

973
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:58,400
motive they are aiming somehow different

974
00:39:56,479 --> 00:40:01,279
target but the meantime they are

975
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,319
sharings and our common points when we

976
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:07,789
speak about terrorist kosis and

977
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:09,410
terrorist activity some of the groups

978
00:40:07,789 --> 00:40:11,960
that they were initially label as

979
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,879
Islamic state now they became affiliated

980
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,980
to al-qaeda and all the way around so

981
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,880
the decent communication because at the

982
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:22,670
end the local adaptability and now you

983
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,920
say now we see especially there is a

984
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,680
controversial on social media that

985
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,289
Islamic state caliphate brittle Khalifa

986
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,660
is going down they had no the capability

987
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:35,900
to export no propaganda they had no

988
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:38,569
really able to explore this wonderful

989
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,309
image that we have killing people so

990
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,890
they're going down and al-qaeda still

991
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:44,299
remain so now al-qaeda leaders say so

992
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,368
who was wiser

993
00:40:44,299 --> 00:40:48,740
it was jus that you was selling

994
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:51,529
McDonald's or the one I was selling

995
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:54,259
cherries of quality who is now still

996
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:56,059
standing up so but this is not helping

997
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,589
the security so because we have a

998
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:59,869
competition with the cherries was never

999
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:04,308
good for the security his competition

1000
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:06,079
breeds stronger outcome well I mean also

1001
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:08,410
that's I think to die don't think it's

1002
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,329
Isis not gone I mean they're in Congo

1003
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:14,270
new place that they've recently done

1004
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:16,819
some attacks and it was interesting for

1005
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:20,109
the people who watch who are you know

1006
00:41:16,819 --> 00:41:23,509
like us watch terrorist things closely

1007
00:41:20,109 --> 00:41:24,950
when you had the image of Zawahiri

1008
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:27,619
whenever he crawled out of wherever he

1009
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:30,288
is and would say something to a camera

1010
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:32,960
he just looked so boring and just so

1011
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:35,779
just not very flashy and then all of a

1012
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,640
sudden you see a Isis video and it was

1013
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:40,640
like a first-person shooter video game

1014
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,240
and just sort of completely shows the

1015
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,770
two differences and the approach of the

1016
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,720
groups albeit they are very similar

1017
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:52,190
he's Isis rethinking its strategy in

1018
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,109
Europe now that it's fighters are

1019
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:59,329
captives in Iraq if I may been maybe

1020
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:01,308
just on the previous points as well I

1021
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:03,230
mean it's a controversial thing to say

1022
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:05,000
onstage at the globe site but let's give

1023
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,380
more credit to mr. Sawa here because

1024
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,170
he's been in the business for 50 years

1025
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:13,119
and you know it's kind of I know

1026
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:15,190
surpass a and you know glasses surpass

1027
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:17,410
and you know what kind of like he's been

1028
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:19,809
around for 50 years he's been you know

1029
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:21,640
he's the one shouting from the cage in

1030
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:22,809
early eighties in the industrial and

1031
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,970
he's still there I don't know if he

1032
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:27,819
commands five people or 500 people but

1033
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:29,890
you know is there in terms of maybe just

1034
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:31,119
coming back to its these questions are

1035
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:34,270
interconnected innocence you know the

1036
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,130
strategies and Al Qaeda Isis you know I

1037
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,349
think I get a sense that I'm probably

1038
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:39,750
too old to study this cuz for young

1039
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:41,650
people it's easy to kind of shift

1040
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,660
Alliance is the kind of like you know in

1041
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:45,640
a postmodern world and I can't you know

1042
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,788
if your left and you cannot be right and

1043
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,520
when a question is okay the ISIS as we

1044
00:42:48,789 --> 00:42:53,319
heard it's really a flow I mean when I

1045
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,869
spoke to a guy far-left who fought

1046
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:58,569
fought in Ukraine on the pro-russian Pro

1047
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:00,280
let's say separatist side and I spoke to

1048
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:01,869
him said hey there were French neo-nazis

1049
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,280
next to you in the trench did you have a

1050
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:05,410
problem this is no no I mean absolutely

1051
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,930
okay far left far right we're together

1052
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,190
and we're gonna shoot at the real enemy

1053
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,348
I mean we can discuss what the real

1054
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,599
enemy was and I think it applies to

1055
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:15,579
other ideologies in this sense and

1056
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,260
whether you know the question the Iraqi

1057
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:18,910
the Iraqi segments are they are they

1058
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:21,760
changing of course because I think man

1059
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,720
it's it's a it's a fantastic it's a

1060
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,779
recruit you know it's a recruiting

1061
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,480
Sergent in a way that you've got stories

1062
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:32,260
of people who are now in these camps who

1063
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,990
are mistreated by justice in Iraq and

1064
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,420
Syria the Europeans and I would love to

1065
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:40,750
see a study on how that plays in the

1066
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:43,930
european fan fanboy so to speak networks

1067
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,819
of Isis is this resonating you know so

1068
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:49,089
it's no longer a glorious story I went I

1069
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:50,920
thought you know and you know I won it's

1070
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:53,288
a story of failure it's a story of

1071
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,420
oppression it's a story of off of like

1072
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:57,520
you know mistreatment I'd love to see a

1073
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:00,520
study a study on that yeah I mean

1074
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:04,059
there's a there's a guy from Canada who

1075
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:07,240
I remember I was texting with him when

1076
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:08,890
he was fighting for Isis and he was

1077
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,799
always out of all the people I spoke to

1078
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:13,118
he was like the person who scared me the

1079
00:44:11,799 --> 00:44:15,190
most in terms of I knew he was involved

1080
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,859
with some really serious people who were

1081
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:20,440
fighting there anyways then you know

1082
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:22,270
fast forward four years and he's begging

1083
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,440
to come back and he's renouncing the

1084
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:26,050
whole thing he said I was missing

1085
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,910
I was misled but that I mean if I'm

1086
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:29,680
security services I would what I mean is

1087
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,210
he telling the truth is it is it right

1088
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,190
but he switched his allegiances just

1089
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:35,859
like that it was always the person I

1090
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:38,109
thought who is the most hardcore so I

1091
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:40,270
mean I agree with you one question that

1092
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:42,549
it on the extreme right wing in Europe

1093
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:43,900
and I want to modify exciting it's a

1094
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,849
it's an important question I think we

1095
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,280
need to address here as we're talking

1096
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,950
about the threat of terrorism in Europe

1097
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,440
and in North America and we like to

1098
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:56,109
focus very much so on Islamic extremism

1099
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,599
but you know through my own reporting

1100
00:44:56,109 --> 00:45:01,810
I'm seeing the way that you know these

1101
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:03,910
far-right groups are mimicking al-qaeda

1102
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:06,849
and Isis both in propaganda and in

1103
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:09,670
structure and they're now you know we

1104
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:12,700
saw a very horrific attacked by an

1105
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:14,920
amateur in Christchurch New Zealand that

1106
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:19,899
was very effective for their movement I

1107
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:23,410
mean what how do you see both the threat

1108
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:28,230
of Isis and al-qaeda and the far-right

1109
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:28,230
in Europe do you see them as similar

1110
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:34,029
well I think that you know Casper's been

1111
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,368
studying this a lot longer than I have

1112
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:40,359
but but no it is certainly something

1113
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:43,780
that we are looking at the ways in which

1114
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:46,630
the networking is is quite similar I

1115
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,369
would just say you know to sort of tie

1116
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:51,490
something I wanted to say before to this

1117
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:53,319
for people on the ground for people who

1118
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:55,439
are joining up with these different

1119
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,300
groups sometimes it's a matter of

1120
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,560
expediency especially in a place like

1121
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:04,869
Yemen or in the Sahel where depending on

1122
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,810
which which group you know gives

1123
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:10,300
credibility to your struggle you sign on

1124
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:12,160
with with their ideology I don't know

1125
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,920
that it's vastly different than what's

1126
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,980
happening in the white nationalism

1127
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:20,710
neo-nazi white supremacist space I think

1128
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:23,230
you know that we are certainly seeing

1129
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:25,720
the ways in which ideology first and

1130
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:27,609
foremost regardless of which ideology

1131
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,339
you subscribe to if it's an extremist

1132
00:46:27,609 --> 00:46:34,540
ideology it's it's attracting the same

1133
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:36,400
kind of person and so I think that that

1134
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,210
in terms of in something that my Center

1135
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,770
is working on

1136
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:41,050
is a mapping of the ways in which the

1137
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:42,400
networks between the global jihadi

1138
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:45,190
movement and the and the white

1139
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,810
nationalist movement are similar but I

1140
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:51,550
think that we can also say that that

1141
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,799
it's a space that in the United States

1142
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:56,050
anyway we're trying desperately to have

1143
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,720
government look more carefully at

1144
00:46:56,050 --> 00:47:00,100
because you talked to any FBI I mean

1145
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:03,069
they are out on this a hundred percent

1146
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:05,110
the threat is domestic terrorism and by

1147
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,780
that they mean white nationalists and

1148
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:10,120
white supremacists

1149
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,950
overwhelmingly by the numbers so and

1150
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,319
they testify in Congress to this effect

1151
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:17,710
there was recently in the House Foreign

1152
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:19,300
Affairs Committee there was a hearing on

1153
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:22,480
international terrorism where for the

1154
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:25,660
first time they wanted to elevate the

1155
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,410
threat of white nationalism along with

1156
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:31,060
Salafi Jihad ISM and Shia terrorism to

1157
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:34,480
make sure that the US government is

1158
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:39,370
looking at them all as a serious threat

1159
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:41,710
both to United States and globally I'll

1160
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,450
just say you know in terms of I probably

1161
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:45,190
I'd love to ask money well this question

1162
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:46,509
like you know if I mean probably you

1163
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,550
know you will not put up you know

1164
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,510
percentage on this but you know you had

1165
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,400
a count you know you have the

1166
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:53,890
counterterrorism center and it's

1167
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,340
creeping up you know if you could break

1168
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:59,350
it okay so that much time is on this and

1169
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,420
that much time isn't the you know on the

1170
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,440
only on the other on the other guys

1171
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,970
whoever they are because I mean I think

1172
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,010
we sometimes damping it down when you

1173
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:09,339
say white you know far-right neo-nazi

1174
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:11,380
cuz it's such a mess it's so postmodern

1175
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,150
and you know some of them would probably

1176
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,830
offended by being called far-right

1177
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,240
far-right and the real far-right would

1178
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,009
be offended that they're called for

1179
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,629
right and you know it's really it really

1180
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:21,700
really really really goes and goes in

1181
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,950
circles but I think let's be honest the

1182
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,270
classic of the of the of the genre

1183
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:27,520
Bruce Kaufman wrote that you know

1184
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:29,440
far-right guys in terms of terrorism

1185
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,890
they were actually the ones who

1186
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,590
implemented first certain innovations we

1187
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:37,180
talked a lot about social media for Isis

1188
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,790
and the usage of you know internet and

1189
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,710
nananana well these guys were pioneering

1190
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:44,259
this when hardly anyone had a computer

1191
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:47,290
so you know what you're looking at an

1192
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:49,090
adaptable network which does not have

1193
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:50,050
those standout organizations so maybe it

1194
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:53,080
does at

1195
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,720
and division in the United States so you

1196
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,790
know it's no longer just individuals you

1197
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,819
have strong types of brotherhood amongst

1198
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:02,830
them and this kind of omertà that i'm

1199
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,420
not gonna actually denounce you to the

1200
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,810
police I might not be doing this with

1201
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,900
you

1202
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:09,160
wink wink but I can you know put you up

1203
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,530
for the night and stuff do you mean

1204
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,670
there is I mean it's it's it's a cliche

1205
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,550
to say there is a network there is a

1206
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:18,280
community of these guys and I think what

1207
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:19,750
saves us from tragedy is that sometimes

1208
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,790
I get the feeling that the community is

1209
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:23,850
pretty confused as to who the enemy is

1210
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:27,310
and how to strike against that enemy

1211
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:29,020
sometimes but I'm not sure you know I

1212
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:34,180
think we're living in a bottle time in

1213
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:36,040
this in in in in this innocence I pretty

1214
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,470
much agree what you said I mean we I

1215
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,779
think we are talking about two different

1216
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:42,430
phenomenons violent phenomenons but

1217
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:45,250
logically the intelligence service the

1218
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,720
law enforcement the judiciary therefore

1219
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:49,210
Europol is focusing in the more

1220
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,240
aggressive one and in the last five

1221
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,740
years the most attack coming the most

1222
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,750
sophisticated attack work related to

1223
00:49:53,740 --> 00:50:00,729
so-called reuse by terrorism al-qaeda

1224
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:02,830
Islamic state so therefore the security

1225
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:06,760
forces try to focus on this specific

1226
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:09,190
area without let's say only focusing on

1227
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:12,310
this specific area because we know the

1228
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:14,830
phenomena had to be monitored the

1229
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:17,650
activity connected to so-called violent

1230
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:19,690
what wing we have sir an increase in the

1231
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:21,280
last year's is no comparable what we

1232
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:22,150
have now connected to the reduce

1233
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,400
bioterrorism

1234
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:25,990
but it's true that we have more cases a

1235
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,120
more action coming from the member

1236
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:30,759
states to identify the threat and to

1237
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,940
mitigate the threat but the profile is

1238
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:36,790
different they are most isolated people

1239
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:38,980
they they can become quite sophisticated

1240
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:41,800
and the means and they are imitating a

1241
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:43,870
you very well says another dynamic that

1242
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,540
we have seen in al-qaeda Islamic state

1243
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:48,640
you see the attack in New Zealand where

1244
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,500
they were broadcasting live the attacks

1245
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,259
killing their people in the Moscow but

1246
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,850
also they prepare a manifesto as they're

1247
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,160
connected to the Templar so there is

1248
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,740
some similarities even to the case that

1249
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,259
we have a few years ago Brevik case so

1250
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:03,910
there is a mediation game on this

1251
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,339
specific phenomena because they

1252
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,960
see as a reference to committee attack

1253
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:09,549
the thing we are talking about two

1254
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,490
different phenomena but at the meantime

1255
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:14,200
they are receiving treatment from the

1256
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:16,509
law enforcement intelligence and

1257
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:19,808
judicial so it's true they are not the

1258
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:22,420
same level but they still are focus they

1259
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:24,369
are one of the area of activity of the

1260
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,619
contactors activity in European Union

1261
00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:29,020
for sure animals in the u.s. yeah it was

1262
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:31,270
yesterday I saw on a social media site

1263
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:33,490
that frequents a lot of white

1264
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:36,400
nationalist terrorists are why - there's

1265
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:40,118
groups there was an image of a guy in

1266
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,250
Norway had a knife pointing at this

1267
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,829
thing called siege by James Mason just

1268
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,200
you know something else that's they have

1269
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:48,280
Bibles - like manifesto Bibles you know

1270
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,930
this is Norway is the country you don't

1271
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,420
really think this is gonna happen in but

1272
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:55,779
it does and this is something that and

1273
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:58,059
it did and you getting back to your atom

1274
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,470
Waffen point that was a group that was

1275
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:01,750
quite successful in the way that it got

1276
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:04,058
it got attention in the United States

1277
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:07,210
but also a sense inspired several

1278
00:52:04,059 --> 00:52:12,730
different chapters within Europe both

1279
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:14,020
you know places like Germany the UK and

1280
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:15,670
also the Baltics

1281
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:17,109
so Stephanie I'm going to keep an eye on

1282
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:20,440
I think it's it's important that we kind

1283
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:23,049
of mention it I'm gonna turn back to

1284
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:25,420
another question from the audience is

1285
00:52:23,049 --> 00:52:27,520
the situation in the Western Balkan

1286
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:30,930
countries regarding Islam radicalization

1287
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,930
worse than in other parts of Europe

1288
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:37,270
that's a good question and that makes me

1289
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:40,599
think about a point that I didn't make

1290
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:42,579
and that I think is important so I'll

1291
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:44,500
answer the question who ever called the

1292
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:46,289
Cougar ask the question I'll answer the

1293
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,490
question but just one point is that

1294
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:50,289
recently when we looked at threat

1295
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,689
assessment within Europe because of what

1296
00:52:50,289 --> 00:52:54,819
we said with a manual that you know

1297
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,099
security services in the West I've been

1298
00:52:54,819 --> 00:53:00,099
extremely good at finding attacks in the

1299
00:52:57,099 --> 00:53:03,160
in the past few years for me in terms of

1300
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:06,910
what I see as the major risk would be

1301
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:08,680
for instance an attack on Prague because

1302
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:12,009
you don't think about the Czech Republic

1303
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,669
as being possibly hit by an attack but

1304
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:17,300
it has hold the the hallmarks of lazy

1305
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:19,490
jihadists that

1306
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:23,210
not want to make it difficult to try to

1307
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:26,180
attack London or Paris an attack on the

1308
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:27,830
Charles Bridge in August killing

1309
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,140
American tourists British tourists

1310
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:35,000
there's a huge Jewish presence in in

1311
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:36,140
Prague so for me looking at where the

1312
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,170
threat is gonna move

1313
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,600
I think the Central and Eastern Europe

1314
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:44,540
and the Balkans are the next threat in

1315
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,310
terms of what we we can see so to answer

1316
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,880
the question yes in terms of

1317
00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:52,370
radicalization we've seen from Kosovo

1318
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:54,770
and also in Bosnia a lot of foreign

1319
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:58,910
fighters we've seen which is interesting

1320
00:53:54,770 --> 00:54:01,400
is how much there's a fight for the

1321
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:06,170
hearts and mind of for instance Bosnian

1322
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:11,060
Muslims between Saudi and Iran and they

1323
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:13,550
keep on throwing money at radicals and

1324
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:16,700
that's one of the aspects that I've seen

1325
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:19,700
time and again at the EU some of the

1326
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,890
services including the Italians are

1327
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,040
putting the Western Balkans as the

1328
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:26,330
number one threat in terms of terrorism

1329
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,950
but if you're asking people on the

1330
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:30,680
ground in the Western Balkans they're

1331
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:32,180
worried about far-right extremists I

1332
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,160
mean they're not talking about the

1333
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,529
jihadi threat he you know there is a

1334
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,569
deep concern about this this other

1335
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:41,900
problem that we absolutely should be

1336
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:43,460
talking about in tandem with us that you

1337
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,590
know people are very clear about their

1338
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,660
concerns we've been doing a lot of work

1339
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:49,460
on the ground there and so it's

1340
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:51,470
important to remember that as well yeah

1341
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,630
and I think also I think if you look at

1342
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:55,970
some of the the political groups in

1343
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:58,430
Europe some of them are attracting these

1344
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:00,290
these individuals right and and some of

1345
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:02,240
these these opinions are getting more

1346
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:03,620
mainstream and I think especially when

1347
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,629
it comes from you know this white

1348
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,710
nationalist standpoint but you know at

1349
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:09,080
the same time that there's also a

1350
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:11,120
theater that's that's had links to

1351
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,799
al-qaeda in the past you know the other

1352
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,509
we haven't discussed is you know you

1353
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,150
also have Russia that has dealt with

1354
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:19,400
both of these issues very closely and

1355
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:21,500
you have Chechnya not very far away and

1356
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,610
Chechnya has been very some of the

1357
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,010
militants that have come out of there

1358
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,800
I've been the most active in in global

1359
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:30,590
jihadist movements here's another

1360
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:31,230
question and I like this one why do a

1361
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,730
mature

1362
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:34,830
hottests attack rather than letting

1363
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:36,930
professionals do the job what holds them

1364
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:42,630
back are they afraid of anything

1365
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:45,600
I mean yes you work with what you've got

1366
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:47,460
to some extent really and then I mean

1367
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:51,420
that's what all here who's been talking

1368
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:53,369
about that you know going maybe back to

1369
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,980
President Obama's point that you know

1370
00:55:53,369 --> 00:55:58,260
this whoever wears the Lakers shirt is

1371
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:01,260
not essentially Kobe Bryant and you know

1372
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:04,470
he meant eyes you know him and Isis but

1373
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,880
then well okay and it was okay then vice

1374
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:08,640
versa so I guess it's a similar

1375
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,380
situation in this sense that that's the

1376
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,850
very last line of defense that they are

1377
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,800
amateurs that they're gonna really

1378
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:15,480
really there's that's that it's gonna be

1379
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,030
it's gonna it's gonna be a flop but I

1380
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,080
mean I always pinch myself whenever

1381
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:23,369
there is an amateur cuz they're not all

1382
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:26,069
amateurs and some of the things they're

1383
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:28,859
able to achieve maybe not in terms of

1384
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:30,630
lethality some of the things that they

1385
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:33,420
were having organizationally in terms of

1386
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:38,880
preparation some of that actually is

1387
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:40,830
quite impressive and really I wouldn't

1388
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,000
discount at all but I mean you work with

1389
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,310
what you've got and you know if they're

1390
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,190
if the the classic jihadi that we've got

1391
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:49,350
in our sample is hardly at high school

1392
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:52,050
you know hardly finishes two three

1393
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:53,160
classes of high school well they might

1394
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,320
lack certain

1395
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,509
I wouldn't say education or like you

1396
00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:00,060
know job like qualities but I mean I

1397
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:02,100
would say that they like like certain

1398
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:03,390
certain skills that they could actually

1399
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:07,319
turn them into more successful

1400
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:10,109
successful attackers would raise one

1401
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,850
point here is looking at Sri Lanka Sri

1402
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:13,980
Lanka was from far the most

1403
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:18,000
sophisticated attack since Mumbai I mean

1404
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:20,720
and the reason why not only that they

1405
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,369
were under the radar and there was

1406
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,919
problems within the domestic government

1407
00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:28,010
but also the access to cash because

1408
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,109
compared to the profile of Europeans

1409
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:33,450
those were top notch they were from the

1410
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:37,259
wealthiest Muslim families on the island

1411
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:39,169
and a figure that struck me after the

1412
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:43,020
attack is that the Sri Lankan government

1413
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:44,560
was able to freeze forty million dollars

1414
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:47,560
from those guys that

1415
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:49,360
was deemed to help them foster attack

1416
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:52,150
when you know that 911 cost half a

1417
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:56,500
million 40 million you can do a lot so

1418
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:58,690
in this case they were not I met her and

1419
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,240
we've seen how good they were

1420
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:03,820
the last thing that I want to mention

1421
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,100
compared to the question is our matters

1422
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:09,130
can create a lot of problems for us

1423
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:11,950
imagine if within the next two weeks

1424
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:14,170
each day we get an attack in in London

1425
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:17,859
in Paris and Brussels just a guy walking

1426
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:20,950
into a bakery blowing himself up it's

1427
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:25,150
just an amateur but they know each other

1428
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:27,279
imagine the impact on the economy you

1429
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:31,410
will stop going to restaurant to cinemas

1430
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:33,610
do all that if it were just low

1431
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:37,870
sophisticated attacks and that's what

1432
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:40,750
exactly the Algerian jihad is behind the

1433
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:42,790
attack is they asked him why did you

1434
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:45,250
attack in that street in front of the

1435
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:47,529
bakery he said I wanted to attack a

1436
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:49,090
place that was extremely usual that

1437
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:52,600
people would nothing would be attacked

1438
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:54,910
and that's where the dangerous yeah I

1439
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:57,520
think that that Sri Lanka attack was

1440
00:58:54,910 --> 00:59:00,100
like a throwback al Qaeda so it was all

1441
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,290
these rich rich kids and they

1442
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:05,170
effectively - undertook it and I should

1443
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:08,020
add - in in where I'm from in Canada you

1444
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:09,340
had a completely amateur guy walk into

1445
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,730
our Parliament and shoot a gun off and

1446
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:14,890
he only killed one person but it

1447
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:17,290
completely changed the way terrorism was

1448
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:19,330
was viewed in Canada up until that point

1449
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:21,790
it'd been you know almost a decade since

1450
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:23,170
everything more than a decade since 9/11

1451
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:27,370
and that was the first time someone had

1452
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:29,020
done something so I want to do something

1453
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:32,140
about that I mean there is clear

1454
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:34,570
correlation between organizational

1455
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:36,940
issues I mean you are connected to

1456
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:40,540
organization then you have apparatus

1457
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:42,790
logistic apparatus you also can attain a

1458
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:46,660
lot of funding they ain't getting more

1459
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:48,250
time to prepare your plan then you spend

1460
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,930
something on communication you spend

1461
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,520
some time acquiring their weapons or

1462
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:55,120
displeasure and then you commit the

1463
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,830
attack so is is clearly that the more

1464
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:58,720
sophisticated you are the more lethal

1465
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:01,690
you can become this is why

1466
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,580
comparison brother the more time do you

1467
01:00:01,690 --> 01:00:05,800
have to prepare the more possibility

1468
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:07,930
that you have to acquire proper weapons

1469
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:10,359
or explosive even going beyond the

1470
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:12,669
classical one then you can cause more

1471
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:14,680
bitching so the impact is very high but

1472
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:16,660
the meantime the good news is that you

1473
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:19,118
need more time to do so you need more

1474
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,920
people to do so remote communication to

1475
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:23,859
do so so the chances for the security

1476
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,849
service to spot it to spot this and to

1477
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:29,799
deter delay even prevented their hiker

1478
01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:32,440
but we are now in this line then the

1479
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,810
consequences are very high going to the

1480
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,910
direction to these individual actors

1481
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:38,830
they are not sophisticated and they had

1482
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:41,200
to be very lucky to commit the attack at

1483
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:42,940
the mean time they can be very very also

1484
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,730
little you have to remember the nice a

1485
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:47,980
case like one guy with the truck and the

1486
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:51,609
celebration of the French day they kill

1487
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:53,560
more than 80 people they sophisticate

1488
01:00:51,609 --> 01:00:55,210
the attacks you need time you need money

1489
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:57,190
you need lot of resources you need time

1490
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:57,970
and then you became little bit

1491
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:00,580
predictable

1492
01:00:57,970 --> 01:01:03,490
being predictable to commit presentable

1493
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:04,119
you go to the long act or task you need

1494
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:06,459
less time

1495
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:08,890
Janell less means and you only want to

1496
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:11,290
select one target and go for it so they

1497
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:13,720
are more unpredictable and therefore

1498
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:15,670
therefore they are less difficult to

1499
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:19,330
prevent but this is the equation they

1500
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:20,920
are working at a security level so one

1501
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:22,990
last question and it's on something I

1502
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:25,089
think we haven't really touched on

1503
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:27,490
we often hear individuals are groomed

1504
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:30,430
into joining Isis terminology associated

1505
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:33,580
with sexual exploitation how useful are

1506
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:37,089
unhelpful is this in explaining

1507
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:38,920
engagements engagement or I think maybe

1508
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:45,549
explaining how people get attracted or

1509
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:49,780
stay Jannik lovely actually good

1510
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:53,730
question as a the academic in me and the

1511
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:58,089
research enemy says whatever new new

1512
01:01:53,730 --> 01:02:00,550
taken this could help us in actually

1513
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:03,970
understanding the organization and its

1514
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:05,770
mode of operation I wouldn't discount

1515
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,098
usage of you know something from a

1516
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:10,349
completely different discipline

1517
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:12,989
I mean I've seen it work we've all seen

1518
01:02:10,349 --> 01:02:15,920
it work or not work as well let's be

1519
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:18,690
honest but I wouldn't discount it

1520
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,279
whether actually this one I mean I'm not

1521
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:23,670
knowledgeable about this at all I mean

1522
01:02:20,279 --> 01:02:25,140
in terms of like what we see I mean I

1523
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:27,930
wouldn't say exploitation what we see in

1524
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:30,538
our our sample is really people having

1525
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:32,430
this I mean it's this might sound

1526
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:35,489
controversial but quite a lot of them

1527
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:37,198
really do have issues and problems in

1528
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:39,269
childhood during trouble during their

1529
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,699
childhoods and of course this is just

1530
01:02:39,269 --> 01:02:48,149
one variable there's so many others but

1531
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:49,559
you know broken homes dramas even you

1532
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:53,239
know kind of like some kind of traumatic

1533
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:56,430
traumatic in their mind quite often

1534
01:02:53,239 --> 01:02:58,709
situations from from from school I'm not

1535
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:00,779
saying that this should be the compass

1536
01:02:58,709 --> 01:03:02,219
for us now but when you see a lot of

1537
01:03:00,779 --> 01:03:04,469
stuff like that and there's a book on

1538
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:06,089
that coming up that basic if you were if

1539
01:03:04,469 --> 01:03:08,849
you're from kind of like an abusive home

1540
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:09,959
then you are more likely to become to

1541
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:11,519
become a terrorist that let me I'm

1542
01:03:09,959 --> 01:03:13,288
dumbing it down I'm gonna advert I'm not

1543
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,959
gonna advertise the outer as I'm saying

1544
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:17,729
this is just one variable but if you see

1545
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:20,399
it if you if you use this one and many

1546
01:03:17,729 --> 01:03:23,489
others there might but I just say might

1547
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,630
not may might be something to it yeah

1548
01:03:23,489 --> 01:03:28,140
and I would just add to that I mean

1549
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:29,519
maybe vulnerable to manipulation is is

1550
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:33,150
how I would put it as opposed to

1551
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:34,589
exploitation and there's gonna be I

1552
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,969
think we were talking about this last

1553
01:03:34,589 --> 01:03:37,229
night but there's always gonna be a

1554
01:03:35,969 --> 01:03:39,089
percentage of people who are drawn to

1555
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:41,160
violence no matter what you do in the

1556
01:03:39,089 --> 01:03:43,589
world the world is a violent place there

1557
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,989
will always be violent conflict I think

1558
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:47,819
one of the main mistakes that countries

1559
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:49,199
have made is to present to their

1560
01:03:47,819 --> 01:03:51,089
citizens as if they can keep them

1561
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:55,469
completely safe all the time it's just

1562
01:03:51,089 --> 01:03:56,940
I'm true it's simply not true so you

1563
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:58,799
know and we were talking about this

1564
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:01,170
Olivia you said something about security

1565
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,940
services don't get credit for what they

1566
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,829
do and I did say this last night you

1567
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,959
know when we get asked by governments

1568
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:09,150
and ad-hoc conversations well how do we

1569
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:10,739
convince our population to do you know

1570
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:13,079
that we need to take people back or that

1571
01:04:10,739 --> 01:04:15,329
we need to you know engage in preventive

1572
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:17,190
activities I say I understand how

1573
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:19,229
difficult it is for you because if you

1574
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:20,730
make a mistake if you screw up it is on

1575
01:04:19,229 --> 01:04:22,710
the front page of the news

1576
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:24,780
but you for all of the wonderful things

1577
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:26,760
that you do for all of the things that

1578
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:30,720
you prevent there's no it's not on the

1579
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,900
front page every day so to you know to

1580
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,859
bring it back to this particular topic

1581
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:36,060
there's always going to be violence

1582
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:39,029
there's always going to be people drawn

1583
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:44,040
to violent conflict but the opportunity

1584
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:46,680
to join a global organization that's you

1585
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:50,910
know presenting itself as an antithesis

1586
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:53,069
to corruption and to American domination

1587
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:56,819
and all of the other winning strategies

1588
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:59,040
that Isis especially has had is is a new

1589
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:01,050
opportunity it we can compare it to the

1590
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:02,460
Soviet jihad we can compare it to a lot

1591
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:05,099
of things there's not been nothing on

1592
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:08,730
the scale of this that the world has

1593
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:10,770
seen in modern memory and so it is it is

1594
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,420
very complicated and you know maybe this

1595
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:14,579
is a point to end but that's why the

1596
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:16,500
solution is so complicated when people

1597
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:18,630
talk about oh well let's let's take

1598
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:21,150
lessons from gang violence and let's use

1599
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:23,280
them in d radicalization or in thinking

1600
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,869
about how to deal with Isis fighters or

1601
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:27,750
let's talk about what happened with the

1602
01:05:24,869 --> 01:05:28,700
FARC in Colombia the when you talked

1603
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:31,079
about children

1604
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:33,810
nobody would suggest taking child

1605
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:36,390
soldiers who fought in with the LRA in

1606
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:38,099
Uganda and locking them up in print you

1607
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:40,500
know in a prison for 20 years

1608
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:43,380
that wasn't the global conversation but

1609
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:46,099
that what it means to be part of Isis in

1610
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:49,290
the minds of people is so different that

1611
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:52,230
you that it's it's impossible for us to

1612
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:55,470
sort of use the old formulas in how we

1613
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:58,140
think about them I that's a good way to

1614
01:05:55,470 --> 01:06:00,180
end it because I I think for the first

1615
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:02,009
time ever once Isis Isis came into the

1616
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:05,848
game it was like it became synonymous

1617
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:08,579
with evil like Nazi regime was even more

1618
01:06:05,849 --> 01:06:09,930
so than al-qaida which is a there's some

1619
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:12,240
sort of cultural phenomenon that

1620
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:13,950
happened for that to happen well now

1621
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,939
that we've solved all of the world's

1622
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:17,098
de-radicalization

1623
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,800
jihadist problem terrorism problem I
