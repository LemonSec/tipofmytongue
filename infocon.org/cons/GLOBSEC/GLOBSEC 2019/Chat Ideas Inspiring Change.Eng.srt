13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,489
company and even of a website till

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:42,030
recently but he's helped generate ideas

15
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:44,280
for brands for the last 10 15 years that

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,180
have changed the world and so we're

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,829
gonna talk about ideas but maybe tell

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,920
you know since we can't find you online

19
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,800
whoa who you are and what you do and why

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,719
you're doing it okay well thanks for the

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,149
introduction

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,309
so I've run a bunch of different

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,500
companies and projects as Randall

24
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,689
mentioned that have all stem from my

25
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,340
passion which was around what the what

26
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,110
the education system looks like and what

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,720
the future of learning and and how

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,060
people can grow as individuals and I've

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,530
always made it my mantra to kind of

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,200
highlight the successes of the people I

31
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,689
work with rather than maybe take the

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,990
credit for that work or or try and be

33
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,789
bolstered myself in some way so the the

34
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,339
the first kind of thing that I started

35
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,079
with was that the education system when

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,780
I was growing up just really didn't work

37
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,539
for me I was 15 years old really

38
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,700
frustrated I was getting careers advice

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,530
that basically said you're either gonna

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,689
go and be a lawyer or you're gonna go in

41
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,579
stack shelves in a supermarket and so I

42
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,439
wanted to turn that into something that

43
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,139
was I was passionate about and I wanted

44
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,210
to be a journalist actually so I turned

45
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,990
that into I stuck with the Stuckey

46
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:57,030
shelves I think it became this thing

47
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,559
where you know I had a teacher that told

48
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,750
me you your English isn't good enough to

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,020
become a journalist so don't do it

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,579
and I said well no actually you know

51
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,710
what I'm gonna launch a magazine and

52
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,720
when I was 15 years old I ended up

53
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,000
putting together a prospect and launch

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,930
in a magazine that went out there into

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,900
the market and he grew quite

56
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,870
and it was it was ended up featuring

57
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:22,239
very big stars celebrities music fashion

58
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,159
and all sorts of other stuff and it

59
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,019
became quite a big boy wearing heads by

60
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:29,019
the way I know absolutely so this is the

61
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,909
discussion of the two hats I'm gonna

62
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:33,220
have a hat off so I'm gonna keep mine

63
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:37,720
two lashes light of a survey who wears

64
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,489
the better later okay but it was it was

65
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,590
the the main thing for me was that

66
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,120
people weren't being inspired to think

67
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,940
differently about the ways in which they

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,829
could learn and be challenged in doing

69
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,959
that and so what I started doing was

70
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:52,389
profile in other careers to young people

71
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,889
that they could start considering and

72
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:56,650
that led me into doing lots of other

73
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:58,720
campaigns so I grew an organization out

74
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,420
of that a marketing agency we were

75
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,620
headhunted by Google at the time and we

76
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,420
became responsible for delivering

77
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,470
enterprise campaigns all around the

78
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,388
world

79
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,760
then those campaigns were simply

80
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,889
successful because we focused on what

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,899
were the vulnerabilities people had in

82
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:16,049
the the missing skills gaps that they

83
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,370
weren't getting from traditional systems

84
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,560
it's a tell some of the people you've

85
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,629
since advised you you have a quite a

86
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,879
roster who at least ones you could talk

87
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:26,078
about

88
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:28,000
so I guess well the first starting point

89
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:30,790
was you know when Google call you up and

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,260
it was one of the VP's I actually

91
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,790
thought it was a friend just joking

92
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,888
around and I nearly put the phone down

93
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,900
and glad I didn't do it in that instance

94
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,540
but you know Google came to us and said

95
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,060
will you you know help us work with

96
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,470
companies the one to grow online but

97
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,540
this was around a fundamental thing that

98
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,659
actually around the world there's a big

99
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,280
lack of digital skills and Google

100
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,828
actually wanted to be a solution in that

101
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,359
in that piece and I said well we need to

102
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,709
distill this down to what are the

103
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,109
biggest challenges that people perceive

104
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,519
and that was number one that they don't

105
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:02,949
know how to do it they don't have the

106
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,769
skills number two it'll cost too much of

107
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,449
the time or too much money and in quite

108
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,409
simply number three that they don't want

109
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:10,359
to devote the time because they won't

110
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,769
have the time to do it so we said well

111
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:14,139
what does it look like if you turn that

112
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,930
into a product and productize that type

113
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:18,668
of learning and we created an initiative

114
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,310
that has now been rolled out or run the

115
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:23,799
world but even in the UK alone across an

116
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,510
18-month period I think it got one point

117
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,490
sorry across the 12-month period it got

118
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,440
one point eight million

119
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,600
new SMEs online that never been online

120
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,580
before and that project has now become

121
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,590
the global digital skills program that

122
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,539
Google runs and has been running for the

123
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,388
last kind of decade but I mean we work

124
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:41,130
with virgin group the World Bank many

125
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,660
other organizations on different

126
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,849
programs that look at ways in which

127
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,650
fundamentally brands can be useful in

128
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:48,719
people's lives because I think that's

129
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,909
what converts the loyalty and better

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,009
conversion overall is that if a brand

131
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,960
can find a way of being useful which for

132
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,060
me is about being informative which goes

133
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,340
back to how brands actually support

134
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,400
education systems and also difference

135
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,130
between a brand being useful any product

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,560
being useful I understand how my iPhone

137
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,770
is useful I'm not sure how Apple is

138
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,810
useful that's a good question so I think

139
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,460
that fundamentally should come down to

140
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,300
what are the values of the company

141
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,190
behind the product and that is that if a

142
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,409
company really wants loyalty and really

143
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:24,509
wants conversion then truly to engage

144
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,280
they need to look at the impact they're

145
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,190
having in the life of that consumer

146
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,320
beyond the product and that is that I

147
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,340
think people are realizing

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,650
sustainability and sustainable economies

149
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,630
that it comes down to what you can do to

150
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,099
be useful in the day to day life so

151
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,349
whether or not that's being more

152
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,210
socially conscious socially aware or

153
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:44,219
ethical for the environment in your

154
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:46,020
footprint or whether that's educating

155
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,509
consumers in a new way you know if

156
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,859
you're a financial services company

157
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,270
actually the really exciting thing could

158
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,759
be how you support people's financial

159
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,889
literacy or how you know in different

160
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,360
fin tech innovations right now you can

161
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,509
start looking at what a brand is doing

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,409
in in helping you to save money

163
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,759
fundamentally by looking at your

164
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:04,289
spending habits and what you're doing

165
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,150
day to day so I think it's all about

166
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,310
where you serve a purpose at different

167
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,049
points in time in someone's life

168
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,849
suctions were talking the this panels

169
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,650
about ideas and driving change through

170
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:16,919
ideas

171
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,210
Forbes turned a hundred that 18 months

172
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,830
ago is our hundredth birthday we look

173
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,630
pretty good 400 and so we surveyed we

174
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,370
did a featured in the hunt it was a

175
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,310
hundred greatest living business minds

176
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,580
and we got almost all of money just

177
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:34,409
gates and Buffett and Branson and all

178
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,620
around the world you know lee kai-shing

179
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:42,170
and

180
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:47,170
and the we asked all of them what's an

181
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:51,170
idea for the future that that we can

182
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:53,420
take and and look for and and we got a

183
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,920
lot of similar answers I want to kind of

184
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,680
put some of these to you and figure out

185
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,540
how this translate into what you hear

186
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,910
and how we can use these these new

187
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,920
technologies that are gonna change and

188
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,850
turn them into positive change because

189
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,710
that's what we heard a lot this morning

190
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,180
about the need for that so you know

191
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,650
number one is AI everyone's talking

192
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,200
about AI I don't think there's any

193
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,239
surprise there but it's so first so AI

194
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,590
how's this couldn't effect everything

195
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,030
that you're working on everything that

196
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,810
everybody in this room was working on

197
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,969
when we're talking about the

198
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:24,260
cross-section of corporations

199
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:26,690
entrepreneurs government NGOs etc so I

200
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,210
think that's fundamental to the future

201
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:31,490
of Education and in fact the future of

202
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,099
service provision overall for me is that

203
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,750
AI what goes behind the idea of

204
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,230
artificial intelligence and and what

205
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,310
we're looking at is you know essentially

206
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,140
there needs to be some sort of code of

207
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,580
ethics I believe in fact in terms of

208
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,560
what people are applying and what that

209
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,109
looks like because when you interpret

210
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,000
artificial intelligence as a product or

211
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,130
service in someone's life particularly

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,770
in the education system you start

213
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:56,900
actually you know automatically by

214
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,890
definition dictating what something else

215
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,840
is deciding for you and so there comes a

216
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,820
point where in globally governments big

217
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,010
corporations need to start looking at

218
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,590
where as a level of responsibility lie

219
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:11,539
in terms of how their AI has an impact

220
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,729
on what people do next because you've

221
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,410
got some pretty amazing instances now

222
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,300
which if we talk about the youth of

223
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:20,120
today coming forward into new learning

224
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,150
models you've got the idea of looking at

225
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,590
deep fake so deep fake technology if

226
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,659
anybody's hear about it or isn't

227
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,340
familiar with it is this idea the best

228
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,620
example most recently is of the Mona

229
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,720
Lisa and the Mona Lisa

230
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,039
I think if Samsung has just created some

231
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,560
technology that they've applied with

232
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,870
their deep fake brand which brings the

233
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,030
Mona Lisa to life and this is by just

234
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,070
taking one singular bit of mapping of

235
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,900
the Mona Lisa and essentially it creates

236
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,070
an animated version of it which could

237
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,510
look like there were many different

238
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,670
types of the Mona Lisa painted that have

239
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,360
never been painted before if you're than

240
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,829
a young person

241
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,810
that's growing up in an education system

242
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,699
showing you many different types of the

243
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,079
Mona Lisa doing something when you

244
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,970
weren't really familiar with the fact

245
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,140
there was only ever one Mona Lisa but

246
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,149
then actually you've got a completely

247
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,890
different interpretation of society and

248
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:05,810
what that what that character or

249
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,689
caricature of a Mona Lisa actually is

250
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,719
and it while it engages people in the

251
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,089
format because actually you know you can

252
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,730
take people to the the Louvre in Paris

253
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:19,310
and and go and see it you know you're

254
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,899
gonna engage a young person much more by

255
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,680
bringing that to life and animating it

256
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,390
in the way that they're currently

257
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,459
talking about then you might actually

258
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,839
just in the basis of taking people there

259
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,229
but I love about you Glen is you're so

260
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:34,310
optimistic because depict technology

261
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,290
also has a tremendous potential to

262
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,180
disrupt democracy by just creating fake

263
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,029
videos and you know you're gonna show

264
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,439
you know president kiss cuz you know

265
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:43,850
just you know swimming in the Danube

266
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,910
right now and then you could just create

267
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,560
total fiction so you immediately go to

268
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:52,040
how we could teach children which is

269
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,560
great but then how do you harness that

270
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,149
so it's not used for ill I mean I

271
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,229
there's no war right there's no one

272
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:02,209
answer of course but how do we keep you

273
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,140
know what is it as you look to what you

274
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:05,750
were talking about in the beginning in

275
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,519
this you know that you know we need to

276
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,130
work together to put ethical guidelines

277
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,110
on AI you go to the positive but how do

278
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,820
we prevent the negative what's well you

279
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,920
know what in this room which has a lot

280
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,589
of governmental leaders in it and

281
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,390
corporate leaders do that is the real

282
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,370
the real challenge and I guess that's

283
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:24,589
why I started with the idea that you

284
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,260
know we need to look at fundamentally

285
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:30,019
the responsibilities behind how AI is

286
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,000
applied and that is the the secret here

287
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:34,730
that potentially that's an international

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,190
code of ethics behind how AI is applied

289
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,709
and and who is responsible for the

290
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,300
actions that occur out of that because

291
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:43,399
as you've said you can that can very

292
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,290
much lead to you know a video of a

293
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,209
president a global leader actually

294
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,699
saying something that they never in fact

295
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:51,199
said at all I mean we've got already got

296
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,399
instances where people are saying

297
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:54,260
they've never said certain things that

298
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
they've said anyway but actually you've

299
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,800
got this new world where you know AI is

300
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,660
going to say things for you which is

301
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,390
particularly terrifying in some

302
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,439
instances so you know this is all comes

303
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,540
down to how

304
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,910
I'm moderating by the way hey I got it

305
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,949
from here I know we're we're out of jobs

306
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,380
we don't need to do this I think that

307
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,990
the the really exciting thing is

308
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,150
actually when we look at the impact

309
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,490
AI can have on markets that haven't been

310
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:21,890
able to afford access to traditional

311
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:24,170
models of Education and that is in in

312
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,760
parts of remote parts of Africa or

313
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,770
different parts of India for instance as

314
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,660
two examples of two places that I've

315
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,900
been recently looking at education

316
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:35,680
formats this is basically that these

317
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,360
places went through a technological jump

318
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,189
and that is that one of the big stats

319
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,900
that sticks in my head from from India

320
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,790
in particular was the power of

321
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,160
e-commerce in teaching people new skills

322
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,839
and I think there was I'm gonna get the

323
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,550
actual figures wrong but they're they're

324
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,370
pretty huge here so it went from

325
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,930
something like 20% of of transactions in

326
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,290
India happening in an online environment

327
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,540
to almost 80% within a period of a few

328
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,790
years and that was down to the

329
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,380
availability of smart phones and I

330
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,829
fundamentally actually the the

331
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,020
availability of cheap data not cheap

332
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,550
affordable data and we've now got a

333
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,199
tremendous shift that we're going to see

334
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,329
in the ways in which that's going to

335
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,920
completely revolutionize access to

336
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,240
education in markets they never had well

337
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,430
one of the other things that came up is

338
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,090
5g you just kind of walked right into it

339
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:25,489
to what's how is that you know how

340
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,780
quickly is that gonna take and how from

341
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:30,080
where you're sitting is that gonna

342
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:32,180
change things and how so

343
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,200
5g you know there's been a buzz thing

344
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,479
that lots of governments have been

345
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,300
talking about for the last 5-10 years

346
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,060
even the main thing to do here is never

347
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,430
ever think about comparing 5g to 4G or

348
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,819
3G because you you really can't compare

349
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,780
the two

350
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:50,540
5g essentially when rolled out will give

351
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:53,209
us it's promised up to a hundred times

352
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,849
the speed of 4G what that actually means

353
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,860
in terms of impact in our lives is that

354
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,800
we're going to see unprecedented

355
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,570
processing power so I think a really

356
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,920
good example to give here would be

357
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,160
something like the agricultural industry

358
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,770
so the agricultural industry something

359
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,089
like 25 24 million connected devices

360
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:15,120
exist right now in the world

361
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:16,589
in between now and 2020 for that's

362
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,319
predicted to be a few hundred million

363
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:21,990
something like 225 million connected

364
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:23,459
devices because of 5g what that does is

365
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:26,249
changes the way that people manage their

366
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,420
time manage what they learn but also the

367
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:30,509
automation of that

368
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:33,209
so what 5g brings with it in its in its

369
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:35,189
promise behind all the hype is an idea

370
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:36,989
that we're gonna have easier better

371
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,998
facilitated lies and better to our

372
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,769
access to different resources but

373
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:44,249
alongside that of course comes a really

374
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:45,449
big impact upon skills and the the

375
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:47,790
largest impact that that's going to

376
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:50,639
create is that within the next two

377
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,290
decades it's estimated by some different

378
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,389
sources I think the Economist was one

379
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:58,469
there recently quoted this that actually

380
00:13:54,389 --> 00:14:01,439
nearly 50% of all jobs is 47% I think in

381
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:05,069
the Economist quotation 47% of all jobs

382
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:07,410
won't will will have the ability to be

383
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:10,259
completely automated within the next

384
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,089
couple of decades which is a terrifying

385
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:13,860
prospect but actually this isn't about

386
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:15,809
scare mongering the technology is going

387
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,579
to mean that everyone's jobs are gone

388
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:20,309
and taken over by robots this is a

389
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,290
really huge opportunity to create a

390
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,969
whole different service set and in

391
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,279
Europe actually the European Union has

392
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,220
got some fantastic initiatives around 5g

393
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,920
one of them is around a brilliant

394
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,110
initiative using lampposts so this is

395
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,179
your everyday street lights but actually

396
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,129
these are going to become the 5g beacons

397
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,689
around the rest of Europe but where

398
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:42,029
you'll put the different receivers to

399
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:43,829
allow people to engage and interact with

400
00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,899
different types of public services and

401
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,638
you know not just to know in a few

402
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:49,290
seconds or in a refresh of an app if

403
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,449
something if your bus is turning up but

404
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:53,339
actually how that service is impacting

405
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:54,719
is it too full what's happening with it

406
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:56,939
and all of the different other datasets

407
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,649
that you maybe didn't have access to at

408
00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:01,889
your fingertips before but it's the

409
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:04,259
delivery of that service of 5g across

410
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:05,999
global markets that that didn't have

411
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,189
that infrastructure of broadband

412
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:09,779
there are jump in literally generations

413
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:11,550
and are going to have this technology

414
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,019
thrust at them where they haven't heard

415
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:16,139
the development that other markets have

416
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:18,209
and that's a real transformation in in

417
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,740
educational learning models particularly

418
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,679
when you deal with for instance a rural

419
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,449
school that has just done things using

420
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,040
textbooks and now suddenly will

421
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:27,780
eventually have access to this

422
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,610
g-technology that's gonna completely

423
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:32,610
transform the way they look good that's

424
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,770
the the half full exam which is great we

425
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,570
have a question on slide oh and again

426
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,100
please keep asking questions around of

427
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,840
conversation with everybody here it's a

428
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,930
nice small room or we could do that

429
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,520
about you know I mean 5g obviously gives

430
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:48,239
unlimited bandwidth and we talked about

431
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:51,270
AI really changing things the question

432
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,220
is whether government you know we talked

433
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:56,130
about codes of ethics for the government

434
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:59,370
could use start to harness this

435
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:03,390
unlimited computing power and processing

436
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:07,610
power Nai against its own citizens you

437
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:09,420
think about that that's a big question

438
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:13,890
yeah that's a big question

439
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,750
um so we're already seeing I will call

440
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:19,290
it some of the scare mongering stories

441
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:21,210
around China which is that actually

442
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:25,230
there's the development already

443
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:28,380
happening of credit based systems around

444
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:30,540
how good a citizen you are or aunt I

445
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,780
find out it actually a terrifying

446
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,459
prospect that there I might be mapped by

447
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,470
the way in which I engage with other

448
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,080
parts of society and that will there

449
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,090
foot it'll really earth cook cookies

450
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,190
well indeed actually well that's a whole

451
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:46,890
other topic but there's we'll come back

452
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,840
to that one but I think the the the

453
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,540
really fascinating thing here is that

454
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,700
you know we're good we're going into

455
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,829
this world where yes governments are

456
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,110
watching our every move we are being

457
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,880
analyzed we are being looked at there is

458
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,190
more data available Barriss than ever

459
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,630
before I think where this comes into its

460
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,760
own is really when you deal with the

461
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,400
younger generation who know no different

462
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,970
from that and from that environment and

463
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,190
that's where you know you see I guess

464
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,260
that Instagram generation that have only

465
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,310
grown up knowing those models they're

466
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,720
comfortable you know they like being

467
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,760
targeted they're like oh these ads are

468
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,100
just for me good they would they would

469
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,730
probably revolt if they started getting

470
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:28,169
ads on in their feed for you know old

471
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,650
person pills or something they're like

472
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,900
no I want what I want I mean how much I

473
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,970
mean you know something we obviously

474
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,500
focus on a Forbes you know and we ever

475
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,100
concurrent under 30 something going on

476
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,179
here bro

477
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,879
clever this week whether or not this

478
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,559
generation is in a position to you know

479
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,020
solve a lot of these problems but also

480
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,970
they are being created by them I mean

481
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,250
there's they're surrounded and so it's

482
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,179
kind of which way you know which way do

483
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,549
you go because when you have a

484
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:59,280
generation that is completely used to

485
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:03,090
being you know having their data shared

486
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,399
all the time do they be do they give are

487
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,080
they at peace with it because they're

488
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,710
used to it or do or they the ones who

489
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,658
solve it because they fundamentally

490
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,429
understand the power of it so this is

491
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,620
when you have to try and look at the the

492
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:18,600
owner a young gentleman on the 35 Glen

493
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,979
is a young you know so you can also

494
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,840
speak for the youth ish I I think that

495
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,730
that becomes a thing where you have to

496
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,199
take the view of education overall and

497
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,450
what does that look like for young

498
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,370
people in terms of what they accept so

499
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,809
this is about whether or not we argue

500
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,969
that young people overall becoming

501
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,110
disengaged on mainstream models mine is

502
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,750
that you know I didn't go to university

503
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:42,120
I went straight from 15 into setting up

504
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,980
my business model and that was because I

505
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,629
didn't like the way the education system

506
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,460
was going to take four years for me to

507
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:49,919
learn how to be a journalist you know

508
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,270
and I'll say that's continuous learning

509
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,690
and evolution I don't know if you agree

510
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:57,480
but I mean the trade it's it's something

511
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,270
that you know we look at attention spans

512
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,669
and actually what what there is now an

513
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,740
opportunity for is to reinvent models of

514
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,360
education so there's this thing around

515
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,309
whether or not education should be

516
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,080
completely transformed I don't think

517
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:11,789
it's it's a whole transformation it's an

518
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,770
evolution alongside different types of

519
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:16,530
Technology and about whether or not

520
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:18,120
somebody accepts being tracked or where

521
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,129
their online identity is and what their

522
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,928
looks like actually this is I'm going to

523
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,640
go with the half full approach this is

524
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:25,500
an opportunity for personalization of

525
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,510
learning and we've heard a lot in the

526
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
past about personalization of tech but

527
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,879
this is a real opportunity for

528
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,580
personalization learning I'll give you

529
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,070
just a couple of examples so I've just

530
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,158
become a brand ambassador for an

531
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,539
education tech company and they've been

532
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:45,000
doing some amazing projects

533
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:46,740
I don't what other jobs brand about to

534
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,290
go to the office every day is like I

535
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,820
work hard I work on one of those

536
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,039
projects that we did

537
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,668
been doing is called beats not blades

538
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,169
and this was about different parts of as

539
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,690
you might imagine disenfranchised

540
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:02,669
disengaged youth in different parts of

541
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,980
society that had no interest in

542
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,409
education systems before but had been

543
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:10,049
using music to learn different parts of

544
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:11,759
the curriculum and that project has has

545
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:13,080
absolutely transformed the lives of

546
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:14,730
those individuals but there's a there's

547
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,259
a whole argument there then what could

548
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,419
the role of the music industry be more

549
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,710
widely in being able again to be useful

550
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,600
in people's lives they're trying to find

551
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,570
a new types of relevance and new ways

552
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,879
forward but this model of actually using

553
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,189
music and other types of learning

554
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:31,259
methodology to apply to individuals

555
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,120
needs has been transformative in

556
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,799
different parts of society and we're

557
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,539
working with tens of thousands of young

558
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,668
people in different types of projects

559
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,769
that implement these sorts of things in

560
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:42,870
in the one client of mine you mentioned

561
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:45,809
which is his virgin group we did a

562
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,008
project the Virgin wanted to look to

563
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:49,350
work with more young people and

564
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:50,970
encourage young talent to grow and I

565
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,529
said we'll again the way in which to do

566
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,659
that is to be useful in young people's

567
00:20:52,529 --> 00:20:56,269
lives because virgin as a brand was

568
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:59,309
looking for the next thing it was doing

569
00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:02,009
so I said well why don't we create our

570
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:03,720
own qualification like a brand making

571
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:06,330
its own qualification that's the

572
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,460
equivalent the equivalent level of half

573
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:10,740
an a-level in the UK so I said why don't

574
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,360
we do this where we challenge young

575
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,690
people to make their own business but

576
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:17,399
this is all about making people look at

577
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,009
learning in ways where you don't relate

578
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:21,719
it to traditional learning so we created

579
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:23,250
a structure where we did a call out and

580
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,779
we said what would it look like if a

581
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,179
young girl himself as an unconventional

582
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,620
learner I mean he's absolutely why was

583
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:31,019
that mean the perfect figurehead for us

584
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,008
to work with but this was like we said

585
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:33,899
well what would it look like if young

586
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:36,570
people made their own festival and they

587
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:38,070
made that happen so we built this this

588
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,450
whole course that was built around

589
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,700
actually what was it an online business

590
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,409
plan without the people as participants

591
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,600
realizing that they were being told to

592
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:47,250
make a marketing strategy a financial

593
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,240
plan and all these other bits because if

594
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,529
they were pushed with that as one

595
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,970
overall piece maybe they wouldn't have

596
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:52,649
engaged with the project but we

597
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,720
challenged this and said we are then

598
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:56,459
gonna reward you with going and be a

599
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,769
mentor to different music festivals

600
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,269
learning how to work the trade and these

601
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:01,409
young people that are engaged in this I

602
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:03,210
mean we thought we were going to have a

603
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:03,960
few thousand entries across six month

604
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,330
period

605
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,179
we had over 10,000 in the first 24 hours

606
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:11,158
so it blew us away that actually young

607
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,860
people when you really inspire them to

608
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,539
learn I'm more than willing and that

609
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,459
said to me the traditional education

610
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:19,259
needed to reassess the way it was being

611
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,909
delivered but it also talks to you know

612
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,730
you know we only have a few more minutes

613
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:24,990
but a talk it speaks to the future of

614
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,139
work I mean we had one we have a

615
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:33,690
question that came in from McHale about

616
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:35,729
whether or not humans you know well you

617
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,980
know which jobs will be here and will

618
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,480
not be able to be replaced by AI it

619
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,159
speaks to what you're just talking about

620
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,970
which is you know creativity and the

621
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,769
idea that a I will never will be able to

622
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,360
create things they you know won't be

623
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:51,779
able to spark things that the human

624
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,070
brain can't and so you know maybe

625
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:54,059
there's some hope in that I mean I don't

626
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,678
know if you have any thoughts on

627
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:59,369
creativity and that you know the future

628
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:02,190
of you know it's our it's our best asset

629
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:05,309
I hope absolutely I agree I mean that's

630
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:07,379
well picking up on kind of that point I

631
00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,450
think if everybody in this audience here

632
00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:11,340
if I asked you right who in the audience

633
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,659
considers themselves creative if you put

634
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,559
raise your hand if you consider yourself

635
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:19,710
creative we've got a reasonable

636
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,408
reasonable effort half half enough so my

637
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:23,909
challenge would be for anyone who didn't

638
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:27,360
put their hands up why do you consider

639
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:29,129
who told you you're not creative and the

640
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,779
really interesting thing there is again

641
00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:33,449
what the traditional education system

642
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:35,909
has conditioned us to believe a creative

643
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,340
person is a non creative person a person

644
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:40,529
good at math or not good at math is and

645
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,749
this is is fundamentally for me what I

646
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:45,269
think is wrong with the existing system

647
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:46,919
that for me creativity is the ability to

648
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:49,110
problem-solve and every single one of us

649
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,789
in this room in our jobs learns how to

650
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,229
problem-solve and that is

651
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:54,389
problem-solving effectively and you know

652
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,369
creativity it makes the world go round

653
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:57,809
and that for me is just having a

654
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:00,749
completely different approach as to how

655
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:02,129
we view this and as to is AI taking our

656
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:04,470
jobs what are the ones that are going to

657
00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:07,289
exist in the future that's again down to

658
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:09,269
how that person decides to interpret

659
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:11,429
what their view of usefulness to a

660
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:13,799
client is I had somebody that I was

661
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:15,210
working with a banking client and I went

662
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:16,499
in and I was talking to the asset

663
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,730
finance team and I said what do you

664
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:20,639
perceive to be the biggest child

665
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:23,010
in your role and eventually I teased out

666
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:24,299
of him that he realized that it was

667
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,679
going to take him two weeks to come back

668
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,539
with the answer on it on funding

669
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,399
somebody that an application was going

670
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:30,510
to tell them within the hour and I said

671
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,860
well you've already answered your own

672
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,870
questions to where your job might be in

673
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,399
a few years time if you don't look at

674
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:37,260
other ways you can be useful to that

675
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:39,449
client but he already didn't realize

676
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,799
that he's got the ability to be useful

677
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,210
to that client he's just not unlocked

678
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,799
the ways in which he could do it and

679
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,750
that's he could do partnership

680
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:47,610
configuration for many many other things

681
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,710
but that's about just viewing ways in

682
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:52,229
which we up skill because we're not that

683
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,789
that skills gap piece is that we're not

684
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,159
just gonna be faced with the the

685
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:59,100
previous generations the statistic about

686
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,990
nearly 50% of people being jobs being

687
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,928
automated in the future is matched by

688
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:06,809
one that currently fifty-three percent

689
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:08,850
roughly 53 percent of all existing

690
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:11,250
people within the global workforce needs

691
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,049
to be rescaled or up skilled that is a

692
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,820
phenomenal statistic and that is again

693
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,289
within the next couple of decades so

694
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,908
what we're really looking at here is how

695
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:19,529
do we deal with the middle skills gap

696
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:23,700
that we're going to be creating by the

697
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:26,309
advancements of Technology a little bit

698
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:29,279
of pessimism that's refreshing but

699
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:31,019
mostly optimism from Glenn peggeleh

700
