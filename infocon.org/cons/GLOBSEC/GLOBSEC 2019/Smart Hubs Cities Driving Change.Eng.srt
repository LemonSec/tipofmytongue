2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:11,099
yes good morning everyone and and thank

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,259
you for joining us my name is kathleen

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,369
koch and I will be your moderator today

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,439
and we're here to talk about cities

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:22,230
right now it's more than half of the

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,948
world's population lives in cities and

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:29,670
the prediction is that by 2050 we'll be

9
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,650
68 percent so the question we're going

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,469
to be exploring here today is really how

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,930
do we handle this massive urban

12
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,360
expansion in a controlled and

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,899
sustainable way can can technology help

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,510
and and how will these new urban centers

15
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,730
how will they evolve will they become

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,489
hubs smart hubs of innovation so I have

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,910

rather extraordinary because you you

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,079
were campaigning with a plan and this

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,369
was not a short plan a 300-page

39
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,850
Bratislava plan put together by 30

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,450
what is your vision how do you want to

45
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,280
make Bratislava different as it moves

46
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,839

whole world and of course we we made a

54
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:37,940
plan Bratislava as you said was made by

55
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:41,800
76 in the end and the professionals from

56
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:44,720
different levels of city government and

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,190
there was there was maybe there was

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,830
something different because everybody

59
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,769
told me before I I start my campaign you

60
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,769
need to be a face who knows like every

61
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:57,620
very well-known face and you need to be

62
00:02:54,769 --> 00:03:00,560
in television and I said no I would like

63
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,860
to try to go with program and in this

64
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,910
kind of Central Europe in election the

65
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:10,819
program is is for somebody's maybe to

66
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,980
old school or just everybody said the

67
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:15,679
famous spin-doctors from different

68
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,840
agencies we always say nobody listened

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,250
to the program but anyway we tried it

70
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,650
and we in the end there was a in the end

71
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:27,709
the property saw is a huge six hundred

72
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,540
page document on internet on internet

73
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,780
movie and we published the book which is

74
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,060
three hundred page big and is more

75
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,579
accessible for for common public let's

76
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,500
say now so how is it going what I

77
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,750
realize you've only been in office how

78
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,430
many months now actually after tomorrow

79
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,140
is six months six months right and I

80
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,870
know it's you can't expect a lot I'm

81
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,190
sorry today actually today Sigma happy

82
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,790
anniversary

83
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,410
so can you tell us about just briefly

84
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,600
the progress you're making on any of the

85
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,030
points in the plan concrete progress at

86
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,340
this point I need to say that I have

87
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,140
decided it is if I want to do something

88
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,010
in very good way I need to have a good

89
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,899
plan and the team but after six months I

90
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,790
need to say that I'm so happy I have

91
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,810
this book I have this menu because in

92
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,328
the end is a manual for better

93
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,488
Bratislava and I'm just following

94
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,829
everyday the steps of it brought in so

95
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:22,460
it's a road map it's a road map and it's

96
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,599
it's my only help I have because there

97
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,120
are so many problems in the city

98
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:27,300
everybody knows it and to talk about the

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,430
future the strategy

100
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,039
the vision there is no real time during

101
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,270
this month so so I'm so glad to have it

102
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,960
and we are with Almighty we follow it we

103
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,560
following it very closely

104
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,469
Jana I'd like to ask you to help for us

105
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,520
to define the concept of smart cities

106
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,210
we're going to be talking about that a

107
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,340
lot today so what is a smart city what

108
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,370
does that actually entail and how do you

109
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:57,599
retrofit an existing municipality to

110
00:04:53,370 --> 00:05:00,449
make it smart yes we we refer to smart

111
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:03,180
cities in terms of adding digital

112
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:05,099
intelligence to achieve better quality

113
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,500
of life outcomes that's that's really

114
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:10,680
what it is about and that has three

115
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:13,349
layers it has the most commonly referred

116
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,789
to traditional technology layer which is

117
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:19,830
about networked sensors and devices

118
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:22,560
which is also then a good part of the

119
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:26,190
retrofitting say cameras along the

120
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,590
streets to give an example but it is

121
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,919
also very importantly two more layers so

122
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:35,698
one is or the second one is the data

123
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,520
analytics and applications without which

124
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:42,419
the sensors and networks don't do much

125
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:46,440
good so to give an example from from

126
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,758
crime incidence if you had use the

127
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,039
cameras for instance for gunshot

128
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,460
detection that would be an application

129
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,919
and data analytics but then thirdly and

130
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,008
as importantly it's about usage and

131
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,250
changing behavior so to stay with that

132
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,469
example if you then deployed for

133
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,259
instance predictive policing where you

134
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:09,539
know from the big data analysis there is

135
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,490
going to be some incidents or high

136
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,009
likelihood of a some incident in an area

137
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:17,719
you actually massively change their

138
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,580
crime outcomes in the city on that point

139
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:24,120
your organization becomes a global

140
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,940
Institute last year studied how dozens

141
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,849
of Smart City applications if they put

142
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,500
them to use how they would impact three

143
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:32,840
sample cities and I have to share these

144
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,759
numbers because they're fabulous

145
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,080
they found the tools would reduce

146
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,220
fatalities by eight to ten percent

147
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,180
accelerate emergency

148
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:48,590
times in those cities by 20 to 35%

149
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:51,720
shorten the average commute by 15 to 20%

150
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,270
lower the disease burden by 8 to 15

151
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,320
percent and cut greenhouse gas emissions

152
00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:00,930
by 10 to 15 percent and those are just

153
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,590
some of the positive outcomes that they

154
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:06,900
found Volvo I know that the European

155
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,719
Investment Bank has created a smart

156
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,729
cities and regions initiatives you're a

157
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,980
real leader in financing projects like

158
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,770
this I mean with numbers like those that

159
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,420
I just cited you must have cities

160
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,039
banging down the door saying make us

161
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,050
smart we want to be the next smart city

162
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,600
so how do you choose how do you select

163
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,210
the cities that you take on and are they

164
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,610
always the largest cities are we talking

165
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:35,190
second-tier cities where do you see the

166
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:39,150
highest degree of success maybe just

167
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,520
taking a step one step back I think I

168
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,469
like the phrase think globally act

169
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,870
locally and I think this very much

170
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,270
applies to to cities and to local

171
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,570
regional development what we see when we

172
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,880
look at the cities is a kind of two

173
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,980
dimension issue on one hand cities

174
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,650
represent as you mentioned a big part of

175
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,710
the global population according to the

176
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,070
OECD forecast by to some 100 it should

177
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,989
be 85 percent of global population

178
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,480
cities generate approximately 82 percent

179
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,669
of global GDP but on the other hand

180
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,960
since these also generate sixty five

181
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:17,760
percent of co2 emissions so you can on

182
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,560
one hand see the challenges in terms of

183
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,060
environment in terms of transport I

184
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,650
think the mayor experienced the

185
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,400
transport in Bratislava this morning and

186
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:30,419
some of us as well

187
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:32,699
he made a good experience and of course

188
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,880
we have issues related to related to

189
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,650
migration to social cohesion etc but on

190
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,380
the other hand also you see cities as

191
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:43,260
real sources and hubs of innovation hubs

192
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,370
of dynamics for economy and this is

193
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,350
something which you're going to utilize

194
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,740
also through financing and supporting

195
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:52,830
so-called smart cities concept the way

196
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,850
how we define is the best we don't

197
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,980
differentiate too much between the big

198
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,620
small cities and actually when we did an

199
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,110
analysis of cities in Central Eastern

200
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,139
Europe we came is the conclusion that

201
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,029
the market gap which exists in terms of

202
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:10,000
financing in terms of potential are

203
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:12,029
so-called second-tier cities so there is

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,680
if you were you were to fill the gaps

205
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:17,500
because we are public Development Bank

206
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,209
so our role is not to replace commercial

207
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,040
banking and the private sources of

208
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,810
financing which are available but to

209
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,110
really focus on those gaps because it's

210
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:27,729
the end market for us small city second

211
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,829
30 cities it doesn't mean that we

212
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,630
exclude rata Slovak sure we have very

213
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:33,729
strong as man knows very strong

214
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:35,470
cooperation with Bratislava and the

215
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,940
capital cities but we believe that there

216
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:41,319
is a huge potential in the second-tier

217
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,690
cities area and for those we are trying

218
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:45,459
to create so-called innocent platforms

219
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,589
basically a way how we pour resources

220
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,449
and how we work especially with the

221
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:51,370
National Development Bank's to provide

222
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,620
bigger pools of money which can be then

223
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,269
translated into financing for specific

224
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,089
smart solutions for for cities and

225
00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:02,319
regions interesting so andreas I

226
00:09:58,089 --> 00:10:04,120
understand that BMW back in 2010 started

227
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:06,579
a very interesting project you started

228
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,019
dialoguing with cities around the world

229
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:13,149
about their problems and looking at how

230
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,880
BMW could perhaps help them with those

231
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:18,370
and so over that time you visited some

232
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,259
three dozen cities and you most recently

233
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,259
been looking at the issue of mobility

234
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:25,329
what were you hearing as you went around

235
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:28,600
the world and talked to these cities

236
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:31,779
about their struggles what did the BMW

237
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,060
Group learn from that yeah I think you

238
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:36,730
could thing and thanks for for being

239
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,719
here thanks for making the drive drove

240
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:41,470
down last night

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,019
yeah Berlin I had to because my flight

242
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:48,759
was canceled and before I answer your

243
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:50,589
question just one anecdotal observation

244
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,750
that I had yesterday also in Berlin just

245
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:54,939
to show where we are currently you know

246
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,579
everybody talks about smart cities but I

247
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:58,890
drove yesterday through one of the

248
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:03,640
longer

249
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:06,600
streets of roads of Berlin probably six

250
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,600
seven kilometres long

251
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:18,730
I drove Volkswagen when I was a teenager

252
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:20,560
since then I've changed my habits now

253
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,600
Quinn's coincidentally I felt the

254
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,119
comfort and beauty of the BMW I was

255
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,130
sitting in but just to be serious here

256
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,779
so everybody talks about smart cities

257
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:33,010
when I drove down that long stretch of

258
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,930
road in Berlin probably every 800 meters

259
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:39,360
to 1 kilometer there was a traffic light

260
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:43,180
and yes you can guess I had to stop at

261
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,140
pretty everyone every of these traffic

262
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:49,870
lights so the status quo is not that

263
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,850
these cities are smart right the status

264
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,620
quo is actually that many of the

265
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,900
possibilities and potentials that we

266
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,850
have already today and not actually

267
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,439
utilized for whatever reason you know I

268
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,089
don't want to judge here there are

269
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,780
cities that do a better job there are

270
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:07,360
cities that do a less good job but you

271
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,300
know the basics at times are not yet

272
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,160
there and was nobility one of the issues

273
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,349
that cities were struggling with the

274
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,750
most when you talk to them well you know

275
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:19,570
we we did we did these stakeholder

276
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:22,120
dialogues in the with the attitude of

277
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,980
listening so it was not like you know

278
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,830
here comes BMW have all the solutions

279
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,690
don't worry anymore but we rather want

280
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,810
to understand what is happening in the

281
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,990
cities because cities are important for

282
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:37,630
us because of them reasons mentioned but

283
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,080
also and very much so because that our

284
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,209
customers actually in these cities so

285
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,800
it's about GDP it's about innovation but

286
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:47,050
it's also about customers so we want to

287
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,660
understand what they think but we also

288
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:53,130
took senior experts from city

289
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:58,180
governments we asked students we asked

290
00:12:53,130 --> 00:13:00,459
the general population and clearly the

291
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,189
top priority for everyone as seamless

292
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,869
mobility so it's not about the actual

293
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,300
means of transportation anymore it's not

294
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,790
about - I want to have a car do I prefer

295
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,040
the bus or whatever I just want to have

296
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:15,009
the most convenient

297
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,490
probably the best priced and at times

298
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:21,550
also the least a mission-driven way to

299
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:24,399
move from A to B and that's the task

300
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,109
that we see coming really is to to let's

301
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,670
say to match different modes of

302
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:31,509
transportation in order to give the

303
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:34,569
customer the best way to move from A to

304
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:37,329
B what that means for a car company is a

305
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:40,360
is a question certainly for us right now

306
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:42,969
fascinating much I'm going to give you

307
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,670
the opportunity because andreas brought

308
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,490
up the the the issue that you had

309
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,829
getting here so how is Bratislava

310
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,529
addressing that the challenge of

311
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:59,258
mobility getting in and out of the city

312
00:13:53,529 --> 00:14:02,290
in a speedy non emitting way firstly I

313
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:04,509
want to say that even if I very

314
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,420
appreciate it this new level of

315
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:10,660
technology which which city must be work

316
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:14,740
with I'm always very very careful with

317
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:16,600
expression smart cities it's always is

318
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,339
always and if we are talking about the

319
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,439
smart cities always ended somebody want

320
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:23,920
to sell me some software you know so so

321
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:26,410
in a way I prefer or in our environment

322
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,149
or group of people who are who are we

323
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,240
are talking on a European level about

324
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:33,339
the cities I prefer like thinking cities

325
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,279
or something like the cities who are

326
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,439
able to judge the best way or to find

327
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,509
the best solution sometimes is the old

328
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:43,990
school way many times these are the new

329
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:46,120
technologies involved and and of course

330
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,920
I'm glad you said that we are not

331
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,870
talking we are talking we are using

332
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,029
expression mobility as well that's the

333
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,290
main way also in problem but at least

334
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:56,740
our plan we are always using this

335
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,809
because in the end it's about how we are

336
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,420
moving from A to B in our city and

337
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:03,819
people want to do that

338
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,610
maybe with not so many money and in very

339
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:09,309
quick and safe wave and in Bratislava

340
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:11,379
the the aim is clear I'm the big fan and

341
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:14,019
there was also in my campaign that the

342
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:17,529
public transport is the is the way it's

343
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:20,050
funny that we are only like 40 50

344
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:22,269
kilometers from Vienna which is in many

345
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:25,149
many levels the best in the world and I

346
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:25,329
actually this week had official meeting

347
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,519
with

348
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:30,128
the mayor of Vienna so I spent the whole

349
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,929
day in Vienna and we talked we asked

350
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:35,049
them for three different workshops with

351
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:36,819
my team and and there their problem is

352
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:40,059
they have very good infrastructure for

353
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:41,949
cycling segregated bike lines but they

354
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:43,629
are not able to really get people on

355
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:45,819
bikes because the public transport it's

356
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:47,970
so good that people just use using

357
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:53,259
public transfer so this is the level I

358
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:54,639
would like to go it's not a bad that's

359
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:56,350
fantastic problem and I'm very happy

360
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,480
that we can learn from the best but in

361
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:07,360
terms of mobility cars sorry for that

362
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:10,540
but cars are just not not very in good

363
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,309
place right now in some cities are

364
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,829
looking at things like congestion

365
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:18,339
pricing charging you if you want to

366
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:20,258
drive around in your vehicle during busy

367
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,939
times is that something you're seeing

368
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:24,579
more cities look at your city might look

369
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:26,649
at I was actually living in London 2004

370
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:28,449
when they start it was the first city

371
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:32,290
new Europe congestion charge the time

372
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:35,738
was five pounds I think today is 1150 so

373
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:39,040
it's crazy how this regulation are how

374
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:41,709
strong are this regulation we of course

375
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,719
we are talking now on two topics in

376
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:47,378
Bratislava first one is congestion

377
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,199
charge but we prefer and we are doing it

378
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:52,540
are the just normal parking policies

379
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:54,819
regulations so everybody making parking

380
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,759
more expenses yeah American parking

381
00:16:54,819 --> 00:17:00,939
that's it that's it I died I will never

382
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,549
use this but the realities I would like

383
00:17:00,939 --> 00:17:08,379
to talk about the fair way have to use

384
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:11,619
the public space for example okay all

385
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,240
right let's give the mayor a break one

386
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:17,219
of the issues that so many cities

387
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,500
grapple with as they grow is is housing

388
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,110
give us your thoughts on how cities can

389
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,819
move forward in in that area because

390
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,678
that's that's difficult especially

391
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:30,820
cities that are already very congested

392
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:33,429
and don't have extra space yeah and I

393
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,860
very much like the idea of rather like

394
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:38,020
thinking than only say smart cities

395
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,129
because of course it's great to have

396
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,600
lots of sensors but

397
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,890
people if people don't have a decent

398
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,090
place to live and participate in society

399
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,880
and work life

400
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,770
there's no good so we do need cities to

401
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,570
plan for future growth we have the

402
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,840
stunning numbers on how many future

403
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,280
additional urban residents there will be

404
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,240
if the status quo is that already today

405
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,090
330 million urban households in the

406
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,520
world cannot afford decent places to

407
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,290
live and the gap between what they can

408
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,990
afford and what it would cost to house

409
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:14,920
them decently is 650 billion dollars a

410
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:18,430
year now for too long particularly and

411
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,770
say the Western world we have been

412
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,660
thinking about this problem as a

413
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:24,700
financial problem we've been trying to

414
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,980
throw finance at the problem and then

415
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,800
what comes out is what you see also a

416
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:32,290
London is a good example or say bad

417
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,320
example in that regard you throw a lot

418
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:37,750
of financing at the problem and at

419
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,790
people you see house prices rise

420
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:45,550
fivefold over too many years and supply

421
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:47,320
doesn't move at all there's no supply

422
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,659
response because the issue is a supply

423
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,460
issue much more than a finance or demand

424
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,310
issue and this is I think where where

425
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,200
cities need to plan forward to how to

426
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:58,919
accommodate growth that's kind of what

427
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,380
our thinking the city needs to do and

428
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,240
where to find the space for additional

429
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:07,330
housing and how to deliver productively

430
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,220
and quite often it's actually not as

431
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,379
impossible as it may seem we we didn't

432
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:13,410
analyze in in California which is as

433
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,640
everyone knows a pretty dense place

434
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:17,860
where people would say well it's also

435
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,180
difficult to find all that additional

436
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,699
housing and we all know it's a very

437
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,830
unaffordable place as well but just with

438
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,160
geospatial analysis to give it some

439
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:30,040
smartness again we found space for three

440
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,380
and a half million homes within existing

441
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,210
urban boundaries so so what our city's

442
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:39,250
missing what are they not looking at

443
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:44,680
that you saw yeah if effectively there's

444
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:48,880
a lot of unused or underused urban land

445
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:52,570
plots for all kinds of reasons there's

446
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,110
sometimes it's related to to speculation

447
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,299
and just

448
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:58,559
on the plates to wait for prices to

449
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:01,030
appreciate it sometimes because of

450
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,490
zoning or building code requirements

451
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:06,010
that made it make it too expensive to

452
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,470
redevelop and so on so there's a lot of

453
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:11,980
things that can be changed and then

454
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,080
there's the more say fundamental shifts

455
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:16,780
particularly moving towards dense

456
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,428
transit oriented development where if

457
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,110
you want to add a lot of housing to

458
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,929
cities of course you need the transport

459
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:24,309
to bring people in and out there is not

460
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:26,169
easy you cannot build massive new

461
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:30,100
highways in existing cities at least not

462
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:32,470
so it at good expenses but most cities

463
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,030
do have good transit hubs already so if

464
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,370
you increase the density around those

465
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:40,389
and increase it actually massively like

466
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,889
five to ten X rather than 1.5 X as most

467
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,070
people see this think about when this

468
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:48,690
thing densification then you find those

469
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:51,490
numbers of additional home supply

470
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,590
fascinating his puzzle on this issue

471
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,500
because I think obviously housing is

472
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,970
important where we see and as I

473
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,400
mentioned we are focusing very much on

474
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,260
market gaps where we see the need for a

475
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,809
public Development Bank to be engaged

476
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:08,530
and in terms of housing in cities we see

477
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:11,260
three particular areas one is exactly

478
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:13,240
the development of housing in the areas

479
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,100
which are difficult for the real-estate

480
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,540
development for example brownfields

481
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,120
there are many brownfields especially in

482
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,580
central Eastern Europe where in the past

483
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,428
you had industrial plants in the cities

484
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,110
themselves and they obviously have to be

485
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:27,429
dealt with from the environmental point

486
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,199
of view but on the other hand they

487
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,570
represent quite an interesting area for

488
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,919
real estate development see cleaners

489
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,049
happen develop so basically but it's

490
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:36,790
quite a risky operation obviously for

491
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:39,580
any developer because you also have to

492
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,649
take on your shoulders the environmental

493
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,360
aspects and cetera so there is a role

494
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,870
and do countries here they'll cover that

495
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,030
cost if you are developing the area I

496
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,399
mean we have several projects the most

497
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,049
recent one I remember is in Warsaw where

498
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,630
there was a brownfield basically old

499
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:59,320
industrial plant in this bicycle center

500
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:01,660
of Warsaw and the real estate developer

501
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,178
was trying to get commercial financing

502
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,550
for from the project for residential

503
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:08,530
housing and it was impossible because

504
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:10,240
there was just too much risk for

505
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,990
commercial banks in terms of the

506
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,570
environmental liability so so we had to

507
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,970
step in and take kind of fruitless peace

508
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,090
aspect and then private sector came in

509
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,370
so that's one area the other area is

510
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,770
so-called near near near zero emission

511
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,330
buildings this is very important for

512
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,850
cities especially in moving towards

513
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,280
clean cities decreasing the energy

514
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,090
consumption etc and I think this is

515
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,550
something where many cities are now

516
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:42,820
moving towards and the third area is

517
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:44,440
so-called social housing what were

518
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,060
dimension is really the fact in many

519
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,830
cities I think in Germany in their

520
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,629
demonstrations recently in Berlin and

521
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,899
other places because what you see is

522
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,130
that the cost of housing and of rent

523
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,430
Falls is going up

524
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:01,300
also things like Airbnb people are

525
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:03,880
basically renting their apartments for

526
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,470
for tourists and so on and all these

527
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,650
basically leads to the increase of the

528
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,170
cost of housing and rentals so there is

529
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,940
a big pressure and very simply supported

530
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:15,970
for example social housing development

531
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,250
in Austria in Vienna but we see more and

532
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:20,260
more of this happening actually the

533
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,300
municipalities and the local governments

534
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,070
have to take the lead in providing

535
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,379
social housing for especially for young

536
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:29,669
families all the families who cannot

537
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:33,040
afford to pay the current market prices

538
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:35,560
andreas I'd like to go back to talking

539
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,710
about transportation with you so as we

540
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:41,620
look at these thinking or smart cities

541
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:45,250
of the future etc and and as the mayor

542
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:48,159
mentioned what will be the future of the

543
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,990
vehicle are we looking at electric are

544
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,040
we looking at autonomous they just going

545
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:55,300
away as he suggested and if so if BMW is

546
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,379
working toward that last goal when

547
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,510
aren't you working ourselves out of

548
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:06,160
business so what we are doing right now

549
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:10,300
in terms of a strategy we are grouping

550
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,170
our R&D investments around what we call

551
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,070
the four aces

552
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:17,260
so that is autonomous connected

553
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,550
electrified and shared and that implies

554
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,400
what what the mobility will look like

555
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:24,980
you know it will be to a to large degree

556
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,590
or anonymous in in in cities and we are

557
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,790
talking here not a future dream i

558
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,530
anything like that but we are talking

559
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:34,520
basically you know when in the case of

560
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:38,480
BMW autonomous vehicles being available

561
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:43,100
as early as 2021 right so that is two

562
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,910
years from now I guess and electrified

563
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,129
is a is a is a no question topic anyway

564
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:52,910
you know that is no longer something

565
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:55,610
that people and cities do really think

566
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:57,050
about it is a given to a large degree

567
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,959
when it comes to their strategic

568
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,180
approaches but again you know look at at

569
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,590
the realities

570
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:06,320
how much charging infrastructure is

571
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:08,480
already available it's it's a big topic

572
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,379
it's a big topic in Germany I'm not sure

573
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,420
about what is love I have to say but

574
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,430
it's it's in many cities through Europe

575
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:18,560
and and certainly in other places in the

576
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:20,330
world it is a big topic and I can tell

577
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,899
you for example that for the time being

578
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:26,659
we fleet in into our car sharing fleet

579
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,970
we have Drive now it is called some

580
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:32,870
people will know it probably worldwide

581
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:35,800
car sharing operation we get more and

582
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:39,770
more electric vehicles into these fleets

583
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,930
and in in which and we arrange those

584
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,639
cities where we have this fleet running

585
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:46,220
that they built up the charging

586
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,290
infrastructure so it is a it is

587
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,150
basically a contract you know the more

588
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,550
electric vehicles we bring into the

589
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,140
fleet the more the cities are supporting

590
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,480
that with charging infrastructure not

591
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,480
only for our cars obviously but for for

592
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,620
all the cars often then trying to

593
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,470
utilize a public-private partnership

594
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:06,800
model in order to make that happen

595
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:09,650
and yes the future of mobility in cities

596
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:15,020
is probably not characterized in 2030 or

597
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:17,540
2040 by an endless number of spots you

598
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,580
till eternity vehicles SUVs that was

599
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,730
probably the point that you were making

600
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,409
you know that kind of an of a picture is

601
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:27,440
probably not the one that everyone

602
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:30,470
strives for also not we right we

603
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,400
understand that this is not

604
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,919
not sustainable but there's going to be

605
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,610
a place for the individual car no

606
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:46,070
question but it will be integrated in a

607
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:47,780
multi-modal traffic system that is you

608
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:50,030
know including sharing let it be bikes

609
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,980
or car sharing in general that the

610
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:53,570
obviously include public transportation

611
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,730
and so on I just give you one one

612
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,610
example from copying one of the leaders

613
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:01,630
obviously in that field where we have a

614
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:05,510
project running with Areva

615
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:09,200
we gave them they bought actually 400

616
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:11,210
BMW i3 so 400 full electric vehicles and

617
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,970
got them into a car sharing fleet and

618
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:17,960
the whole traffic system in Copenhagen

619
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:19,520
is is utilized by customers through the

620
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,679
so-called riser card which is a travel

621
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,179
card a way you can do everything you can

622
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,650
do back share and with that card you can

623
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:27,080
do back pick transportation you can do

624
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,659
car sharing you can do light rail you

625
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,668
can actually choose but you always have

626
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:34,159
the convenience of using that car to

627
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:37,429
open that world of mobility so those are

628
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,900
opens all doors yeah and that's you know

629
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:41,510
that's a data-driven approach obviously

630
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,970
you know here comes smart where those

631
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,789
thinking data that doesn't make sense

632
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,380
ultimately and it's it's not rocket

633
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:51,140
science as you can see in the case of

634
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,700
cop making it's feasible and we hope to

635
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,600
seem all that and we are going to be

636
00:27:52,700 --> 00:28:00,559
part of that no question Matus annie i

637
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,049
be a survey and 2018 found that 70% of

638
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,020
municipalities consider fiscal

639
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:07,490
constraints to be a major obstacle as

640
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,530
they try to move forward with their

641
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,900
their future visions whether it involves

642
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:17,360
major infrastructure etc how are you

643
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:18,169
financing your bratislava plan that's a

644
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,418
difficult one

645
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:25,610
it always is I mean on the political

646
00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:28,190
level of course it's very difficult to

647
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:32,350
talk about more density because people

648
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:36,070
are in Bratislava with with a very huge

649
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:41,629
developer development boom from 2000

650
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:44,270
after 2010 and so on as a very hot topic

651
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,820
but we are lucky because

652
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:49,639
we don't have big density in British

653
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:54,740
Isles so we still have a possibility to

654
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:57,280
grow in the inner city without before us

655
00:28:54,740 --> 00:29:00,230
to do to build satellite cities or

656
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,350
outskirts which are in economical and in

657
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,980
a sociological way very bad solution for

658
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:09,199
for the city so imagine again I know

659
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,300
it's Vienna but if we are making

660
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,430
comparison with Vienna the size of the

661
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,550
two cities are nearly similar but in

662
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,860
Vienna they have two millions and we are

663
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:21,620
600,000 so so we still have a lot of

664
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:24,889
space which is important and Bratislava

665
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:28,090
owns still some of the space in own City

666
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:30,830
which is important as well of course and

667
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,919
we what we are looking now with my new

668
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:36,830
team is to have a smaller depth with 50

669
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,110
our depth like cities for 50% which is

670
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:43,189
we don't want to have have it more and

671
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:46,120
if we will be able to make it smaller we

672
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:49,700
definitely go with some smart financing

673
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,280
and you raise taxes to get to achieve

674
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,900
some of your goals or no that's that's

675
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,520
very tough one

676
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,560
of course we starting with parking

677
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,920
policies the parking regulation and we

678
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:05,000
we hope we will have we have some money

679
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:09,590
from it every year we need to see how it

680
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,100
goes and we have we have possibility to

681
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:14,510
to raise local taxes some local taxes

682
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,600
it's a possibility they are very small

683
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:20,690
in European level they're very small and

684
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,030
if I will be forced to do that because

685
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:26,480
of better development of City I will do

686
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,910
that and maybe just just as an addition

687
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,580
also we see clearly that ultimately a

688
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:34,280
smart sorry for using that term again a

689
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:37,760
smart way to do pricing also for

690
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,190
mobility for example is going to be also

691
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,500
a given it is totally needed and you

692
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,720
know there might be some revenues out of

693
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:48,020
that but even more important is the

694
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,700
signal to organize the city in order to

695
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,379
to make sure that the sustainability

696
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:55,710
goals and the development goals are

697
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:59,159
achieved so we will see very soon

698
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:03,840
and much more road pricing much more

699
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:05,880
City pricing excess pricing and we need

700
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,520
to do that in a way so that makes

701
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,500
ecologically sense and also delivers

702
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,690
what is needed and that there is a good

703
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:16,039
mobility performance because mobility oh

704
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:18,779
absolutely relates also to the economic

705
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:21,620
activities of the city it is a total

706
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:23,610
necessary t-too to have a good mobility

707
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:27,510
infrastructure in cities but it's

708
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:30,389
changing right now tripping on the

709
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:33,419
financing a question I think one one

710
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:36,029
tool that in my sense is under deployed

711
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:39,630
for financing city grows and smartness

712
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:43,080
and improvement this forms of land value

713
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,250
capture and I mean you may agree or

714
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,080
disagree I have no idea what the

715
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,690
situation and Vladislav is but the the

716
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,668
situation is that cities invest in

717
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:54,120
better infrastructure and better quality

718
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:56,450
of life outcomes and better amenities

719
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,760
for cities security all those things

720
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:02,370
that make the city and of course all the

721
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,149
real estate in the city much more

722
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:08,129
valuable and in most situations that

723
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:10,739
means someone who is sitting on a plot

724
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:13,049
of land for of urban and just waits

725
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,450
waits waits waits for the actor the city

726
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:18,179
to do its drop and then reaps a huge

727
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:20,669
profit when he sells or develops that

728
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,970
profit and my sense of a market economy

729
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:27,990
belongs to the city and good share and

730
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:33,090
that is big value and a big lever for

731
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:37,710
financing talk about financing I have to

732
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:40,289
say something now obviously what matters

733
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,730
mention mention is a big issue not only

734
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:43,379
in Slovakia but throughout the region

735
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,380
because you have this so-called debt

736
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:49,649
caps for on the municipal and regional

737
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:51,149
levels so the mayor's or heads of

738
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:53,789
municipalities and regions they have to

739
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:56,209
be very careful how much they invest how

740
00:32:53,789 --> 00:33:00,690
much money they spent so that they don't

741
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:03,740
breach this debt cap that level and also

742
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:05,690
I think is something which is very

743
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,670
closely monitored by the citizens by the

744
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,610
opposition and so on so the question is

745
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:13,160
how do you finance especially larger

746
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:16,879
projects in this kind of constrained

747
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,610
situation one possibility is to look for

748
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,310
different so-called off-balance-sheet

749
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:23,870
operations where the financing is not

750
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:26,540
aggregated into the internal budget of

751
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,610
the municipality or the region we are

752
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,260
quite often working as the bank for

753
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,439
example with the different municipal

754
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,360
companies and transport company waste

755
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,520
management company etc which in many

756
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,370
cases is of balance sheet so basically

757
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:44,060
the financing does not go into the debt

758
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:46,550
structure of the municipality or there

759
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:49,159
are interesting structures for example

760
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:52,460
for the energy efficiency so-called

761
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:55,940
energy performance contracting where a

762
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:57,860
private provider of energy efficiency

763
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,540
when you improve the energy efficiency

764
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,669
especially in public buildings because

765
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:05,210
municipality cities they have many

766
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:07,610
schools hospitals local different

767
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:12,139
offices etc which consume a lot of

768
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:14,810
energy and you by decreasing the energy

769
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:18,049
consumption by improving the quality of

770
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,850
the buildings you save when a lot of

771
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,010
energy and also of course improve the

772
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,380
environment and so on so if you have a

773
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:27,080
private company which does it for the

774
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:30,530
municipality and invest into this and

775
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:33,650
then the companies paid by the savings

776
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:36,590
on the energy then basically this

777
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,870
operation is also not aggregated into

778
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:41,240
the internet so there are structures of

779
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:44,330
this type which can be I think in a

780
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:46,699
creative way utilized by by mayor's by

781
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,860
municipalities to to deal with the issue

782
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:51,199
of the limitations of the all the dead

783
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,060
break fascinating no we're gonna be

784
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,739
going to questions shortly and you can

785
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,299
either ask them in person I think we

786
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,939
have someone who will have a microphone

787
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,040
already to come to and you can also

788
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,050
submit them on slide oh and then they'll

789
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,180
pop up on the screen and I'll share them

790
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,640
with the audience with my panel and with

791
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,859
all of you I'd like to go to the mayor

792
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,990
for one final question mr. mayor I've

793
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,680
heard you talk about Vienna a little bit

794
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,328
of

795
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,868
and some of the things they have that

796
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:20,630
you might want to emulate II is that the

797
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:22,069
the city that that is the model that

798
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,529
you'd like to followers there another

799
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:25,849
one somewhere else in the globe that you

800
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:29,329
someday you know Bratislava wants to be

801
00:35:25,849 --> 00:35:33,920
the fill in the blank of Slovakia what

802
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:36,520
is what is your ideal city I spent a lot

803
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,410
of times on different conferences I

804
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:43,720
spend a lot of time difficult organized

805
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:48,920
by Bloomberg or or Atlanta even oh and

806
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:51,740
and there are so many good examples in

807
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,200
the world and what is very good at Lima

808
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,328
feudin I mean I guess there was New York

809
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:00,740
it was a big inspiration of course

810
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:03,440
different scale different frame low

811
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,720
frame or legislative frame but there are

812
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,640
so many bright ideas of court coming

813
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,069
from there and I was glad that I

814
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,180
interview for Slovak magazine Janet said

815
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:17,750
he can for example she was a she was a

816
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:20,509
director of transportation director so

817
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,609
she was a director of Department of

818
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,460
Transportation of city of New York under

819
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:27,529
the Bloomberg and and what is good on

820
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:30,559
these different meetings of the mayors

821
00:36:27,529 --> 00:36:33,130
that every every mayor is always happy

822
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,089
to share success you know if they are

823
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:38,210
successful in something they always

824
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:42,828
share so the ideas are are pretty much

825
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:45,349
always on the table and I always use

826
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:48,109
this expression that in art you you

827
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:51,339
cannot use copying you cannot do that

828
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:54,680
because but in doing the cities we we we

829
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:56,630
inspiration and sometimes also copying

830
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,058
some stuff is very very good it's it's

831
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:02,000
very necessary to do that and mainly in

832
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:05,799
any situation where Bratislava is now we

833
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,630
I feel bad so is quite a lot behind

834
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:11,599
other cities on European levels for

835
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:16,130
example also there are so many issues

836
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,859
for example we we didn't have open data

837
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:22,160
we didn't work with open data our data

838
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:24,620
which are every day we aggregating

839
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,859
thousands of data as a variant

840
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:30,620
they are not available for public there

841
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:33,080
so did this just start we can talk about

842
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:37,310
how many flats bratislava owns rights la

843
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:40,330
owns 945 flights which is absolutely

844
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:42,620
tragic tragic fact so we don't have

845
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:45,799
housing we don't have we don't have this

846
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:48,170
important instrument which is so so

847
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,910
important so this is one of my biggest

848
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:53,240
challenges to build new houses new

849
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:55,819
houses so there are so so many we can

850
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:57,859
talk about security we can talk about

851
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,890
the using of technologies for example

852
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:05,180
yeah also using technology for security

853
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:08,359
in the street and so I just as I said I

854
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:10,009
know this Vienna is on very different

855
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,080
levels at the top of the world but I

856
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:14,870
always like to learn from the best and

857
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,080
we are the actual Vienna Bratislava is

858
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:19,130
two closest capital cities in world or I

859
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,400
think so

860
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:24,590
so and we have a good relationship so

861
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,820
this is the where I want to go you have

862
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,160
New York but you have Brno

863
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:31,070
which is the second biggest city of

864
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,589
Czech Republic and they agreed they made

865
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:36,500
you in the last four years great work

866
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:39,200
with homelessness there was a working

867
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,880
the program called housing first where

868
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,680
you you finishing you stopping

869
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:49,760
homelessness giving the houses to the

870
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,310
homeless people not not not work now but

871
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,830
housing that there's always the team so

872
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:57,650
a lot of inspiration and and I'm always

873
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:59,150
continuing to see what's happening

874
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,580
outside of Slovakia and different cities

875
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:05,710
thank you well let's go to questions and

876
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,710
if you would identify yourself please

877
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,700
good morning thank you my name is Peter

878
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,350
Schneider I'm from the Slovak foreign

879
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,419
ministry where I am coordinator for

880
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:16,970
migration so that indicates where my

881
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,680
question is going to you've been talking

882
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:22,910
about challenges such as housing

883
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:25,100
mobility economic activity but only mr.

884
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,710
Hudak so far mentioned migration briefly

885
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,080
we know that big city is a large cities

886
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,880
are to a large extent formed also by

887
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,860
migrants the Bratislava is full of

888
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,510
migrants from all the corners of

889
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,100
Slovakia including myself but don't

890
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:38,060
worry mr. wallow I'm paying my taxes

891
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:43,220
here ammaji

892
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:45,380
the resident but the economic activity

893
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,899
and the possibilities of the cities are

894
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,790
of course attracting migrants when I say

895
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,560
migrants or migration I have in mind a

896
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:54,230
regular migration of the workforce

897
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,570
mainly how do you see and also taking

898
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:58,130
into account the name of this panel

899
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:00,200
cities driving for change how do you see

900
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,230
the role of the cities of the

901
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,839
municipalities in influencing the

902
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,970
national policies on migration regulated

903
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,950
migration of the workforce because there

904
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,959
are examples including Munich that

905
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,339
cities can actually achieve a lot and

906
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,560
they can make a change when the

907
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,960
politicians on national level are

908
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:25,460
failing or not delivering on the

909
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:29,540
migration thank you thank you I'll try

910
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:31,880
and certainly a big issue especially in

911
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:33,950
Slovakia for example where as we know

912
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,720
the regional differences are very very

913
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:40,399
high and many people migrate from the

914
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,980
less developed parts of Slovakia to

915
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,220
obviously Bratislava or the parts of the

916
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,290
country which are more developed and it

917
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,910
creates obviously a challenge for the

918
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:52,160
country itself how to deal with the

919
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,890
regional differences and secondly

920
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,940
obviously for the recipient

921
00:40:53,890 --> 00:41:01,100
municipalities or regions how to deal

922
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:03,170
with this new group of people one thing

923
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,700
which we are addressing is as a bank

924
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:07,160
because one of the issues obviously for

925
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:09,740
this so-called migrants or new new

926
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,620
people in the community is the issue of

927
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,359
housing and and rental housing

928
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,190
availability of rental housing is

929
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,380
something which is very important it's

930
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,210
also very important for the labor force

931
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:23,390
mobility within within the country

932
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:25,460
itself so we have joint programs with

933
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,290
with different municipalities throughout

934
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,410
Europe European Union where we actually

935
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:31,790
support construction development of

936
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,060
rental housing which is in many cases

937
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:38,150
used is especially to target the the

938
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,500
commuting or the migrant population of

939
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,330
course then you have a different type of

940
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,360
migrants who are migrants from outside

941
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:47,769
of the country the issue is probably a

942
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:50,900
little more complex and challenging

943
00:41:47,769 --> 00:41:54,348
obviously in our policies as the bank

944
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:56,390
being a public development bank we make

945
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:59,779
sure that any solutions we provide do

946
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:03,499
not lead to any ghettoization creating

947
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:06,289
ghettos for some groups of population

948
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:08,209
and and here I think cities can be very

949
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:10,339
very important drivers also for the

950
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:13,640
national policy because we do have you

951
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:15,140
know many discussions also in the v4

952
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,328
countries and our region how to deal

953
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:20,150
with migration migration not internal

954
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:22,609
but external and I think cities can

955
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,259
provide a good example how how such

956
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:26,569
migration actually can benefit the

957
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:28,400
countries and have can contribute in a

958
00:42:26,569 --> 00:42:30,499
positive way to the to the international

959
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,059
economy thank you for so we have a

960
00:42:30,499 --> 00:42:35,269
question here on slide oh and I'll go to

961
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:38,269
that of the question or Alexander asks

962
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:41,269
after decades of continued urbanization

963
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:43,519
is there any hope left for rural areas

964
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:46,788
what are the political consequences of

965
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:53,779
cities moving faster than the rest would

966
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:56,119
like to take that one Matus if you are

967
00:42:53,779 --> 00:43:00,949
talking about the rural areas around the

968
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:03,289
Bratislava for example it's it's a big

969
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:07,989
challenge because we of course practices

970
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:12,499
growing very fast we have there is

971
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:15,949
Slovaks like to own own housing the Dell

972
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:19,339
like to be owners of place where they

973
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:22,579
are living and and what's happening that

974
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:24,828
that there is these satellites villages

975
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:26,989
or cities are built around the brightest

976
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:29,269
law but without good infrastructure

977
00:43:26,989 --> 00:43:31,789
without good public transportation of

978
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:34,299
course so so it it means more cars

979
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:37,900
coming every day is to Bratislava and

980
00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:40,940
and actually the consumer consumption

981
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,400
confirmation of the of the land is it's

982
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,289
just too big and which is losing this

983
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,029
kind of countryside and branches

984
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:51,499
becoming just one big urban sprawl so

985
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:54,729
against the density is the key word in

986
00:43:51,499 --> 00:43:58,549
this in this case and we will try to

987
00:43:54,729 --> 00:44:00,468
explain to citizen that the dense city

988
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:01,220
can be also good city doesn't really

989
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:04,190
mean that

990
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:06,379
they they will not have a green space or

991
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:09,800
they will no have a public space and and

992
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:12,230
use this land anyone else wanna chime in

993
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,369
yep let's see do we have any other

994
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:18,290
questions from the room let's go back to

995
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:21,470
any other ideas I can continue with

996
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:25,759
slide oh let's see well I think I

997
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:29,509
already sort of asked the example of the

998
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,060
second question regarding examples hmm

999
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:35,060
interesting

1000
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:38,990
anonymous asks who benefits from smart

1001
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:41,119
cities the most is there one segment of

1002
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:49,490
the population that benefits more than

1003
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:51,589
another thought I believe that

1004
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:55,729
eventually the citizens benefit among

1005
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:57,319
the citizens of the city or at the end

1006
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:58,790
of the day it should be it should be for

1007
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,250
the citizens and improving the

1008
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:02,960
environment improving the the way how

1009
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:04,670
the city functions whether it's about

1010
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,040
transport about energy about waste

1011
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:11,990
management but I think what I agree I

1012
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,630
think that issue of smart cities and

1013
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:17,569
calling everything smart is probably too

1014
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:20,359
much and we like to use it because it

1015
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:23,000
brings something a flavour of new and

1016
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:28,670
being modern but for us what is

1017
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:30,920
important is that value that for us

1018
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:33,109
smart means that there is a strategic

1019
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:35,780
thinking in the city itself you know

1020
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:38,750
that we don't do ad hoc decisions and

1021
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:41,710
solutions quick fixes just because it

1022
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:44,810
has to be done but there is a strategy a

1023
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,700
way how the leadership of the city by

1024
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:48,589
also engaging citizens and this is very

1025
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,140
important this goes in and shweet who

1026
00:45:48,589 --> 00:45:53,750
benefits because some time I think there

1027
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:56,180
is a view and feeling that actually who

1028
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:58,490
benefits are those IT companies and the

1029
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,399
providers of different solutions maybe

1030
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,709
some car companies who provide the car

1031
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,569
sharing pooling and so on but I think

1032
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,250
it's very important that behind the

1033
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:09,680
strategy long term strategy there is

1034
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:12,660
also engagement of people and for SAP I

1035
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,990
always like one example from Krakow

1036
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,740
is a city in in Poland beautiful city

1037
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:21,569
and what they do to promote innovation

1038
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:23,339
internally in in the city itself they

1039
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,080
organize I don't know every year of

1040
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,570
every second year but they organize a

1041
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:30,480
competition for the most innovative

1042
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,310
ideas for the city and it's targeting

1043
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,760
especially younger people yeah basically

1044
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:38,100
up to 35 and then they select the best

1045
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,110
ideas and those best ideas which

1046
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:43,230
actually voted by the population my

1047
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:45,450
website a portal then those ideas the

1048
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:48,150
top three also have to be implemented by

1049
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:50,730
the leadership of the city so I think

1050
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,920
innovation smartness is also about

1051
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:54,960
communicating with people getting them

1052
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,560
energized getting the ideas from them

1053
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,410
implementing those ideas in in such way

1054
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,970
and obviously engaging private sector I

1055
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,970
think it's very important private sector

1056
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:07,740
has to be a part in this process and and

1057
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:11,100
it has to be part of the overall

1058
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:13,589
strategy for the city itself yon how do

1059
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,900
cities make sure they move forward into

1060
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:23,070
the future that they don't leave one

1061
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:26,450
segment of the population behind they're

1062
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:30,690
developing these thinking smart cities

1063
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:33,450
yeah I think the the more narrow scope

1064
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,130
of smartness there is this is to an

1065
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,629
extent probably than even either easier

1066
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:39,300
to achieve because you have such a

1067
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,430
magnitude of dozens and dozens of

1068
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,380
different applications and use cases and

1069
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,690
one benefits one segment more one

1070
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:50,460
benefits another segment more thing in

1071
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:52,170
the end everyone when benefits the the

1072
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,550
bigger challenge are saying are they are

1073
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:58,320
the big topics of urban development

1074
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:59,970
integration with the more rural areas

1075
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:03,710
around providing housing providing

1076
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:08,490
infrastructure providing public services

1077
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:11,640
at quality and I think we could we can

1078
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:13,020
open up a huge discussion around all of

1079
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,310
this but and in the end it's actually

1080
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:19,710
it's mostly about good planning and and

1081
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,810
of course also having the financing

1082
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:23,850
behind the plans and I can offer allow

1083
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:25,960
me that that one other comment on on the

1084
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:28,328
financing and in that regard I

1085
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:30,069
I'm really kind of applauding a lot of

1086
00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:31,869
those efforts on on finding ways to

1087
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:34,210
off-balanced read and so on find all

1088
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:36,670
kinds of financing cities cities it

1089
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:40,349
still escapes me why that is actually

1090
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:43,240
necessary why do not public cities

1091
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:45,280
governments national governments have

1092
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,290
balance sheets like every corporation on

1093
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,819
this planet where assets are on the

1094
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,400
balance sheet and if you have added a

1095
00:48:48,819 --> 00:48:55,930
liability next to it it's a wash it's

1096
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:58,300
fine you can do it interesting I'm gonna

1097
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:01,980
go to one more question here from slide

1098
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:06,369
Oh from anonymous what role are upcoming

1099
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:08,530
demographic trends in other words aging

1100
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:10,240
generation on one side the ability to

1101
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:13,480
work from anywhere on the other side

1102
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,950
what role are those changing trends

1103
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,490
these upcoming trends playing in the

1104
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:20,710
strategies of smart cities and I know

1105
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:24,279
Matus that in writing Slava you have an

1106
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:26,109
issue with the population aging and will

1107
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,540
soon be become one of the oldest in

1108
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:32,109
Europe correct correct

1109
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:34,660
of course aging is a big topic around

1110
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:40,960
the Europe and European cities for many

1111
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:42,279
years and again it's it's let's talk we

1112
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,559
can talk about the on two levels

1113
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:48,700
the first one is policy level so how are

1114
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:51,730
we going to to make make are we going to

1115
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:54,669
spend our money for what what what a

1116
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:57,400
group of citizen in which many we are

1117
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:01,690
going to use money and who needs help

1118
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:05,020
and who needs our support and also in

1119
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:09,910
Bratislava planned the aging and seniors

1120
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:12,549
were big big big topic and and and after

1121
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:15,368
you have a very very another level very

1122
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:18,250
simple level and you can you can and you

1123
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:22,510
can easily do it you can very easily

1124
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:25,440
talk about what how to make a better day

1125
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:28,180
for our more senior for all this

1126
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,740
Bratislava has different cultural

1127
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,109
programs for example during the day

1128
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,910
which can be used we are now we're going

1129
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:36,730
to make we're going to do a competition

1130
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,730
for our own bench so we're going to own

1131
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:41,130
design for a new purchase

1132
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:43,470
Benj and the talk is that we are going

1133
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:46,440
to of course do the size we're seating

1134
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:48,930
is on on high of 45 centimeters but also

1135
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,720
the seating is high on 65 centimeters

1136
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:54,390
which is maybe looks strange but it's

1137
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:58,470
much easier for seniors to step from it

1138
00:50:54,390 --> 00:51:00,509
of - so these are different levels and I

1139
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:02,549
would like to embrace both levels

1140
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:04,980
the high level of the policies but of

1141
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:08,790
also the very simple changes in public

1142
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:14,460
space on this topic because I think it's

1143
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:17,580
very interesting aging is mostly viewed

1144
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:19,560
as a dangerous threat yes because

1145
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:23,240
obviously you have less population which

1146
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:26,820
is interactive age which can produce

1147
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:29,189
economic products etc but on the other

1148
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:31,340
hand one of the fastest-growing parts of

1149
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:34,740
global economy so-called gray economy

1150
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:38,790
you have huge new segments of economy

1151
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:40,379
which have to cater cater to the to the

1152
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:42,840
aging population because most of these

1153
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:46,590
people are and they live longer they

1154
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:50,250
want to be active post 60 and you have

1155
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:53,550
huge segments of services stories new

1156
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:56,070
things which can be cently health care

1157
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:58,980
which can be developed for this segment

1158
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:00,840
of population so it is an opportunity

1159
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:03,510
it's an opportunity opportunity also for

1160
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:05,790
cities to actually utilize this new

1161
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:08,910
trend phenomenon as a way to be those

1162
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:11,369
hubs of innovation and generation of the

1163
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:13,799
new economic developments and new

1164
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:15,750
economic services address I'd like to

1165
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:19,880
give you the last word before we wrap

1166
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:22,859
sit very kind as I'm reaching now 50 I

1167
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,380
like the idea of aging not being a

1168
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:28,590
problem but actually an opportunity I

1169
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:32,640
speak for many in the room I guess but

1170
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:34,260
now I just wanted to add that in in

1171
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:37,650
terms of mobility just to give you one

1172
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:43,470
example autonomous driving and and aging

1173
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:46,700
is again also an indication of how we

1174
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:49,810
regenerate actually social participation

1175
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:52,779
through technology right so

1176
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:54,310
in the very near future you can take

1177
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:58,150
that as a potential you can take it as a

1178
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,740
threat as well older people will be much

1179
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:01,480
more mobile just for the simple fact

1180
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,279
that they don't need to drive themselves

1181
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,920
but they are basically you know

1182
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,350
passenger in an autonomous car or

1183
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,630
vehicle let's put it the more general

1184
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:13,750
and and with that they have the

1185
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:15,490
capabilities to do more than they used

1186
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:17,230
to and you know when you come from an

1187
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:20,799
humanistic point of view that is

1188
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:22,420
certainly the big advantage it has to be

1189
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,670
dealt with because it potentially means

1190
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:28,480
also more vehicle miles traveled in

1191
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:31,600
cities so more more traffic but there

1192
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:36,040
again innovation and technology used in

1193
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:38,319
a smart way and can provide here the

1194
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:43,960
ability to combine the social factor and

1195
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:46,060
the intelligence but please join me in

1196
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,490
thanking this wonderful panel I'm
