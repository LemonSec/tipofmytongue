2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:08,099
business interests are much more

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,840
committed to being global than national

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,219
political interest sometimes by the way

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,160
I don't think the two are mutually

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,049
exclusive making money and doing the

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,550
right thing for the society I actually

8
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,560
think the smart companies that mean

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,560
exactly that when we're facing an

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,890
existential threat from climate

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,590
disruptions how do you make this into an

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,029
opportunity if we don't stop the climate

13
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,430
change they're going to keep moving

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,260
that's a natural human reaction for

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,090
survival there's a whole bunch of new

16
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,589
leaders coming in right now so I hope

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,870
that the best people will take the

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,610
positions of responsibility and that

19
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,899
there will be willingness to work

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,149
together to take that responsibility

21
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,640
when the state is not there you have

22
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,379
someone willing to push aside the state

23
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,930
and replace it if we're going to be

24
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,718
effective in this much more complicated

25
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,340
world that we face we need all the

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,160
allies and partners we can find

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,930
particularly in other regions

28
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,929
