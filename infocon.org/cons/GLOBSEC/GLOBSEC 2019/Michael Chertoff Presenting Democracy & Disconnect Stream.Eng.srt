1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,060
we're facing a crisis in democracy and

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,099
in faith in governing institutions we

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,139
have social divisions some of them are

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:12,269
economic and some of it is identity

5
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,799
politics we need to do more to make sure

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,470
that people from different sectors of

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,448
society see what they have in common

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,229
consider how we make sure everybody is

9
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:24,150
included when economic prosperity

10
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:26,880
advances we need to secure election in

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,150
infrastructure make sure that efforts to

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,479
discourage voting by sending out false

13
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,739
media messages on social media are

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,110
counteracted we need to understand

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,089
better how we again give central

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,420
Europeans a sense of being included in

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:45,390
the Liberal Democratic Enterprise Europe

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,950
and North America are dedicated to rule

19
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,289
of law freedom democracy and

20
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:55,020
humanitarian obligations it's up to all

21
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,660
members of society to go out of their

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,180
way to make sure they reinforce the very

23
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,179
strong common fundamental bonds we share
