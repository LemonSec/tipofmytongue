00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,930

63
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,200
you all I wanted to start with a very

64
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,510
simple question and one that you may

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,549
have received once or twice before but

66
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,060
before we start talking about how we

67
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:03,460
deal with Russia let's talk about what

68
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,500
Russia wants and just let me throw that

69
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,480
out if it's a short answer that's fine

70
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,080
but Brian let me start with you what do

71
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,090
you think Russia wants yeah thanks um I

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,670
mean I think what Russia wants is clear

73
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,270
and it's also clear that Russia wants

74
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,559
things we can't give to it Russia wants

75
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,660
its neighbours sovereignty to be

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,370
conditional Russia has a problem with

77
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,750
Georgia's sovereignty it's a problem

78
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,640
with Latvia sovereignty has a problem

79
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,710
with the stoniest sovereignty and to say

80
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,600
the needless to mention it has a problem

81
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,540
with Ukraine's sovereignty that's that's

82
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,980
something Russia wants and when I think

83
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,179
we have to ask ourselves are we prepared

84
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:43,989
to give that I'm not Russia wants to

85
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,850
expand the kind of a corrupt

86
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,280
kleptocratic system that exists inside

87
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,750
of Russia what the emigrate political

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,720
scientist Elena Lydon you have a call

89
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,130
sistema it wants to spread this into the

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,140
former Soviet Union into the former

91
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:59,019
Warsaw Pact and farther two points

92
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,940
farther west if we're okay with that we

93
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,590
can have a discussion with mr. Putin if

94
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,470
we're not okay with that we really can't

95
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,390
have a discussion about this the Russia

96
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,100
wants to destroy NATO it has a problem

97
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,339
with NATO and it wants it wants NATO to

98
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,810
be dissolved and destroyed and Russia

99
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,000
wants to destroy the European Union

100
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,709
Russia wants the end to a rules-based

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,870
international system based on

102
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,980
institutions and wants one based on

103
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,900
great power politics and/or

104
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,120
or might makes right so I think this is

105
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,590
what Russia wants this is clear I mean I

106
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,080
think this has been clear for some time

107
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,489
and I think we have to stop asking what

108
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,919
Russia wants and start thinking about

109
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,540
what we want so I think that's how I

110
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,600
would I would kind of reframe the

111
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,970
question that way so do you see it that

112
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,010
way

113
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:45,160
thank you very much I think reframing

114
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:47,110
the question is exactly what I also

115
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,900
thought would be the right point because

116
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,460
I think everybody understands recognizes

117
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,039
what Russia wants and Georgia is a

118
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,890
perfect example of that alongside with

119
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,170
Ukraine infringement of sovereignty and

120
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:02,710
territorial integrity which goes on for

121
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:04,600
decades and we find ourselves exactly in

122
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,969
the same situation now in the 21st

123
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:12,700
century we're raised the why offences

124
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,560
through razor wire fences European

125
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,590
countries are being divided that is what

126
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,800
we see I think the the question that

127
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,900
will be will be posed later on how this

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,530
should be dealt with that is more

129
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:30,219
relevant for us for countries like

130
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:32,919
Georgia to think how to move forward I

131
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,900
think that that's that's the principal

132
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,940
question okay

133
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,239
Minister I can't imagine another country

134
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:43,990
that has more stake in this than Latvia

135
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,370
does how do you view from your position

136
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,080
from where you said as Minister of

137
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,640
Foreign Affairs when you look across

138
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,320
that border what do you think they want

139
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,570
from you well I think that it is going

140
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,520
to be a very boring panel because we are

141
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,780
going to agree on everything is

142
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,210
everything on everything and no kind of

143
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,070
discussion so I'm quite sorry for those

144
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,120
people who are here expecting some kind

145
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:12,400
of entertainment but at least from my

146
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,830
perspective I would say first Russia

147
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,039
really wants to restore its status of

148
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,550
great superpower in order to do that it

149
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:24,240
needs Ukraine it needs to some of those

150
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,040
countries that is in the neighborhood

151
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,740
from my perspective from latias

152
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,010
perspective I would say that we are not

153
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:37,090
any more so concerned about what's a

154
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:39,310
direct kind of possible influence on

155
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,919
material because we are part of NATO

156
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:44,860
part of EU and we jumped the Train

157
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,859
almost at the last moment of historic

158
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,410
opportunity so no military threats

159
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,510
thanks also to our allies but what we

160
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:56,770
see and there is increasing

161
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:59,530
attempt to influence societies from

162
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:03,840
Estonia to Latvia to Germany to Spain to

163
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:07,510
Italy to destroy the core of society

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,700
democratic system rule of law and to

165
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,460
some extent also to spread the new type

166
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,650
of ideology it's not anymore communism

167
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,510
now it's a kind of social conservative

168
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,250
approach they are talking about

169
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,490
traditional values but they are also

170
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:24,340
trying to affect the way how the system

171
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:28,060
works through money through corruption

172
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:30,580
through what we call also propaganda

173
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,130
warfare information warfare so those are

174
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:36,580
three things to restore the greatness as

175
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,890
they perceive it - let's say influence

176
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,039
the neighbors but also I agree with my

177
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,370
previous colleagues who spoke here also

178
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,790
to undermine institutions that we are

179
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,060
part of NATO EU and also the core system

180
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,500
of our own liberal democracies

181
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,300
let me go to you but let me slightly

182
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,100
change the question a little bit because

183
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,750
I'm sure you probably agree with our

184
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:04,060
other panelists unless you don't

185
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:07,570
in which case jump in but you've got a

186
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,700
unique perspective only not because of

187
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,159
all the work and service that you've

188
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,729
given to the Georgia situation in the

189
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,650
South Caucasus but also because you

190
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,840
served for a long time in Estonia so and

191
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,200
in a way you've served on both fronts if

192
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,560
I could put it that way are we doing

193
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:31,030
today a better job of figuring this out

194
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,039
than we were five years ago well I think

195
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,559
first of all I would agree with the with

196
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:41,978
the Minister that this there's not a lot

197
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:44,049
of daylight between us here but but I

198
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:46,690
would I would actually like to refer

199
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:48,310
back to I was sitting in in Baku one on

200
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:52,210
Monday evening with a friend in a

201
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:55,180
restaurant and and we were talking about

202
00:08:52,210 --> 00:09:00,460
that this topic more or less as well and

203
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:05,649
basically thinking that well if if

204
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:09,129
Russia if Russia wants to restore its

205
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:14,579
power and influence actually what it's

206
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:18,339
doing is is not really very sensible

207
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:20,199
because I have also my my previous job I

208
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:21,970
was dealing with Central Asia that

209
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:25,449
actually there is such a thing as this

210
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:31,199
ruski Mir and you from bishkek to Minsk

211
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:35,349
there is a common cultural sort of

212
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:38,949
emotional space which the Russians could

213
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,410
make use of as huge amounts of potential

214
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:44,160
soft power which they're not making use

215
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:47,800
of instead all of these countries are

216
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,769
around Russia are wary of Russia and so

217
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,309
the the the what what Russia is making

218
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:56,910
use of is making use of its hard power

219
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:59,019
whereas with much less effort with much

220
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:03,069
everybody feeling much more comfortable

221
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:05,829
about it it could achieve perhaps even

222
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:08,410
much more in terms of influence by by

223
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:10,349
building on this soft power and having

224
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,300
the countries around it feel actually

225
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:16,509
comfortable with with this big beer

226
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,699
sitting in Moscow and that's that's

227
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:25,120
that's really a problem that how can we

228
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:28,839
how is there a way for us to to get the

229
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,149
Russians to change track and Jim let me

230
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,889
finish off this round with you and again

231
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:35,740
you've got a very unique perspective on

232
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:38,439
the Russian situation considering your

233
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,209
background you know it used to be that

234
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:42,219
when you thought of that struggle

235
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:45,008
between the United States and the Soviet

236
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,490
Union and then with Russia that it was

237
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,749
really one of arms now particularly in

238
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,649
the United States and other countries

239
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:54,339
too I might add

240
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:57,100
it is more of an insidious attack than

241
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,529
anything else when you take a look at

242
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:06,009
that relationship particularly between

243
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:08,139
the United States and Russia I and put

244
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:10,619
it in a five-year context is getting

245
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:13,749
worse than it was five years ago

246
00:11:10,619 --> 00:11:15,370
well yes I think it is but let me start

247
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:17,920
off though and say that we've been

248
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,300
talking about what does Russia want and

249
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,760
I think it's really

250
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,530
in a lot of ways what does Putin want so

251
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,150
much of this is being driven by his own

252
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,760
personality I think one of the

253
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,949
differences with the Soviet Union and

254
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,630
the Cold War that struggle as we know

255
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,540
had a lot much more of an ideological

256
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,370
tent to it and a ideological system in

257
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,650
Moscow that kind of ran it and we went

258
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:41,530
through a lot of definite personalities

259
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,910
running the Soviet Union but today it's

260
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,660
different in the sense that we're

261
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,610
dealing with Putin and and and his own

262
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,100
views on what he wants and number one

263
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,890
what he wants us to stay in power and so

264
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,360
he's doing whatever it takes to pump

265
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,310
himself up among the Russian people

266
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,080
whether it's taking off his shirt and

267
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,530
riding bareback on a horse or its

268
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:05,380
invading Georgia and and Ukraine he's

269
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,420
he's got this tough-guy image and that's

270
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,189
part of what he's trying to do to make

271
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,020
sure he stays in power and that his

272
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,740
influence and his money and this type of

273
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,060
thing stays there to the oleg Arkell

274
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,010
system that he has set up there's a lot

275
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,560
there for him that he wants and that's

276
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,990
number one number two is I do feel he

277
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,839
has this sense almost like Adolf Hitler

278
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:29,080
had a sense within himself on what his

279
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,260
mission was his mission is to restore

280
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,880
Russia to what it was not necessarily

281
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,520
even the Soviet Union but a Russian

282
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,890
greatness whatever he has in his mind of

283
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,770
what Russian greatness looks like he

284
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,980
wants to restore that and and that

285
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,810
manifests itself in many different ways

286
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,610
but one of the tools that he likes to

287
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,199
use to bring about this Russian

288
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,930
greatness or an image of Russian

289
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,800
greatness or Putin's greatness is chaos

290
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,060
he loves chaos and he does that through

291
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,319
means whether it's interfering and

292
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,329
democracy whether it's intimidating

293
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,200
nations whether it's invading nations

294
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:07,720
whether it is it is with them on a

295
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,990
friendly way whether it's with Trump or

296
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,670
whether it's with with some political

297
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,980
parties in Europe that have an affinity

298
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:17,140
for him whether it's Syria whether it's

299
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,050
Venezuela if he can see if he can

300
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,090
instill chaos in this Western system

301
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,180
that we've created that helps him stay

302
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,730
in power and so for me as I look at that

303
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,260
question and again and and as well as

304
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,610
well as this way of warfare that you're

305
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,930
talking about to which is much more

306
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,730
insidious that is another tool

307
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,339
but he is used that is much more

308
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:40,129
effective than something kinetic you

309
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:42,649
know his misinformation campaign just in

310
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:44,629
the u.s. presidential campaign that we

311
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:47,329
just went through a few years ago that

312
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:51,350
is worth much more than five batteries

313
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:52,998
of of howitzers or tank divisions he was

314
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,949
able to come across the Atlantic and

315
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,290
screw with our democracy and we haven't

316
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:59,359
been able to respond to it so in this

317
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,550
day and age is what does Putin wants and

318
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,199
the tools that he uses to get what he

319
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,878
wants is different than what we've seen

320
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,319
in the past I want to go to Brian but

321
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,139
just before I do Brian

322
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:11,540
I just want to as you all know that

323
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,309
these things please go to slide oh let

324
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,170
me get the questions because we're in a

325
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:16,670
fairly informal environment here and I'd

326
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,939
like to make this as much of a

327
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,949
conversation with all of us as as we can

328
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:23,719
right over first I wanted to agree with

329
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:25,639
Jim that that Putin is effectively

330
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,860
trying to create a situation where the

331
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,029
side that best copes with chaos is the

332
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,740
site that's gonna be victorious my

333
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:32,990
colleague Asifa Donnell Jenson's

334
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,819
recently wrote an excellent report on

335
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,619
this I do want to kind of gently push

336
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,899
back a little bit about that we just

337
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:40,279
have a Putin problem because I don't

338
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:42,379
think we just have a Putin problem I

339
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,259
think Putin is the current manifestation

340
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:48,230
of our Russia problem because I think

341
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:50,420
this conflict promises to be a very long

342
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,790
term conflict unfortunately because I

343
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,378
believe it's systemic I believe it's

344
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,449
systemic we're not in a kind of Cold War

345
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:59,089
situation where you're having to kind of

346
00:14:56,449 --> 00:15:00,679
fully formed ideologies facing off

347
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:01,759
against each other but we get to a kind

348
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:03,439
of struggle between two normative

349
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,809
systems and we have a struggle between

350
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:07,550
Western liberalism with all of its

351
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:09,199
faults that we recognize but we

352
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,219
recognizes it's probably the worst

353
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,679
system in the world except all the

354
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,749
others as Winston Churchill once said

355
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,949
and on the other hand you have again

356
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:19,279
what I alluded to in my introductory

357
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:21,049
comments this Sistema right with the

358
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,610
russian émigré political scientist elena

359
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:25,129
LED and yet a call sistiana and what is

360
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,629
this well it's this kind of it's what

361
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:29,029
the russians called Pangea and blackness

362
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:31,069
Piazzi right the the kind of the the

363
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:33,679
system of understanding of informal

364
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:36,199
rules of getting things done of corrupt

365
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,499
and kleptocratic networks and this is

366
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:40,849
how russia is truly ruled and we've

367
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:42,709
allowed ourselves to be kind of fooled

368
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,420
by the forms because Russia has been

369
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,829
ruled this way whether it was ruled by

370
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,479
czars and boyars in general

371
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,460
Terri's and polyp euros or so-called

372
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,040
presidents and Parliament's it's always

373
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,740
been ruled by sistema now sistema during

374
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,300
the Cold War was hermetically sealed it

375
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,820
was hermetically sealed behind the Iron

376
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,140
Curtain it really wasn't our problem

377
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,480
it was the problem of the other three

378
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,670
the other three of co-panelists but Jim

379
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,320
it wasn't your in my problem well guess

380
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,930
what after after the end of the Cold War

381
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,490
in the advent of globalization you and I

382
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,229
were probably pretty naive in thinking

383
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,610
that our Western values were going to

384
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,090
basically spread throughout the entire

385
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,030
world

386
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:19,400
what's happened instead is that Russia

387
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:23,569
has been able to spread the values of

388
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,689
Systema into our systems and to corrupt

389
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,670
and corrode and in undermine our systems

390
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,860
that's what we're seeing right now what

391
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,839
Putin has done and I think every Russian

392
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,920
leader basically is a product of Systema

393
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:39,200
and to a degree is shaped by Systema and

394
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,120
shape Systema to a little and Putin

395
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,310
shaped Systema in his image to a degree

396
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,400
and what he's done is basically

397
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:48,140
externalize it and weaponize it against

398
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,300
the West he's basically taken these

399
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,790
domestic arrangements of using kind of

400
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,260
corruption as a tool of statecraft

401
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,089
effectively in informal networks as a

402
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,100
tool of statecraft and turned it into

403
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,380
something to undermine Western

404
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,080
institutions so well we have a kinetic

405
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:04,579
war in the former Soviet space in an

406
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,110
effort to read to re-establish the

407
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,849
Empire in Ukraine and Georgia

408
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,619
specifically but it could end up in

409
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,899
other places as well I'd keep my eye on

410
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,800
Belarus and when does thereby of passes

411
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,780
from the scene I'd keep my eye on

412
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,579
Kazakhstan to be quite honest but well

413
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,260
then we have a non kinetic war against

414
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:21,020
the West under minor institutions and I

415
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,180
think this is going to continue after

416
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,129
Putin I don't think it I think Putin is

417
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:28,640
just one manifestation of that so it's a

418
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,920
slight nuance in our Brian you're led

419
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,980
neatly to the the obvious next question

420
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,810
which is now that we've defined what the

421
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,940
problem is how are we dealing with it

422
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,320
and are we dealing with it today Andy

423
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,210
differently than we dealt with it five

424
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,629
years ago are we having any greater

425
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:48,620
success than we did five years ago to

426
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:50,450
choose an arbitrary timeline and you

427
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,459
know I want to deal with Georgia for a

428
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,550
second but obviously this applies to the

429
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:58,100
Baltic states as well and there are

430
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,840
thank you there is one person in the

431
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,590
room who's sending a lot of questions

432
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,980
name is anonymous I thank you thank you

433
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:08,689
for that but let's deal with the

434
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,370
question of how we're dealing with it

435
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,650
and when you're talking about Russian

436
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,510
soft power law not kinetic so we know

437
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,820
how to deal with kinetic stuff when they

438
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,879
shoot at us we shoot at them and then

439
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,500
somebody wins and somebody loses but the

440
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,870
soft power is far more difficult to

441
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,600
figure out how is Georgia dealing with

442
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:29,510
that and toivo you would obviously have

443
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,570
a say in this as well as Sophie but and

444
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:36,350
what lessons are there being learned

445
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:41,029
right now in Georgia and other places to

446
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:44,120
deal with this soft power the more we

447
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:46,429
talk about Russia and relations with the

448
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,039
West the more we realize here that

449
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:51,440
that's one of the hardest questions that

450
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,940
this panel is posing but most relevant

451
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,770
and we should be talking about that

452
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,770
particularly for countries like Georgia

453
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,059
it's extremely important that's the

454
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:03,919
audience that we are here and more

455
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:06,590
broadly the international community

456
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,659
fully understands the challenges that we

457
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,049
are facing Georgia Ukraine and any other

458
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:13,039
country the country's sovereignty and

459
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,270
territorial integrity are being

460
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,270
infringed by Russia

461
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:20,870
so here everybody here knows the context

462
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:23,000
well I just since we are comparing where

463
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,158
we stand now what was five years ago or

464
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,460
what was ten years ago

465
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,470
the context is there Russia continues to

466
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:35,000
violate the principles of international

467
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:38,480
law Russia continues to occupy 20% of

468
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,750
Georgia's territories Ukraine's Crimea

469
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,020
annexation and the situation is to

470
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:47,120
Ukraine it simply demonstrates the

471
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,860
magnitude of security challenges that we

472
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,899
are facing in the Black Sea region I

473
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,789
know that everybody in this room

474
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,678
understands this I know that as I said

475
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:55,850
broadly more broadly everybody

476
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:57,200
understand that this should be

477
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,840
highlighted and they should be

478
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,220
recognized more and more the challenges

479
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,830
that we are facing in the Black Sea

480
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,440
region and conventional and

481
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:10,809
unconventional threats and hybrid

482
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,309
threats that undermines Western values

483
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:17,178
how we're dealing with that

484
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:21,019
it's not an easy pass but being an

485
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,730
immediate neighbor of Russia and facing

486
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:26,960
this challenge is almost on a daily

487
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,639
basis obviously conventional are threats

488
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,710
and the occupation is there and the

489
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:34,758
security challenge but I think what

490
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,159
makes us frontline state and here I

491
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:40,159
would like to both perhaps a little bit

492
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:43,039
because Georgia is a frontline state in

493
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,490
many ways and what makes us frontline is

494
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,080
perhaps the values that we share and our

495
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:50,929
commitments to share the values of

496
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:55,939
freedom and democracy that is our

497
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:58,789
biggest instrument and to to counter the

498
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,649
threats that we are facing and our

499
00:20:58,789 --> 00:21:02,749
commitment perhaps that we want to

500
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:05,928
become a member of the European Union

501
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:08,119
and member of NATO and perhaps the

502
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:13,549
resilience that we keep talking about it

503
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:16,600
and I I was in Lithuania a week ago at

504
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:19,460
the Baltic assembly where the Minister

505
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,649
was also there and we had a very

506
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,990
interesting discussion about the unity

507
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:26,299
and the strengths and more strategic

508
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:28,340
vision of Europe and NATO towards

509
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:31,460
countries like Georgia like Ukraine I

510
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:34,820
mean strategic vision practicality

511
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,549
technical assistance it's all there it's

512
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,070
all very important and it's all very it

513
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:41,600
is vital for countries like Georgia but

514
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,460
at the same time it's important that

515
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,799
we've got more strategic vision and

516
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:50,350
yesterday the president of this country

517
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:55,340
made very good remarks about about

518
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:57,320
strong foreign policy and also the

519
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,720
remark that I remembered and I want to

520
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,428
reiterate here that while we argue and

521
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,230
it's not about what it's not Georgia we

522
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:05,269
are not a member of the EU hope but

523
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,539
hopefully we will be a member of you at

524
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:10,749
some point and NATO while we argue some

525
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:14,690
someone else takes the lead so I think

526
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:18,080
that is the issue that we need to talk

527
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:21,139
through the resilience of transatlantic

528
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,059
security and where it lies and why this

529
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,789
is important for countries like Georgia

530
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:26,629
it's about open-door policy it's about

531
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:28,280
in

532
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,700
large amount of the you and this has

533
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,010
been always at the heart of

534
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:37,460
transatlantic security and our

535
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:40,820
democratic values and our commitment and

536
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:44,170
determination to be the front-runner so

537
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:46,639
that this is also an example to other

538
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,310
countries in the region which obviously

539
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,140
does not play into Russia sense so I

540
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,370
want to get you involved in this briefly

541
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,850
if I could and then I've got a question

542
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:58,879
for the menisci yeah I think resilience

543
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:02,870
is really a key word generally speaking

544
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,480
and it's not only resilience so if we

545
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:07,280
was mentioning here the transatlantic

546
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,660
institutions European institutions but

547
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,030
it's the resilience of countries and

548
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:18,290
resilience of countries institutions and

549
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:23,030
and and here I would say that for

550
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:27,290
example in in in the Georgian case the

551
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:32,480
Russia exploited weaknesses that existed

552
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:35,149
in in Georgia made use of the of the

553
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,380
fact that there was death neck tension

554
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:43,100
in the beginning of the 90s and and

555
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,570
jumped right in and and so the the

556
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,320
paradigm of course changed fundamentally

557
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:51,050
in 2008 because that was when when there

558
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,720
was a real war between Russia and

559
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,510
Georgia up to now you had had Russian

560
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:59,830
troops in Georgia but but under the

561
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:05,030
under the heading of peacekeepers but

562
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:08,419
but so the the question again coming

563
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,860
back is is that the the fact that the

564
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,020
Russians came in in the first place that

565
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,449
they had an opening to come in in first

566
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,240
place was the fact that there was there

567
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,310
were these conflicts and if these

568
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,600
conflicts had not been there it would

569
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,370
have been more difficult much more

570
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,590
difficult for the Russians to find a

571
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,000
foothold they might still have tried but

572
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,959
it would have been more difficult and so

573
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:34,970
the question is in in this context what

574
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,500
can we do what can any country do and it

575
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,610
depends of course on the situation of

576
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,320
the country and Georgia's is a

577
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,699
particularly difficult one with the

578
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,120
Russian troops

579
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:46,340
being in south ossetia and abkhazia but

580
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:50,419
nevertheless what can even in those

581
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:56,270
circumstances the Georgian government do

582
00:24:50,420 --> 00:25:00,020
to strengthen its own situation visa vie

583
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:02,030
the population in in south ossetia and

584
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,990
abkhazia in terms of reaching out to

585
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,670
those two those two territories to an

586
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,530
and Georgian government is doing quite a

587
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,840
bit but I think there's more that can be

588
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,180
done precisely in order not to play

589
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,770
along with the Russian PlayBook but to

590
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,590
write your own playbook and I think that

591
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,879
is that is where we are perhaps I think

592
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,510
they've mentioned we was mentioned here

593
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,740
before that that the question is one

594
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,660
question is what are the Russians doing

595
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,850
but the question is also what are we

596
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,730
doing what is our with our our plans how

597
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:34,040
can we strengthen our institutions our

598
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:38,180
countries in order to counteract any

599
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,740
kind of initiatives let me just pick up

600
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:42,080
on that point and I'll throw it out to

601
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,690
anybody and I really their microphones

602
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,399
going around but just a me let me take

603
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,230
my position to pose this question to you

604
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,950
and it was suggested I think by Peter I

605
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,270
don't know where Peter is in the room

606
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:57,410
he's a friend with anonymous by the way

607
00:25:53,270 --> 00:26:01,760
so but you bring up the question of what

608
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:04,100
we can do and it's it's it begs the

609
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,610
question then do we have the will to do

610
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:10,250
it do we have the will to make the

611
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:13,340
sacrifices necessary to have a robust

612
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:16,030
policy and by that I mean when soft

613
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,889
power is used in insidious ways and

614
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:21,740
perhaps I'm talking about oil pipelines

615
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:25,580
or natural gas pipelines and this sort

616
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,860
of thing how let me get your sense and

617
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,189
especially from a Baltic point of view

618
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:33,139
Minister how far are you prepared to go

619
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,330
to stop this and how much do you think

620
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:41,660
that your sovereignty right now is at

621
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:42,949
risk well I just want to come back a

622
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,080
little bit to the previous discussion

623
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:48,020
because I think it is very important

624
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,899
look we have been able to formulate some

625
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,190
kind of basic policies back in 2014 to

626
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:57,490
2016 two levels

627
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:00,100
you and NATO EU has this kind of two way

628
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:03,549
approach and five principles meaning

629
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:06,340
contain and engage put sanctions by the

630
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:08,470
way strange enough but the European

631
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,470
Union has quite coherent policy when it

632
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,330
comes to dealing with Russia but they

633
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,370
are still struggling to find the same

634
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,259
kind of policy to deal with China or to

635
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,779
deal with the United States or the rest

636
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:22,659
of the world that's also a really

637
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:26,320
interesting my country would always hope

638
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:28,750
to have more robust more strict policy

639
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,840
with a V Russia but then I understand

640
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,940
that in order to get whatever kind of

641
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,949
united and more or less efficient policy

642
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,340
we have to compromise all the time and

643
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,159
that's what we did back in 2014-2015 not

644
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:45,490
much has changed frankly but it's also a

645
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,789
good news with all those let's say

646
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:51,460
attacks against democracies in many of

647
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:53,679
you nations we still hold remarkably

648
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,980
well NATO has the same kind of policy

649
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,470
developed from 2014 to 2016 we started

650
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:03,190
with US deployments in the Baltic States

651
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:06,370
April 2014 when we really were scared

652
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,350
and if you compare five years ago the

653
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,330
situation on the streets of Riga tallest

654
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,850
darling and Venus people were

655
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,379
remembering 1940 not anymore

656
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,330
all the opinion polls are showing that

657
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:18,879
there is quite a trust in European Union

658
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:21,309
in the Alliance and people are starting

659
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:23,168
kind of feel that Russia is not anymore

660
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:25,509
so a big threat that's a public

661
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:29,070
perception that is growing back back

662
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:32,440
home we also were able to work out

663
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:34,750
sensible strategy on resilience what we

664
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,509
are lacking we are lacking resources we

665
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:41,289
are sometimes lacking understanding in

666
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:45,250
all capitals in European Union but I do

667
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:49,330
believe that from that point of view we

668
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:51,039
are trying to at least do what is

669
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,860
necessary and to find a common

670
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,350
denominator is there a will to do more

671
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,449
no actually there is a very mixed

672
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,000
feeling we have this kind of North

673
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,559
Stream project developing despite the

674
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,860
objections of many countries including

675
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,000
my own we are now struggling and we are

676
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,158
quite a minority

677
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,169
when it comes to the restoration of the

678
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:13,720
voting rights of Russia in the Council

679
00:29:11,169 --> 00:29:15,970
of Europe the what is coming in couple

680
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,919
of weeks we do believe this is not the

681
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,260
right thing because we see that there

682
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,720
are moves from Russia that are just

683
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:25,299
opposite to what we were expecting like

684
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,020
hospitalization of Donbass like seizure

685
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:32,400
of 24 sailors of Ukraine and then

686
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:36,760
refusing to implement ruling of the

687
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:39,070
International Tribunal of for the law of

688
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,490
the sea so this is a very mixed feeling

689
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:45,850
however I would say that one of our

690
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,830
major kind of efforts right now is to

691
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:50,289
keep what we have achieved at the

692
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:54,059
European level and it's not less I would

693
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:58,000
hope that we would get kind of more

694
00:29:54,059 --> 00:30:00,100
let's say steam more real to do more but

695
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,220
then we need to deal with things that we

696
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,320
were not dealing five years ago we have

697
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,500
a lot of issues with the United States

698
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,750
now from Iran and trade to climate

699
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:13,150
change and also transatlantic bond and

700
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,820
defense spending we have now growing

701
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,549
debate never have seen that before in

702
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:22,809
China and we still need to keep our

703
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:25,000
Eastern partners on the agenda for EU

704
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:27,070
foreign policy so this is a very complex

705
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,990
very mixed feeling and we are not

706
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,460
talking about breaks it here we are not

707
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,980
talking about some other things that I

708
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,140
don't want to mention because then I

709
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,080
would have lecture for a couple of hours

710
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:41,770
and I wouldn't stop mentioning all those

711
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,539
troubles EU or or NATO all of us need to

712
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:48,639
do so this is not good thing to say that

713
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:50,760
we are not doing enough but I also

714
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,510
understand the limits that we all are in

715
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,610
Jim you've been sitting here listening

716
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,070
to a lot of different topics and I want

717
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,590
to bring you in just to respond to some

718
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,110
of it but and there was a question from

719
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,539
Reinhart but it was also on my mind as

720
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,539
well and that is that we are dealing

721
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:10,600
with a Russia that may be outsized in

722
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:13,720
terms of its reputation and what it has

723
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,658
done let's not kid ourselves but its

724
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,600
economy is puny compared to many other

725
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:20,750
countries it has vast Natural Resources

726
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,780
has never been able to

727
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:25,490
turn itself into an economic superpower

728
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,800
is being constrained or should be

729
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,780
constrained somewhat by its own economy

730
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,810
and therefore what you know how it can

731
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:36,290
meet its own ambitions on that front is

732
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:39,710
that a significant deterrent in itself

733
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:42,260
that Russia just doesn't have the money

734
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,150
to do what they want to do well you know

735
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,920
I think it's a very important question

736
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:48,110
and I think about that all the time and

737
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,860
when I was in the Pentagon dealing

738
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:53,389
particularly after the Crimea invasion

739
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,280
and trying to figure out what are we

740
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:58,970
dealing with here

741
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,760
I kept what I kept thinking over and

742
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:04,640
over again we have to look at the facts

743
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,500
as they are and not get lulled into this

744
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,340
idea that that Putin was pumping out

745
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,860
that he's actually 10 feet tall and we

746
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:15,500
can't allow ourselves to make decisions

747
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,919
based on the wrong data and a

748
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,990
misunderstanding of what he really is

749
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,150
and what his capabilities really are on

750
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,280
a regional basis he can cause a lot of

751
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,420
problems and I think our friends here

752
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,590
whether it's in Georgia or Ukraine

753
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:33,320
Latvia Estonia having the Russians on

754
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,270
right there on the border that's that's

755
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,169
a superpower situation right they're not

756
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:41,210
even taking into consideration nuclear

757
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:43,580
capabilities so so it depends on the

758
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:48,410
perspective that you have in terms of

759
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:50,270
what he's able to do and so um so I but

760
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,060
but I think the the most important thing

761
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,820
though in looking at Putin and in the

762
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,100
right context is that while we have to

763
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:00,590
keep in mind he's not ten feet tall they

764
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,330
have these problems within Russian

765
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,639
society whether its funding whether its

766
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,860
military capability I mean the aircraft

767
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,540
we see flying or the old bears and you

768
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,060
know it's not like we're seeing a lot of

769
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,850
new things but that but that's the point

770
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:16,840
just because right now you're looking at

771
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:19,310
Russia using these metrics like DeMott

772
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,010
demographics or GDP or this type of

773
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,870
thing that doesn't mean number one that

774
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:25,400
it will always stay that way and number

775
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,709
two it doesn't mean that he can't take

776
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,080
even the little of what he has and make

777
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,400
it into something very large and that's

778
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,889
what we're seeing going back to your

779
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,550
earlier point about his ability to use

780
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,440
on these

781
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:40,010
new technologies to go in and have quite

782
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,980
a big effect at a very low cost so um so

783
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,440
I think we fool ourselves if we look at

784
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,870
him the way we might have 50 years ago

785
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,730
or 100 years ago or 150 years ago as we

786
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,010
looked at a at an opponent and you

787
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,930
looked at these metrics like GDP in to

788
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,070
demographics and say well they're really

789
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:57,170
not that big a threat

790
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,879
you've lull yourself into a

791
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:01,010
misunderstanding of what you're dealing

792
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,230
with and so we have to on the one hand

793
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,730
not fool ourselves that this guy is ten

794
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,200
feet tall and that the Russians are

795
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:09,590
behind every tree and we're going to be

796
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,409
doing all kinds of things to defeat an

797
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:15,200
enemy that is not as as big as we we we

798
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,790
fear and all bad things that that brings

799
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,949
to your own planning if you're doing

800
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:21,800
much more than you have to do but at the

801
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:24,889
same time don't be fooled that these

802
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,720
weaknesses that we see in fact are not

803
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:28,279
weaknesses when it comes to a regional

804
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,409
problem like Georgia and Ukraine have

805
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:34,130
come into or the fact that they can't

806
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:35,600
use technology such as the Internet and

807
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,520
what we've been seeing in the past as

808
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,279
well as new things like artificial

809
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,350
intelligence hypersonics to achieve a

810
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,120
capability that you would not expect

811
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:47,299
from a country that you might

812
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,100
underestimate just because of democritus

813
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,169
and GDP

814
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,960
I just need all of you to help me out

815
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:57,259
here for a minute we have a restricted

816
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,630
time in fact very short period of time

817
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,460
and I want to get this conversation

818
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,520
going so if you could do me a favor and

819
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,440
if you ask a question or want to make a

820
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,650
point can you do it as briefly as you

821
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,150
possibly can and I will apologize in

822
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,310
advance if you're going on a little bit

823
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,830
too long I'll probably intervene and ask

824
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:18,110
you to wrap it up sir if we got a

825
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,029
microphone we could give I see a couple

826
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,890
of hands going up and I'm also keeping

827
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,950
an eye on slide oh so we're not ignoring

828
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,960
that Jonathan Adler from the Royal

829
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,480
United Services Institute in London I

830
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,030
wonder if I could push you forward with

831
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,340
James Townsend this point looking to the

832
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:37,010
future one of the areas which we see now

833
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:39,080
is the sort of disintegration of most of

834
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,510
the arms control agreements that we have

835
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,299
the nuclear ones the conventional ones

836
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:46,580
in Europe so it's a very complex area

837
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,510
just a simple question to the panel as a

838
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,680
whole

839
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:53,510
do you think we can engage now in a new

840
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,390
disarmament or arms control discussions

841
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,220
with Moscow while avoiding a discussion

842
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:03,950
about the division into spheres of

843
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:10,339
influence who would like to take that

844
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:12,710
Minister okay yes we must do whatever we

845
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,980
can to try to get a new round of the

846
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:18,770
negotiations not only with Moscow for

847
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:21,980
instance INF treaty was obsolete already

848
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:24,080
as the United States pulled out we all

849
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,420
understand that we need also China we

850
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,860
need anyone having said that I have no

851
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,810
illusion that we are not going to start

852
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:32,750
it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow I

853
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:34,910
think that at some point we need to push

854
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:40,850
for some kind of new

855
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:43,069
maybe decades-long but still let's say

856
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:45,440
discussion on on ours control and also

857
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,300
you remember that back in 2007 Russia

858
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,920
was the one to pull out from the

859
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:51,890
conventional forces Europe agreement

860
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,110
that also leaves us in a kind of way

861
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:57,350
where probably we need to discuss this

862
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:59,600
issue we have always see format but I

863
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:02,000
have seen it for many years it's not

864
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,279
very efficient it's not going to be

865
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,800
efficient but still I believe that at

866
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,400
least we need to try to find the way how

867
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,400
we can engage in the new round of the

868
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,910
talks on this one so I began my career

869
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,560
working on salt - a lot of you weren't

870
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:21,589
alive when salt - was being negotiated

871
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,080
and I was a very young man but I say

872
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,940
that because I'm no stranger to arms

873
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,790
control and I'm no strangers to its

874
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:31,970
flaws and how long it takes but I do

875
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:34,000
know from Cold War days all the way up

876
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:37,609
through CFE and into the modern day

877
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,650
there is a place for arms control in the

878
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,950
package of things that nations have to

879
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:45,290
do to deter and to defend themselves

880
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:47,480
there's a role for it there it's not

881
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:50,060
it's something that is hard to do it

882
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,370
takes a long time and it's a boutique

883
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,680
point it's it's there is conventional

884
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:57,109
there's nuclear and but there's elements

885
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,109
of nuclear elements of conventional that

886
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,190
you can tackle through arms control that

887
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,869
gives you more stew

888
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,940
ability at the end of the day you want

889
00:38:02,869 --> 00:38:06,890
deterrence you want stability you want

890
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:09,140
transparency transparency helps provide

891
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:10,759
for deterrence you want these things

892
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,400
arms control can help bring that about

893
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,410
it is not a silver bullet you will never

894
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,329
have peace if you only rely on arms

895
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,310
control but it's something that's part

896
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:22,190
of the package and it's something that

897
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:24,710
we cannot do away with arms control also

898
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:26,990
calls for experts you cannot do an arms

899
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:28,190
control negotiation as a journalist

900
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,779
walking in there and sitting down with

901
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:33,410
the Russians and expect to get anywhere

902
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:36,859
so what we cannot do is lose the people

903
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:38,060
who know how to do this myself included

904
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:40,520
not you're just kidding

905
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,270
but but we need to keep it it's got to

906
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,300
be part of it

907
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:45,950
but it but it cannot be the only leg of

908
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,869
that stool it's got to be part of a

909
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,810
broader package including strong

910
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,970
military strong deterrence and a modern

911
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,040
nuclear capability but you've got to

912
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,160
have the guidelines and the cushions

913
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,630
that come with arms control I'm gonna go

914
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,020
to this gentleman in a minute I just

915
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:06,230
before I do I'm receiving a number of

916
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:08,060
slider questions here which also was on

917
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,550
my question sheet and that is the

918
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,869
elephant in the room which is China

919
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:16,490
and we're talking about this emerging

920
00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:18,770
love affair between Putin and XI I how

921
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:22,419
much of that is going to affect how we

922
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:26,030
deal with the Russian situation can we

923
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:28,970
control or contain or deal with China

924
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,950
without controlling containing and

925
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,839
dealing with Russia first are the two

926
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,660
connected Sophie you want to deal with

927
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:39,020
that

928
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:43,578
well I should say before answering that

929
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:47,690
question that the my answers to those

930
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:49,609
questions would have to bear the context

931
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,460
from my from the perspective of my

932
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:54,140
country and in the best interest of my

933
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:57,940
country there's a lot of Chinese

934
00:39:54,140 --> 00:40:02,720
investment in Tbilisi well Georgia

935
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:08,349
Georgia's ambition is to is to become a

936
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:12,490
hub and there is a lot that we are doing

937
00:40:08,349 --> 00:40:14,360
obviously we have a very strong and

938
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:17,419
straightforward and clear

939
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:20,060
foreign policy and this is clearly

940
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,060
clearly European integration and data

941
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:27,250
integration and this is not just a glyph

942
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:30,529
declared go we are consistently

943
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:33,880
delivering to get closer to these

944
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:37,400
institutions and that's a fact

945
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:40,760
cooperation with China and our relations

946
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:44,980
with China again given the context of my

947
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:51,850
country we are diversifying our markets

948
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:59,450
we are turning Georgia into a hub and we

949
00:40:51,850 --> 00:41:03,700
we do have the relations with China that

950
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:07,580
that that is but that's being balanced

951
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:12,950
and in the best interest and in the best

952
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:14,960
interest of our country Brian first of

953
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,490
all I wouldn't characterize it as a love

954
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,990
affair a characterize it more as a

955
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,680
shotgun wedding that's quickly turning

956
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:23,330
into a dysfunctional marriage I mean

957
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,819
let's face facts I mean Moscow's pivot

958
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,290
to China came as a result of the falling

959
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,390
out of its relations with the West and

960
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:31,700
in that relationship

961
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,990
Moscow is clearly the junior partner to

962
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,740
China although they are very loath to

963
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,419
admit it

964
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,430
but China's viewing Russia as a source

965
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,250
of cheap raw materials and this is begun

966
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:41,810
coming back to haunt Moscow now with you

967
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:43,400
we're seeing protests in the Baikal

968
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,100
region over Chinese investment there

969
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,740
there was even a webpage encouraging

970
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:50,120
locals to throw garbage into Lake Baikal

971
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,379
because they were conspiracy theories

972
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,420
the Chinese were gonna steal all of

973
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,840
Russia's water so the policy of a

974
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,280
Kremlin is increasingly at odds with the

975
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,310
populations of the Far East in Russia

976
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,670
there's a reason that no sino-russian

977
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:06,350
relationship has ever lasted and that is

978
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,730
because neither one of those two

979
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,140
countries wants to be a junior partner

980
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:10,640
in this case Russia is clearly junior

981
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,250
partner I don't I don't see this as a

982
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,600
long-term as a long-term a marriage it's

983
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,430
a dysfunctional marriage that's been a

984
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:19,339
sooner or later coming to an end I think

985
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,750
Moscow's hope is that at some point the

986
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,180
West is going to sue for peace with

987
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:24,500
Moscow in the in the interest of

988
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,828
confronting China I think that's what

989
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,969
they're hoping for and that's what

990
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:30,299
gambling on but I don't think it's gonna

991
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:31,729
happen thanks Brian microphone to this

992
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:34,170
channel oh you are Michael sent

993
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:35,399
Alexandra jitter to come from European

994
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,709
secret research initiative foundation

995
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,259
from Ukraine key and that one question

996
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:41,578
about some point I think you and miss

997
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:43,680
key in this difficult discussion this is

998
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:45,809
a Russian civil society how he should

999
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,399
influence is this entries because

1000
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:49,259
without having support from civil

1001
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,049
society from I mean whole Russian

1002
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:53,519
society it will be impossible just to

1003
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:56,279
execute any kind of policy towards

1004
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,229
Ukraine towards no Georgia don't Crimean

1005
00:42:56,279 --> 00:43:00,209
and all other things do you have any

1006
00:42:58,229 --> 00:43:02,640
kind of ideas how to increase Russian

1007
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:05,190
society to make the changes then to push

1008
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,558
some kind of pressure on the ruling

1009
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,890
elites to destroy this system a

1010
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:15,900
so-called thank you Umberto I would be

1011
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:17,129
model well I I would I would first of

1012
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,459
all civil society is indeed very

1013
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:22,859
important I think from from a new

1014
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:25,558
perspective actually the European Union

1015
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:28,348
has been trying and he is continuing to

1016
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:30,329
try to engage with Russian civil society

1017
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:32,640
and to serve and to to work with Russian

1018
00:43:30,329 --> 00:43:35,039
civil society to what extent it is it

1019
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,690
has become also more more difficult to

1020
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,279
engage with Russian civil society

1021
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:43,650
because of greater restrictions but but

1022
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:47,190
I mean but in general I agree with you I

1023
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,859
think I think it is important to

1024
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:53,489
strengthen civil society whatever

1025
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:56,640
whatever we can do that that ultimately

1026
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:59,699
again I think the ultimate hope and goal

1027
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:03,058
for any neighbor of Russia is that that

1028
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:05,339
Russia at one point maybe not tomorrow

1029
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:08,699
maybe not next year but at one point

1030
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:11,578
turns around and and becomes a big

1031
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:13,499
country but a country that its neighbors

1032
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,119
actually feel reasonably comfortable to

1033
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:16,439
live with and I think that's there a

1034
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,900
civil society will be extremely

1035
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,630
important no III agree with that

1036
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,759
completely we've seen during the Soviet

1037
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:26,849
Union days the importance of civil

1038
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:28,920
society and I wasn't very very evident

1039
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:30,749
during those days in Moscow where those

1040
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,579
folks were they were underground and

1041
00:44:30,749 --> 00:44:35,488
this type of thing but but now there

1042
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:37,229
there's still some civil society that we

1043
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:38,550
can work with but you're right it's

1044
00:44:37,229 --> 00:44:41,100
they're getting much

1045
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,450
or much smaller they've harder to find

1046
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:44,880
and under a lot of pressure because

1047
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:46,439
Putin knows that too and it goes back to

1048
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,240
this point about Putin he's not gonna

1049
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,180
sit there and allow the United States

1050
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,600
for example for us to go in and to

1051
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,460
create this opposition to him and he's

1052
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,860
already been battling that we all we all

1053
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,310
know that so how can we figure out a way

1054
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:04,290
to support civil society to support all

1055
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:06,950
the things that civil civil society can

1056
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:11,040
do in Moscow without causing a blowback

1057
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:15,270
and and wrecking what's left there and

1058
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,430
that's a that's a that's a hard task for

1059
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,960
an open society to do there's a lot of

1060
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:23,910
things you can do quietly behind the

1061
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,890
scenes but but but that one that's

1062
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:29,129
discovered and found out can cause

1063
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,750
massive problems so your question is a

1064
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,010
very good one is there important one and

1065
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,380
I just don't think there's any really

1066
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:38,280
good answers except to continue to be

1067
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:41,430
persistent and try try try try do you

1068
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,110
want to say something bright I think we

1069
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:44,759
have to come I kind of come to terms

1070
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,680
with the fact that our ability to affect

1071
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,050
events inside of Russia is extremely

1072
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:51,020
limited and that the west engaging with

1073
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,610
civil society as laudable as that is

1074
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,650
puts that civil society in danger and I

1075
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:57,690
think the business of changing Russia is

1076
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,400
up to the Russians and after Russian

1077
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:01,530
civil society I would disagree with you

1078
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,660
that we can't help Ukraine without

1079
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,490
engaging Russian civil society I think

1080
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,319
well you crane is an area where we

1081
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,790
certainly can happen and have an impact

1082
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,710
I think we should be focusing our

1083
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,450
efforts on the countries like Ukraine

1084
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,810
and Georgia and to a lesser degree

1085
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:18,750
Moldova that have chosen to go west to

1086
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:20,820
break free of this sistema and I think

1087
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,340
we this is where we should be placing

1088
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,890
our efforts and I'm more of the mind

1089
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:27,510
that we need to contain Russia right now

1090
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:30,900
and leave the business of changing

1091
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,850
Russia up to the Russians Mark Kelly Adi

1092
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,860
I don't know where you are mark you're

1093
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:37,950
right there let me read your question

1094
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,630
and then ask you can the West do

1095
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,419
anything positively to make Russian

1096
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:46,050
policy less hostile or is our only

1097
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:49,550
option to deter and outlast can you give

1098
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,550
me 30 seconds more on that

1099
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:58,829
oh are you mark i I don't know why I

1100
00:46:53,670 --> 00:47:00,240
thought he looks just like you okay sure

1101
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:02,760
thanks very much mark guarantee also

1102
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:04,740
racing um yeah I'm just just to sort of

1103
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:09,270
anyway riff off this this this last

1104
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:11,069
point I mean the question is civil

1105
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,710
society is only one part of that overall

1106
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:17,599
equation do we just simply accept that

1107
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:18,920
Russia is going through its own

1108
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,020
post-imperial

1109
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:25,290
crisis I say this is coming from brexit

1110
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:27,000
land and therefore we just have to start

1111
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:29,579
to make sure it can we minimize the

1112
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,290
damage it can do to the rest of us or is

1113
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:32,670
there anything we can do positively to

1114
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,470
address it because the thing that

1115
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:35,760
strikes me is when I'm in Moscow time

1116
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:37,379
and time again I talk to people within

1117
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,150
the system and as far as they're

1118
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,359
concerned they are at war with the West

1119
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:43,859
and the West started it now that's wrong

1120
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:46,078
but nonetheless it is genuinely believed

1121
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:49,230
do we just have to live with that or can

1122
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,839
we do anything about it sure briefly and

1123
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:53,130
then maybe to Sophie

1124
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,660
thanks for setting up what I've been

1125
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,849
wanting to say through the entire panel

1126
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:58,529
I mean I think we do have to I would say

1127
00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:00,180
that we can only contain the damage

1128
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:01,950
right now basically I don't I don't

1129
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:04,109
think there's anything we do to to

1130
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,578
positively change Russia's behavior and

1131
00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:07,980
I think we have to come up with a kind

1132
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:09,960
of 21st century policy of containment

1133
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,480
for lack of a better word I mean I call

1134
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,010
it hybrid containment because it's not

1135
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,720
your grandfather's containment it's not

1136
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:17,280
putting some tanks in the folded gap it

1137
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,450
starts with resilience the minister was

1138
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,460
talking about her and I would concur

1139
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:21,839
that laffy has done a great job along

1140
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,000
with the other Baltic states in

1141
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,650
constructing kind of resilient societies

1142
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,599
and I think this is something we can all

1143
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:30,119
learn from there's a direct correlation

1144
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,000
between levels of corruption and the

1145
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:34,980
levant and in levels of resilience visa

1146
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,480
vie Russia's Russia Russia's active

1147
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,700
measures and I think countries that have

1148
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,619
done a great job on corruption like

1149
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,990
Estonia light laughing in like Georgia

1150
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:44,430
have been much more resilient against

1151
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,799
against Russian active measures so kind

1152
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:48,029
of the battle begins at home but you

1153
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,920
also have to be able to deter Russia

1154
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,050
there has to be an honor or else right

1155
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,280
there has to be an or else and I've I

1156
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:55,980
mean my colleague Edward Lucas has

1157
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,270
proposed snap financial exercises where

1158
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,280
we basically kind of run through

1159
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:02,160
financial exercises of what assets we'd

1160
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,480
freeze and when what what what bank

1161
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,060
accounts we'd seize

1162
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,500
in the event of Russian aggression

1163
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:09,330
hybrid kinetic non kinetic or otherwise

1164
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,980
again again against our ally so I think

1165
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:12,990
we have to start thinking in these terms

1166
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:14,820
I think we have to start thinking in

1167
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,109
terms of early warning systems we have

1168
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,970
early warning systems for nuclear

1169
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:19,319
weapons and for terrorism we need kind

1170
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:20,700
of early warning systems for weaponized

1171
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,920
corruption so I think we have to start

1172
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,660
thinking through what containing

1173
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,030
something like this means in the 21st

1174
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,950
century and Jim I want to go to you but

1175
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:30,810
you know an interesting part of what

1176
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:33,060
you're saying though and this applies to

1177
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:34,859
the Baltic States in particular where

1178
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:38,250
the electrical grid is still controlled

1179
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:40,680
by Russia and how easily it would be for

1180
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,720
them to cause mischief back if we cause

1181
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,919
mischief going forward and Minister I

1182
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,299
want to get your reaction to that and

1183
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,340
then Jim I want to go to you well I I

1184
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,020
and I don't want to get political here

1185
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,850
in terms of US politics talking about

1186
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:54,119
brexit land we've got our got our own

1187
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:56,100
land back in the US but I but I think

1188
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,920
there's there's going to your question

1189
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,600
about looking what can we do there's a

1190
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,480
player we really haven't talked much

1191
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,368
about and I think we have to and that is

1192
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,500
I think one of the things that we can do

1193
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,390
belong squarely on the lap of the United

1194
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,460
States and we've got to have a clearer

1195
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:14,129
policy about dealing with Russia it's

1196
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,500
it's a bit muddled you've got the

1197
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,660
pentagon studies and the NSC studies and

1198
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,880
the Supercat the competition between the

1199
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:23,910
US and Russia but there is a leadership

1200
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:26,330
part that the United States has is weak

1201
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,980
on right now in terms of helping to

1202
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:30,930
propel unity with a NATO or within

1203
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:33,150
within Europe as we try to deal with the

1204
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:35,009
various aspects of Russia we're not as

1205
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:39,540
strong as we have been in the past in

1206
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:41,820
terms of a solid agreed-upon strategy

1207
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:44,130
and policy and leadership dealing with

1208
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:45,660
Russia we need to return to that and

1209
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,400
that's one of the things that we can do

1210
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:50,850
is to try to have a stronger policy

1211
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:55,260
dealing with Russia and to lead Minister

1212
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:57,750
briefly on the grid well still coming

1213
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:00,330
back also to the civil society let's not

1214
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:02,280
forget that Russia civil society is also

1215
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:04,319
very different and when we speak about

1216
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:06,359
Russia civil society for instance the

1217
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,920
view on Crimea would be totally

1218
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:12,270
different depending on whom you speak so

1219
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,490
if you speak about Ukraine and

1220
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,460
assistance Ukraine don't assume that

1221
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,229
everyone in the Russia's

1222
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,750
shishun or civil society would say that

1223
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:23,900
you should return Crimea to Ukraine in

1224
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:27,589
two weeks time we take take over or

1225
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:30,920
second on this kind of engagement with

1226
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:32,240
civil society I would say two things and

1227
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,910
I very much agree with those who are

1228
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:37,700
saying that the system can change itself

1229
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:40,040
only with promising like in all good

1230
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,740
days of the Soviet Union but if we meet

1231
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:45,529
with representatives of civil society if

1232
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,810
we show that they are important to us

1233
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:50,780
that we want to speak with them that

1234
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:52,970
actually also gives some moral boost to

1235
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,369
them and also to work with them but

1236
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:58,339
let's not go into financing them because

1237
00:51:55,369 --> 00:52:00,320
in that case you will find that there

1238
00:51:58,339 --> 00:52:02,839
will be accusations of taking foreign

1239
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,390
money spying and being the agent of

1240
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:07,580
influence an electrical grid and the

1241
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:09,410
energy look I think that if you look at

1242
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:14,180
the Baltic states we have done

1243
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:19,730
remarkable work already to a model from

1244
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:24,200
the gas supply so we are now able to get

1245
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:25,940
more gas supplies from not only Russia

1246
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,279
but from different parts of the world we

1247
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,530
have allergies we have inter characters

1248
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,150
building and now the second issue that

1249
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,940
we are now working with the European

1250
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:38,000
Union and I hope that by 2025 or so

1251
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:42,290
you'll be able also to connect with the

1252
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:45,080
European Union our grid and to let's I

1253
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:48,200
say goodbye to Russian Belarus but then

1254
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:50,900
again I was myself part of Latvian

1255
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:53,419
delegation back in 2010 visiting Moscow

1256
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,700
which then president and one thing that

1257
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:59,599
Russian leadership said back then and it

1258
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:02,089
hasn't changed if you pay your bills you

1259
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,339
will get electricity and gas and by the

1260
00:53:02,089 --> 00:53:07,130
way with all our back political

1261
00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:09,589
relations economic part and while you

1262
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:11,690
are paying bills that part has always

1263
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:14,779
worked with Russia so it's always about

1264
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,609
money at the end of the day can I just

1265
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:18,080
and I I apologize I know that there's

1266
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:21,369
other people who want to ask questions

1267
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:24,410
and and we are mere moments away from

1268
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:25,910
coming to an end on here but I did want

1269
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,430
to bring up a question that I think

1270
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:29,960
might be on a lot of people's minds

1271
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:32,210
especially those who

1272
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:36,349
don't come from the United States which

1273
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:38,470
is basically all of us except for J Jim

1274
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:40,910
and Brian I

1275
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:44,299
Jim you brought it up and the question

1276
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:46,368
is that in in foreign policy especially

1277
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,359
dealing with Europe and and and now

1278
00:53:46,369 --> 00:53:52,310
dealing with Russia

1279
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:54,619
the u.s. is giving us a confused picture

1280
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:57,500
the u.s. is being belligerent to their

1281
00:53:54,619 --> 00:54:00,710
to their trade allies let alone to their

1282
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,390
military allies and I'm wondering and I

1283
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,520
take this because the president the

1284
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:07,190
outgoing President of Slovakia said this

1285
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,589
yesterday in his speech and that is that

1286
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:12,560
it is time for a more European response

1287
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:14,450
to this as opposed to and I think and I

1288
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,490
don't want to put words in his mouth or

1289
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:18,790
even thoughts that may not have been

1290
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:21,049
there but it does beg the question

1291
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:24,130
should the rest of the world

1292
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:27,710
particularly Europe and its extensions

1293
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:29,300
develop a new type of leadership for

1294
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:32,540
dealing with this or should we double

1295
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:35,599
down on a highly unpredictable US

1296
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:39,140
administration where do you go would be

1297
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:42,109
a disaster if Europe developed its own

1298
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:44,629
way to go as a hedge against the United

1299
00:54:42,109 --> 00:54:46,790
States because of the events over the

1300
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:48,710
past couple of years but number one

1301
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:51,680
thing we need is unity transatlantic

1302
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:53,150
unity as hard as that is and it's been

1303
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,220
hard in the past too this isn't

1304
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:57,380
something new we the transatlantic unity

1305
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:00,169
has had its ups and downs since 1945

1306
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:02,450
this is this isn't new I would say that

1307
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:04,700
there's new elements and there is a a

1308
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,779
louder megaphone from the White House

1309
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:09,319
saying things are you know you're not

1310
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:12,200
used to hearing but but but and I will

1311
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,540
also say too there is a need for Europe

1312
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,819
a strong Europe a strong European Union

1313
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:20,119
a strong European defense industry there

1314
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:24,320
is a need for a strong European sense of

1315
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:26,630
self too but not not up not not in

1316
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:29,330
opposition or in counterbalance to the

1317
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:31,310
United States or or as a result of

1318
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:34,670
politics in the United States which is

1319
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:36,589
transient like all politics are so I

1320
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:38,630
think as terms of what the European

1321
00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:40,490
Union is doing what some European

1322
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:43,099
capitals are talking about in terms of a

1323
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:45,919
European identity you mean see us a

1324
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:47,450
above and beyond CSDP a strong Europe is

1325
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,849
helpful to the transatlantic

1326
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:52,009
relationship we don't want that but what

1327
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:54,729
we don't want is two separate entities

1328
00:55:52,009 --> 00:55:57,140
going about dealing with adversaries or

1329
00:55:54,729 --> 00:55:59,359
competitors in two separate ways we've

1330
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:01,038
got to have unity that's got to be the

1331
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:04,308
case we're going through a rough patch

1332
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:06,229
now we will see where politics go but

1333
00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:09,979
for for gosh sakes what we don't want to

1334
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:12,439
do is its make decisions in Europe based

1335
00:56:09,979 --> 00:56:14,749
on politics in the United States that is

1336
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:16,880
transitory and the same thing in Europe

1337
00:56:14,749 --> 00:56:18,229
Tube politics politics in Europe are

1338
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,599
transitory and we don't want to do

1339
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:23,269
things in the United States based on

1340
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:25,460
that so we've got to stay unified that's

1341
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:27,738
the key the context to the question from

1342
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:31,819
a Canadian perspective was that until a

1343
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:35,630
week ago we had tariffs slapped on steel

1344
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:37,849
and aluminum because on a 2/3 - we posed

1345
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:40,849
a threat to the national security of the

1346
00:56:37,849 --> 00:56:42,950
United States Canada we don't even pose

1347
00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:47,569
a threat to ourselves let alone to the

1348
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:49,308
United States but a toy oh and Sophia I

1349
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:50,930
know everybody want to get in on this so

1350
00:56:49,309 --> 00:56:53,809
we'll do this the final round no I just

1351
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:57,078
take her what he said what Jim said and

1352
00:56:53,809 --> 00:57:00,529
the fact that that in today's world

1353
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:05,809
neither the United States nor Europe can

1354
00:57:00,529 --> 00:57:09,469
in the end just do it alone because we

1355
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:11,539
have a huge and rising China we it's a

1356
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:13,579
question of who is going to set the

1357
00:57:11,539 --> 00:57:16,999
rules of the world that we live in and

1358
00:57:13,579 --> 00:57:19,940
and if we if we have this rift that we

1359
00:57:16,999 --> 00:57:22,640
in this these disagreements that we have

1360
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:25,539
between the US and Europe right now if

1361
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:30,499
that deepens if we if we drift apart

1362
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:32,299
then we are only serving others neither

1363
00:57:30,499 --> 00:57:33,769
of us is going to win from that and so

1364
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:36,979
in the end it's a question of just

1365
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:40,519
sticking it out and and counting on on

1366
00:57:36,979 --> 00:57:42,589
getting back together again because

1367
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:44,299
because this is the only way we can

1368
00:57:42,589 --> 00:57:46,369
ensure that those values that we share

1369
00:57:44,299 --> 00:57:48,859
actually across the Atlantic that these

1370
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:52,059
that we can push these values forward

1371
00:57:48,859 --> 00:57:52,058
also in in the future

1372
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:59,390
yeah because that was the point that I

1373
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:02,170
wanted to make as soon as the panel is

1374
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,170
almost over

1375
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:08,059
it's the power of unity and that's how I

1376
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:11,200
started my remarks and it's the

1377
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:15,049
resilience but there are certain caveats

1378
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,808
of building resilience and I want to go

1379
00:58:15,049 --> 00:58:20,839
back to the point that I made earlier

1380
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:23,660
that transatlantic unity and resilience

1381
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:26,328
lies in open door policy and enlargement

1382
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:29,660
of the European Union and NATO and this

1383
00:58:26,329 --> 00:58:31,880
has been always at the heart of Hewitt

1384
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:33,828
wanting security and this is from the

1385
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,289
perspective of Georgia from countries

1386
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:38,539
like Georgia which are again maybe I

1387
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:40,359
repeating myself but I think that's a

1388
00:58:38,539 --> 00:58:42,859
very important point that I'm making

1389
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:44,779
that particularly for countries like

1390
00:58:42,859 --> 00:58:47,119
Georgia who have chosen the paths and

1391
00:58:44,779 --> 00:58:49,400
are determined to continue this path

1392
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,190
it's extremely important that these

1393
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:56,059
messages this unity is maintained and

1394
00:58:52,190 --> 00:59:00,770
this is an encouragement for us for us

1395
00:58:56,059 --> 00:59:03,559
for Ukrainians to have the light at the

1396
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:05,690
end of the tunnel thank you just before

1397
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:07,910
I go to the minister because I and and

1398
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:09,650
and Brian should just picking up a

1399
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:13,578
Sophie's point as the time come for us

1400
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:17,079
just to bring Georgia into NATO anybody

1401
00:59:13,579 --> 00:59:21,770
disagree with that okay

1402
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:25,609
Minister over to you well indeed it was

1403
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:28,460
time to bring Georgia to NATO in 2008

1404
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:32,500
and we didn't do that in Bucharest and

1405
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:34,940
we got the August of 2008 but that

1406
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,609
that's the history and we still think

1407
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:40,490
that it's a hard time to keep our

1408
00:59:37,609 --> 00:59:43,369
promise however this panel sounds like

1409
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:44,750
the ordinary European Union Foreign

1410
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:47,000
Affairs Council or NATO foreign

1411
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:50,329
ministerial we always talk about unity

1412
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,390
and solidarity and we agree always that

1413
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:55,099
we need unity and solidarity and by the

1414
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:56,990
way things are actually much better on

1415
00:59:55,099 --> 01:00:00,230
the ground and they are in the virtual

1416
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:02,598
reality if you look of what's a NATO I

1417
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:04,309
would say that I'm very happy to see

1418
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,170
that all the decisions of Warsaw summit

1419
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:09,200
of 2016 have been implement

1420
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:11,029
and also the decisions at very famous

1421
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,618
Brussels summit where the Pres got it

1422
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:15,289
wrong and actually the reality was

1423
01:00:12,619 --> 01:00:17,119
totally different in the closed room we

1424
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:19,579
see that this is a very mixed picture

1425
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,170
and I'm not going to be very original we

1426
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:23,539
are living in a very strange world where

1427
01:00:21,170 --> 01:00:26,269
we sometimes get something happening in

1428
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:29,059
those small gadgets and we comment as

1429
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:32,689
diplomats on tweets and Facebook posts

1430
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:34,670
and then when we speak about real things

1431
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:37,220
then sinks again out a bit bit better

1432
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:39,109
but from my perspective I just want to

1433
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:41,058
leave with three short points first of

1434
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:45,019
all for us for the small European

1435
01:00:41,059 --> 01:00:47,599
countries it is very very important not

1436
01:00:45,019 --> 01:00:48,799
to be put in the position where we are

1437
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:50,869
asked the question are we better

1438
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,900
Europeans or are we better transatlantic

1439
01:00:50,869 --> 01:00:57,349
cysts because we all understand that

1440
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:59,690
u.s. role in Europe's security is the

1441
01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:01,519
same like it was thirty forty or ten

1442
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:02,210
years ago or five years ago it's very

1443
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:05,479
important

1444
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:07,880
second I do believe that sometimes we

1445
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,950
are lacking a dialogue between Europe

1446
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,410
and the United States for instance when

1447
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:14,868
we are talking about new ideas on the

1448
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:17,359
common security and defence policy it's

1449
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:19,490
not that they are kind of contradictory

1450
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,098
to NATO but when Europe is ready to

1451
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:24,618
spend more money as Europe on mobility

1452
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:27,049
or our infrastructure that is also

1453
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:28,490
useful for defense then I think it's the

1454
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:30,288
right thing to do and sometimes our

1455
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:31,879
American friends are looking at with

1456
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:33,980
some suspicion that we are creating

1457
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,420
something that is parallel or

1458
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:37,849
contradictory no it's actually

1459
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:40,220
complementary even the biggest skeptics

1460
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:42,829
of the United States in Europe are

1461
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:45,470
understanding that the United States and

1462
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:47,180
NATO is important and final point where

1463
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:49,970
I believe Europe is getting it wrong

1464
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:51,558
this is defense spending and this is

1465
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:54,009
where I would agree with all the

1466
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:56,990
American administrations I remember from

1467
01:01:54,009 --> 01:02:00,049
President Clinton President Bush Obama

1468
01:01:56,990 --> 01:02:02,089
and now president Trump all of them are

1469
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:04,730
asking and begging European allies to

1470
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:07,279
spend at least two percent and only six

1471
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:11,450
or seven countries by the last count of

1472
01:02:07,279 --> 01:02:13,940
NATO are doing that out of 30 almost 30

1473
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:16,189
members of the Alliance so this is a

1474
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:18,349
very mixed feeling so to make a blame

1475
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,970
game that the current administration is

1476
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:21,160
worse than the

1477
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:23,560
in the United States or Europe based

1478
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:26,049
fragmented it's not the case but we have

1479
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,490
our problems to solve and many problems

1480
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,920
to support okay

1481
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:32,049
Thank You minister and and just unless

1482
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,640
there's any confusion at all edgar is

1483
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:36,670
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of

1484
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,740
Latvia I know somebody thank you for for

1485
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:40,810
mixing up me with Estonia normally I get

1486
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:46,089
mixed up with Lee Swain here so this was

1487
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:48,610
something no all right I'll get the last

1488
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:50,320
word to you I'm not gonna say anything

1489
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:52,570
terribly original here I want to give a

1490
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,310
ringing endorsement to Jim's passionate

1491
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:55,810
call for transatlantic ISM going back to

1492
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:58,150
the question you began this panel with

1493
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:59,440
if we go down that path of splitting the

1494
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:02,080
transatlantic alliance we're giving

1495
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,700
Putin one of those main things that he

1496
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,259
wants it's a big gift to Putin and we

1497
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,450
can't do that but beyond that I mean the

1498
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:09,580
like the canadian-american relationship

1499
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,410
and I say that as a proud American of

1500
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:14,200
Canadian descent and a proud North

1501
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:16,509
American this relationship is deeper

1502
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,339
than any one u.s. president and the

1503
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:20,470
transatlantic relationship is deeper

1504
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,580
than any one u.s. president so I think

1505
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:23,169
we we've been through rough patches

1506
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:26,290
before we'll get through this rough

1507
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:30,480
patch and I think they basically keep

1508
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:33,430
calm and carry on us as mark would say I

1509
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,070
that brings us to the end so Jim toivo

1510
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:37,240
Edgar Sophie and Brian thank you all

1511
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:37,990
very much and thank you for

1512
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:44,169
participating

1513
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:44,169
