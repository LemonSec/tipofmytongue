1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:12,420
I'd much rather be engaged in with the

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,000
u.s. involved 40% of the world's market

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,009
then disengaged be on the outside

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,980
looking in financial crises are now

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,810
global if one country sneezes the whole

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,449
world catches the cold it's really the

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:29,070
wrong time to be putting more frictions

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:32,850
more cost more uncertainty around the

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,579
short-term economic picture we are now

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,670
negotiating the budget but we do not

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,140
have a vision so we are first looking

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,149
how much we have and then how we will

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,280
send it I think it should be always the

14
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,920
opposite but there is no perception of

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,170
sunshine Europe in Brussels and that is

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,730
something that people in this region

17
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:58,760
have to do I would love to see the

18
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:03,169
Europeans not talk about the theory of

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,459
European defense but actually produce

20
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,840
capabilities and then also to use them

21
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:11,250
to spaces that I feel Express the

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,229
technological gold rush of our time one

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,909
is cyberspace and I did that a lot of

24
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,189
stuff with NATO

25
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,259
the other one is outer space our elected

26
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,270
leadership has to understand that the

27
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,950
future of liberal democracy depends on

28
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,839
our capacity to defend ourselves in the

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,580
cyber domain exposure and public

30
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,290
awareness are really critical to

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,289
building resilience if data is a

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,030
lifeblood then that's going to be the

33
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,770
driver of competitiveness we should

34
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,380
regulate for openness for democracy

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,520
you

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,520
