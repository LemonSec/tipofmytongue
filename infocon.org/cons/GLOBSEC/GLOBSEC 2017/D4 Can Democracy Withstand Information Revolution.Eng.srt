10
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:28,470
Koch so good afternoon everyone good

11
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,619
afternoon to our audience here in

12
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,020
Bratislava and to our many viewers

13
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:37,860
watching us around the world on Facebook

14
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,750
live I know as you watch that video it's

15
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,180
a bit troubling right so as someone

16
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,410
declared that we're living in a post

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,490
truth world of alternative facts where

18
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:53,009
some for their particular agendas what

19
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,949
is not to believe what we know not to

20
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,470
believe our own eyes not to believe what

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,119
we read or see or hear and in our

22
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,220
mainstream media but instead to believe

23
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,160
what someone has tweeted what someone

24
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,630
has pushed out on Facebook now

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,429
researchers at the University of

26
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,220
California took a look at a five-week

27
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,280
period in the fall of 2016 in the run-up

28
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,720
to the u.s. election from September 16th

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,019
through October 21st they found that

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,970
nearly 20% of political tweets were not

31
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:27,780
generated by human beings but by BOTS in

32
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:29,519
in France the Oxford University did a

33
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,110
study they looked at the run-up to the

34
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,080
election last month they found that a

35
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,239
quarter of a quarter of political links

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,730
that were shared were based on false

37
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,530
information I mean I could go on and on

38
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,988
but I want to get to the terrific panel

39
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,890
that I have here to help us look at this

40
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:51,120
issue of being fake news disinformation

41
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,890
misinformation propaganda and what kind

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
of a threat does opposed to the world's

43
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,970
democracies I'd like to start by first

44

democracy in Washington welcome all

60
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,900
before I go to questions I would like to

61
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:40,858
pull the audience looking back say five

62
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,950
years five years ago either in print or

63
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:45,840
online how many of you read a news story

64
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:48,298
now I'm not talking about satire but a

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,909
news story that you discovered was

66
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,230
actually false false and deliberately

67
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:56,548
misleading how many of you five years

68
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:59,159
ago okay not too many all right let's

69
00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:01,019
say within the last year how many of you

70
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:05,519
have read a news story online in print

71
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:09,799
whatever that was fake news okay wow

72
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,689
that is a significant difference that's

73
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,389
unfortunately not surprising mr.

74
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:17,579
secretary I'd like to go to you first

75
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,949
how great a threat do you think that

76
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,169
this misinformation disinformation

77
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:24,419
propaganda the explosion and today is it

78
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,580
to our nation's or our world's

79
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,820
democracies the u.s. in and around the

80
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,919
world well it's a complicated answer so

81
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,500
first let's define what we mean by fake

82
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,130
news and there are stories that are

83
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,020
slanted with bias or where the inference

84
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:44,310
drawn you might think is a false

85
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,900
inference and you know an example for

86
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,470
example might be in the area of climate

87
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,210
change

88
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,030
some people might regard a story that

89
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,620
says there's no correlation between the

90
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,960
weather and climate change and there is

91
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,159
no climate change as a fake story there

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,280
are people who actually believe that

93
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,840
then you get into issues of stories

94
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,198
where there's it's completely fabricated

95
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,729
and fabricated with the purpose which is

96
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,289
what I think we mean by fake news and

97
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:08,849
then you get to what I think is the most

98
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:11,039
extreme example which is literally

99
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:13,080
altering a document or photograph and

100
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,639
putting it out there so it's a forgery

101
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:20,039
or otherwise a manipulated actual quote

102
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,659
piece of evidence so how much of a

103
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,270
threat is at the democracy well in one

104
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:25,949
way we've lived with this since the

105
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,710
birth of democracy I'm going to go back

106
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,840
to the history of the u.s. shortly after

107
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,940
the founding of the country it was not

108
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,060
uncommon to have scurrilous newspapers

109
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,980
affiliated with a

110
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,130
little parties and they would make

111
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:41,650
allegations of sexual impropriety or

112
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,440
theft or whatever against the political

113
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,150
opponent of their patron and the

114
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,280
Republic survived what I think has

115
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:52,799
become different here is two things one

116
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:55,239
is the social media revolution and

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,930
Twitter and other platforms that allow

118
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,660
the dissemination of information have

119
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,120
dramatically a multiply the number of

120
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:07,419
entry points for even people who want to

121
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,030
deliberately use propaganda secondly

122
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,070
it's made it possible to curate what you

123
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,919
see so that you don't have to see

124
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,750
conflicting or contradictory information

125
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,760
so there's much more potency but is it a

126
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,610
threat well and so the third thing is

127
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:24,159
you can actually operationally interfere

128
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,380
with for example the police by putting

129
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,720
out false Twitter information that

130
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,030
actually gets people to for example wind

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,280
up creating a traffic jam so the LAT the

132
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,500
list would certainly be a threat to the

133
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,510
ability to maintain order on the other

134
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,120
two I would say it's a threat only if

135
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:42,310
people allow their ability to

136
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,039
discriminate between what is true and

137
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,840
false to erode it's okay to read a false

138
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
story if you have the critical ability

139
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,510
to understand why it's false but if you

140
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,849
wind up training yourself only to read

141
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,469
the news you want to read and that

142
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,650
supports your point of view then we do

143
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:03,490
get into an area that's worrisome

144
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:06,159
Gabriela you're the CEO of Facebook Mark

145
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:08,650
Zuckerberg has long insisted that that

146
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,350
Facebook and I know Google believes the

147
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,210
same thing here you are neutral

148
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:15,400
technology platforms and so you really

149
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:18,250
don't have a responsibility for the

150
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:21,429
content that people put on your site

151
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:23,500
your platform but at the same time you

152
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,570
know and then in after the election in

153
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,930
2016 he still maintained there's a

154
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,610
pretty crazy idea crazy idea right that

155
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,229
Facebook could have actually impacted

156
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,360
the election results in the United

157
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,070
States but then in December Facebook

158
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,039
didn't about vais fais and said okay

159
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,539
well now we're going to take action

160
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,219
against this so good what happened

161
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:45,130
explain the about-face and what are you

162
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,850
doing we still feel that we are a

163
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,280
neutral technological platform

164
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:52,990
but it doesn't mean that we do not have

165
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,780
responsibilities and we do not shy away

166
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,180
from our responsibilities and in the

167
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,448
past half year we've been putting a lot

168
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:04,030
of resources and working very hard to

169
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:06,550
tackle the issues of a fake news on our

170
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,770
on our side the fake news is not a

171
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,289
facebook specific issue it's a societal

172
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:16,000
issue but we happen to be the biggest of

173
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:19,270
information sharing platform so of

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,009
course our responsibilities are huge in

175
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,159
the past couple of months we rolled out

176
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:27,000
several products what if I just counted

177
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:31,210
very quickly so that now users can

178
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,679
report fake news they can report

179
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:37,630
disputed news ones and user stories

180
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:40,329
flagged as a disputed story that is

181
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,130
ranking higher that other users when

182
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:45,399
they see it shared they are aware that

183
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,620
it's a disputed story they can see the

184
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,110
links connected to the disputed story

185
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,660
which provided the link provided by the

186
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:55,630
fact checker with the alternative

187
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,339
opinion there are several other products

188
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,339
some are in the pipeline some are

189
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,560
already out there but what is more

190
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,450
important and what we do alone on our

191
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,609
platform is that we are collaborating

192
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,709
with other players because as I said

193
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,420
this is not just Facebook issue

194
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,400
you re finding it's working I mean I've

195
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,170
heard some reports that once something

196
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,640
is disputed it actually gets more shares

197
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:20,199
I don't have this is a test phase of our

198
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,180
products that are rolled out in some

199
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,060
countries like in the u.s. in the UK in

200
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,400
Germany in France so we don't really

201
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,709
know how the product works and we really

202
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,720
want to have the feedback and see

203
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,599
whether that's really the option that

204
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,339
adduct will be the solution pretty much

205
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,170
feel that there with the solution will

206
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:43,120
be a layered there is no one bullet that

207
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,640
can kill the whole issue of fake fake

208
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,290
news and false news but will have to

209
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,180
have several several options

210
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,180
that's I'd like to go to Martha come on

211
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,729
go to Google you are often described as

212
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,439
the financial engine of fake news

213
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,360
because for those who don't know how it

214
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,279
works what what tends to happen is that

215
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,510
that people who are trying to spread

216
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,430
false news will

217
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:08,050
spread it first on Facebook often

218
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:09,699
setting up false accounts not not run by

219
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:12,370
actual humans but hundreds and hundreds

220
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:14,170
of them get people to click on the

221
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,670
sensational news stories go to the web

222
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,410
and share them and then they go to the

223
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,889
website and click and if that particular

224
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,420
website has subscribed to Google Adsense

225
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:25,120
then with every click on the website on

226
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,920
that story the purveyor of it makes my

227
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,160
and some of they made quite good money

228
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,459
right so but we saw that this was going

229
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,040
on all through 2:16 during the u.s.

230
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:37,719
election we saw it happening during a

231
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,110
French election and they seem to be

232
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,800
operating with complete impunity what is

233
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:47,560
Google doing if anything address that's

234
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,579
very briefly I could just say that this

235
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,649
is this is fake news but the problem is

236
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:55,989
more complicated we are aware of the

237
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:58,000
mechanism and what we do is every single

238
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,000
year we apply hundreds of changes to our

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,480
algorithm when and in which we're trying

240
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,790
to prevent that we're trying to identify

241
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:11,440
those websites that are aimed at missing

242
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:13,480
misrepresenting the information and this

243
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,839
is this an ongoing process only last

244
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,970
month we've announced our new change of

245
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,779
guidelines when we do not allow to plant

246
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,819
our ads on those on those websites and

247
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:27,130
we can we can be a reactive we are

248
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:30,069
responsible for being reactive and we

249
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:32,260
see that as the as the way forward but

250
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:35,529
we also see that that we're only part of

251
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,269
the solution and whatever whatever we're

252
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:39,610
going to end up with on our side doesn't

253
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:41,829
mean that the whole concept of fake news

254
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,810
or misrepresenting information will

255
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:46,229
disappear from the web or overall from

256
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,969
the from the from the from the society

257
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:51,970
that's why that's why one of the

258
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:55,510
solutions above all the tech ones that

259
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:58,630
you can read about in in in the media on

260
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:01,600
our blogs and and I could leave them

261
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,730
here we really call for changing how we

262
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,360
look at education and we education very

263
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:10,569
educating our societies and if you know

264
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,910
it's like digital skills that that few

265
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:14,949
years back everyone would say coding is

266
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,780
what we what we all need to do but

267
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,850
now turns out that critical thinking in

268
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,699
the interaction with the with the weapon

269
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,860
and the internet seems to be the one

270
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,570
that we should all get to know James I

271
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,730
know it's got to be frustrating for you

272
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,500
you come from the media background that

273
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,350
I do and there are a lot of restrictions

274
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,690
on a traditional news organization what

275
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,880
you print has to be factual it has to be

276
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:40,480
accurate we're breaking all and you can

277
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,880
be sued what do you think there are some

278
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,980
that say Facebook for instance as the

279
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,960
largest disseminator did you realize

280
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,240
that Facebook is the largest

281
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:51,850
disseminator of news in the entire world

282
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,740
that that makes them qualify as a media

283
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,080
organization that they should have a

284
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,640
news editor that they should abide by

285
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,020
the same standards the BBC does CNN does

286
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,250
well I think that that does I think

287
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,650
you've already heard that that that's

288
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,020
contested ground and that the social

289
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,630
media platforms argue and continue

290
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,329
continue to argue that they are carriers

291
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:14,890
rather than broadcasters and I think

292
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,900
that is coming under some challenge now

293
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,699
and you can see some of these responsive

294
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,290
measures it's they've moved on as you

295
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:23,230
were suggesting moved off the territory

296
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,760
of simply saying it's not nothing to do

297
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,070
with us and now to some of these

298
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,260
measures which suggest perhaps there is

299
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:33,430
a little bit of a shift going on but I

300
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:35,290
was interested in the secretary Chertoff

301
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,170
where you started with trying to tease

302
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,640
out some of the distinctions perhaps

303
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,860
with with fake news because I think it

304
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,750
is a very useful concept and it's

305
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,290
particularly useful in drawing people's

306
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,880
attention to the difficulty of

307
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,550
inaccurate and misleading news but I do

308
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,120
think it covers a pretty wide spectrum

309
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,910
of things from people who are in

310
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,440
Macedonia famously deliberately you put

311
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,530
it pumping out full stories for

312
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,360
commercial gain actors who are putting

313
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:05,920
it out for political purposes and I

314
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,750
think we've seen that perhaps well

315
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,490
certainly alleged to be happening in the

316
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,550
in the French presidential context

317
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:14,170
although I think Sputnik for example

318
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,250
denied that that was happening but but I

319
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,760
think there's another thing which I

320
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:20,350
think we need to be wary of which is

321
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,620
people casually using the phrase fake

322
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,240
news meaning news they don't really like

323
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,250
and you've done all transference yes I

324
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,570
think that's a different kind of focus

325
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,460
but as I understand

326
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,750
you had accurately characterized just

327
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,070
now what what the situation is with

328
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,590
advertising revenue around social media

329
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,380
posting so I don't think it's helpful to

330
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:45,130
kind of use that as a fend off when you

331
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,290
do see it increasingly in with with

332
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,450
actors politicians perhaps who are in a

333
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,699
corner and they and they they're

334
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,950
learning this habit of saying fake news

335
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,130
whereas what they mean is Inconvenient

336
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,680
Truth Chris I'd like to ask you what do

337
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,110
you think I mean you have been studying

338
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,300
this and you work on the issue of

339
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:07,090
democracy and and the threats that that

340
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,469
our democracies in the world face should

341
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,600
we have been better ready for this

342
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,940
particularly in the United States when

343
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,880
when you look at states in nations in

344
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,350
this region in the Balkans and the

345
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,570
Baltic states they've been dealing with

346
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,780
this for years how is the u.s. caught so

347
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,670
flat-footed I would first answer that

348
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,380
the question you posed at the outset as

349
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:31,300
to whether this is a threat I think it's

350
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:33,310
a very serious threat the indicators

351
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,949
we've had over the years starting just

352
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,680
with a very clean date of a decade ago

353
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,780
in Estonia when a cyber attack was

354
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,449
launched against that country was one of

355
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,339
the first real clear indicators to all

356
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,320
of us that things were changing and I

357
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,360
think this is reflective of how

358
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,010
dramatically the media landscape has

359
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,880
changed you polled the audience at the

360
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:57,040
outset and it was probably a factor of

361
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,689
20 to 1 where the hands went up for

362
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,170
those who had consumed fake news in the

363
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:03,910
last year and I think the the changes

364
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,040
that we're experiencing now have been a

365
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,530
long time in the making but they're

366
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,260
manifesting very abruptly at this point

367
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:13,660
I think we could have and should have

368
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,450
been better prepared I think we're still

369
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,610
slow on a number of levels to recognize

370
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:21,130
the depth of this challenge both the

371
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,530
changes to the economics of the of the

372
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,630
news industry the way in which content

373
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,939
is delivered and the way in which malign

374
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,950
actors can participate in the

375
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,440
manipulation of that content Facebook

376
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,360
itself through a white paper it recently

377
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,190
released acknowledged this and so I

378
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,630
think I'd make that required reading for

379
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,700
those who haven't seen it yet because

380
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,860
it's a very important document but it's

381
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,490
reflective of the depth of the challenge

382
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,580
and I

383
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:49,770
I fear that in the absence of really

384
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:52,750
concerted collaboration across sectors

385
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:54,490
urgently that we are not going to be

386
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,800
able to meet this challenge because the

387
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,920
resources that are coming in for example

388
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,540
from Russia in this fight are enormous

389
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,240
and they're concerted and they're

390
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:07,000
applied in a unitary way and this is

391
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,699
something we haven't been focused on

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,199
sufficiently until very recently before

393
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,150
we go to the audience and I do want to

394
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,890
bring you in here real quickly I wanted

395
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,829
to go to secretary Chertoff to explain

396
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,959
to us this new research initiative on

397
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,300
the part of the globe SEC Policy

398
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:24,400
Institute it's called D for defending

399
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,169
democracy in the digital domain you

400
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,449
remember the International Advisory

401
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,070
Board talk to us about that what are the

402
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:32,110
solutions well I think as we've

403
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:35,379
identified just in the in the discussion

404
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,820
here you know the term fake news can

405
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,400
cover a lot of different things and

406
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:42,070
solutions engage a lot of different

407
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,750
possibilities at one end I've heard

408
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,480
people argue what we ought to just stop

409
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,160
fake news on the two countries that will

410
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,290
be the first ones to sign up to that

411
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,800
will be Russia and China because their

412
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:55,090
idea of fake news is CNN BBC or anything

413
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,149
that says something bad about the

414
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,399
leadership on the other hand there's the

415
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:02,470
view that some take that platforms are

416
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,150
totally neutral it's nothing more than

417
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,220
like a highway on which people drive

418
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,559
back and forth and just like the toll

419
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,690
taker on the highway isn't responsible

420
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,190
for what somebody does when they pass

421
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,990
through the toll and if they go rob a

422
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,240
bank afterwards it shouldn't be the

423
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,370
platform operators we're looking at a

424
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,080
lot of different things I think we want

425
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,120
to do the research and really understand

426
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,040
the phenomenon and I think we want to

427
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,590
look at solutions that are focused on

428
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,600
such things as can you attack the

429
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,860
financial incentives that generate fake

430
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,959
news can you distinguish automated

431
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:37,000
efforts to surge fake news that don't

432
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,880
deserve free speech protection because

433
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,130
BOTS don't get free speech how do you

434
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,230
look at the issue of anonymity

435
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:47,140
should that be something that's barred

436
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,780
or not barred to be said that that

437
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,570
becomes a tool used in order to prove a

438
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:55,540
fake news and then how would you deal

439
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,439
with the operational confusion that

440
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,659
could be caused in

441
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,360
of a crisis if people started to use

442
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,970
Twitter to put out information about for

443
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,719
example where there's an outbreak of a

444
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:10,030
serious illness or where there's a big

445
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,610
problem on the highway and that actually

446
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:13,990
had impact on the ability to respond so

447
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,689
I don't think that we come into this

448
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,840
with answers but I do think we come into

449
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,570
with a desire to be clear about what the

450
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,830
issues are and to make sure that the

451
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:26,290
cure isn't worse than the disease

452
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,379
because we could do a lot of damage to

453
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,750
democracy if we invited censorship in

454
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,760
the name of defending democracy let's go

455
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:38,620
to the audience okay we have a hand back

456
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,960
here or even mic back here Allen Riley

457
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,540
Institute for statecraft the question I

458
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,370
got to ask is surely there was there are

459
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,770
a lot of problems and these are new

460
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:50,620
challenges there is a lot of history

461
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,220
here which suggests that we've been here

462
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,199
before

463
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,550
and we can successfully with it the

464
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,090
greatest example of this is perhaps

465
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:00,070
Goebbels in the 1930s Nazi propaganda

466
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,500
was supposed to undermine the ability of

467
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,300
the West defend itself that this is

468
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,200
gonna be a terrible Fifth Column egg

469
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:10,450
against the Western alliance it was a

470
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,800
problem they had new techniques they had

471
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,870
new approaches they were using new

472
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,270
technology but within three or four

473
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:20,969
years the western lands had worked out

474
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:23,170
how to respond and by 1943 1944 all

475
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,240
population of Europe was only listening

476
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,300
to British and American channels and by

477
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,590
1944 there only the German population to

478
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,790
find out what was really going on was

479
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,080
listening to British and American

480
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,659
channels so what's your question and my

481
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,820
point is is that yes of course this has

482
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,340
happened yes we didn't expect it well

483
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,950
surely the point is here it's now a

484
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:45,280
matter of responding working out the

485
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:47,230
response and the history suggest that we

486
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,690
can actually come back and effectively

487
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,880
deal with this and whether it's through

488
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,340
authentication and all the other methods

489
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,990
which we mentioned we can deal with this

490
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,179
there is actually a history here of

491
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,740
saying we tend to panic we then try and

492
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,180
work out how to deal with it and we do

493
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:04,000
deal with it can we drop it

494
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,710
Chris do you think well I think one of

495
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,290
the distinctions today and Michael

496
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,530
Chertoff alluded to this I think the the

497
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,530
velocity

498
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,830
the degree of saturation the intimacy

499
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:18,139
the ubiquitous the ubiquity of new media

500
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:21,110
and social media presents some slightly

501
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:23,570
different challenges and for malign

502
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:27,620
actors who are figuring these things out

503
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:30,620
very quickly now the the ability for us

504
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:33,649
to inoculate ourselves I think is is a

505
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,879
far higher degree of difficulty I still

506
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,070
think it can be done and what you're

507
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,860
suggesting is you need more political

508
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,240
solidarity and more resources invested

509
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,428
into these things in a more meaningful

510
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,480
way that's that's another part of this

511
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:49,700
discussion it's very relevant to it and

512
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,280
maybe too far afield for the purposes of

513
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,179
this session but I think that's part of

514
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,340
it

515
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:57,200
but I think we can meet the challenge

516
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,570
the question is whether political

517
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,130
leaders and the democracies have an

518
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,049
authentic commitment to meeting that

519
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:05,240
challenge I think by the way you're

520
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:07,460
right and I'm reminded of the fact that

521
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,549
in the u.s. when you go to the grocery

522
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,470
store they usually have newspapers at

523
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:14,360
the checkout counter like the National

524
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:17,390
Enquirer and the globe are lovely

525
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,799
tabloids right that have headlines like

526
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:24,590
aliens inhabit you know Barack Obama's

527
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:27,470
head or but nobody no one believed well

528
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,658
but so the point is that but the point

529
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,299
is no one believes it and that's because

530
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:34,760
we know the source and when you're a kid

531
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:36,200
you're taught by your parents that if

532
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,090
it's a National Enquirer or the

533
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,570
worldwide globe you don't take it

534
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,908
seriously

535
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,289
likewise with gurbles the challenge I

536
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,789
think with social media particularly

537
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:46,760
when it comes in the form of what

538
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:49,360
appears to be an ordinary person so it's

539
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,190
word of mouth is that it may come with a

540
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,620
wrapping of credibility because the

541
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,780
sourcing makes it look as if it's just a

542
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,479
friend of yours or just an ordinary

543
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,190
person in question here and if you would

544
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,820
identify yourself please sure sure

545
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,799
thanks very much

546
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,539
I'm honored Feinstein from the wilfried

547
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,539
martens Centre for European studies in

548
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:11,929
Brussels and one of the proud sponsors

549
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:14,150
of this event so I would like to focus

550
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:17,929
on the question of the optimal balance

551
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:21,830
between government and civil society in

552
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,830
the response to disinformation you know

553
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,240
with for the

554
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,100
for the Kremlin everything is clear it's

555
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,930
it's top-down right it's from the

556
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,810
Kremlin to the TV channels to the last

557
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:34,110
troll in the 12 factories and BOTS and

558
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:38,070
whatever that's vertical as one form of

559
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:39,479
what they call vertical now I would tend

560
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,750
to believe our response should be

561
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,880
bottom-up right but based on civil

562
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:49,560
society based on think tanks political

563
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:52,170
parties networks individuals volunteers

564
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:54,210
and all this what precisely when you say

565
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,760
body oh you mean yeah and then but which

566
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,170
role is to be played by governments and

567
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,300
state institutions and international

568
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,670
organizations like the European Union

569
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,310
NATO in in responding to this

570
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:09,600
information so without replicating the

571
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:11,580
the vertical top-down approach of the

572
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,980
Kremlin so when you say responding to do

573
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,860
you mean by maybe Germany is proposing

574
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,570
fines for those who don't fight no sir

575
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,189
you just you're you say propose are you

576
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,889
proposing that we respond in kind

577
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:26,120
my question is what is the right balance

578
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:29,610
between government legislation and

579
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:33,239
people hired by governments on the one

580
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:35,729
hand and civil society you know on the

581
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,510
other hand what's the proper response of

582
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,030
a free society

583
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:40,860
okay um who wants to take that guy right

584
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,850
well let's let someone else martyr

585
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,100
Gabriela Smith on I think that the issue

586
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:52,379
cannot be tackled unless there is a

587
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:54,480
healthy media ecosystem that is one side

588
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,200
and the other side of the issue is what

589
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,900
we cover by fake news and false news

590
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:04,410
catchable face and when we are talking

591
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,560
about information operations how that

592
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:10,110
false news is amplified and how we allow

593
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,540
that being amplified when we are talking

594
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:15,959
about how the media ecosystem that's

595
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:18,480
where how the different players like

596
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,980
social media like publishers can work

597
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,690
together but I'm pretty sure that here

598
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,120
there is a big role for governments as

599
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:27,660
well to play because there is a changing

600
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,729
way how people read news how journalists

601
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,540
write news and how the news is

602
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:35,820
disseminated of course I don't think

603
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,649
that rushing into regulation

604
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,720
is the right way to do because it's an

605
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,590
extremely complex situation I'm pretty

606
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:45,570
sure that it's not only Facebook who is

607
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:49,770
debating extremely heavily that what is

608
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:53,070
false news whether a piece of satire

609
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:55,980
that there's a piece of sexual piece

610
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,689
which has in an opinion ended is a fake

611
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,430
news but or something that is true today

612
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,100
and tomorrow something happens or

613
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,020
yesterday's news became false news how

614
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,449
to deal with all those situations and

615
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,790
every time this is a freedom of speech

616
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,030
of someone and it's pretty sure that's

617
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:15,139
not for operators technical companies to

618
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:17,790
become the arbiter of shoes there are

619
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,770
billions of users out there and the

620
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:22,080
billions of users are bombarded with

621
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,360
pieces of information and we need to

622
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,939
help them how to read that news how to

623
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,040
interpret that how to make sure that

624
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,140
they get it better it's whether it's a

625
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:34,800
false news or not publishers are doing

626
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:38,930
that since centuries when they are

627
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,930
writing pieces when they are editing

628
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,920
newspapers now we have to educate the

629
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:47,430
users and there's a huge role for the

630
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,230
government to step up on news literacy

631
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:50,910
education James I think you had

632
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:54,930
something just to build on the point you

633
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:57,540
are making about the the journalistic or

634
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:59,480
news environment overall I think that is

635
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,540
an important point and I think that

636
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,280
there's a place for in some ways perhaps

637
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,159
trying to address the point you're

638
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:10,560
raising I think that there is a is some

639
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,300
space which is neither of the two things

640
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,270
you say the top down or the bottom up

641
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,669
but a healthy independent media sector

642
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,800
plural media sector is a big part of the

643
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,640
equation here because if you don't have

644
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,409
trusted news sources people rely on

645
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,680
untrustworthy and untrusted news sources

646
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:31,380
and we've commissioned some research

647
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:33,330
which indicates that the UK experience

648
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,460
has been somewhat different to the u.s.

649
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,629
experience I think we all know and part

650
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,060
of the reason we're having this

651
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:42,540
conversation is the the wake-up call

652
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:45,720
that people got because of events in the

653
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,460
US election but the UK u.s. experience

654
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,810
was somewhat different and it seems to

655
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,230
have been different in too

656
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:55,560
principal respects is that we have quite

657
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,960
a strong thriving popular newspaper

658
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,220
culture still so that that's a source of

659
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,110
information that people are familiar

660
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,200
with going to and that those businesses

661
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,610
are migrating online I think the the

662
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,380
issue for them is that is the

663
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,969
sustainability of their business models

664
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,470
and I think there's a whole again

665
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,880
probably outside the scope of this

666
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,890
session but there's a whole concern

667
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,430
there about the people who have

668
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:20,010
traditionally provided a lot of

669
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:22,320
trustworthy news are in some sort of

670
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,000
financial difficulty but the other and

671
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,419
closer to home for me is public service

672
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,310
broadcasters because that is a an

673
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,050
intervention and perhaps you'd expect me

674
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,659
to say this but I still believe it that

675
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:36,120
the BBC in the in the in the British

676
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:40,590
landscape and to a lesser extent through

677
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:43,679
its international operations in in in 27

678
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:45,899
28 languages and growing that that

679
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:49,680
intervention is in itself part of the

680
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,150
equation because you have then a trusted

681
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,210
source I think you you then have the

682
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,130
issue of in this world digital world

683
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,530
we're moving into can people find their

684
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:00,360
way into trusted sources in the way that

685
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:03,270
they have in the past but I do think

686
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,040
that that it's sometimes been a little

687
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,200
bit of a Cinderella in the debate public

688
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,710
service broadcasting but I think it does

689
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,570
it does have a place Chris did you want

690
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,490
to add something cuz I know you and I we

691
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:16,889
had talked about and I misspoke earlier

692
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,720
I think it was 50 billion euro fine that

693
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,030
the Germans are are considering for any

694
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,590
platform social media networks that

695
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,050
didn't delete fake knows it we were

696
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:27,050
discussing how Ukraine has just last

697
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,980
week I think pulled the plug on all

698
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:30,120
Russian or they have decreed that it

699
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,590
should happen I don't know it's happened

700
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,050
yet all Russia in the social media

701
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:37,050
networks so to if I understood the

702
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:40,590
question correctly I think the challenge

703
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:44,879
for democratic societies is to marshal

704
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:46,649
the key elements of both civil society

705
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,900
the commercial sector the tech companies

706
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,450
and the appropriate role for government

707
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:53,820
which has to handle some of this either

708
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,010
in a regulatory fashion or in the

709
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,860
national security context which this is

710
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:00,480
very relevant to because there was one

711
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,919
wake-up call some feel it was the u.s.

712
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,340
election I think the annexation of

713
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,799
Crimea

714
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,260
eeeh and Russia's weaponization of

715
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,510
information to take territory was

716
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,429
principally an information war was a big

717
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,679
wake-up call and you had an enormous

718
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:15,510
response a very erupt abrupt response

719
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,029
from governments it was halting

720
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:21,090
piecemeal from civil society but civil

721
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:23,850
society has a role to play like memo 98

722
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:27,000
in Slovakia like globe SEC in helping

723
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,428
explain the issues to a wide range of

724
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,590
audiences governments have a role in the

725
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:35,340
more national security sphere and the

726
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,080
tech companies or the digital the modern

727
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,199
digital companies whatever we call them

728
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,740
today they have a role to to figure out

729
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,809
how they can make sure that politically

730
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,140
consequential information is reaching

731
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:51,750
audiences in a way that helps these

732
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,130
countries and doesn't undermine them are

733
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:55,289
you concerned Martha what you hear about

734
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,899
this government intervention regulation

735
00:30:55,289 --> 00:31:00,809
pulling the plug so looking at the role

736
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:02,760
corporations should play this is a very

737
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:05,490
general question and I think this role

738
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,500
has been has been heavy revolving but I

739
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,330
still darg you that the role of a

740
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,070
company like Google is to provide best

741
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,830
possible services and encourage free

742
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,870
speech and I don't think that the fines

743
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,539
approach is necessarily the right

744
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:20,129
approach and part of the problem part of

745
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,309
the response as you as you put it in

746
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,690
your question it's already there and

747
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:26,580
when you think about what Internet

748
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,830
platforms brink on the positive side is

749
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,320
several sources of information when you

750
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,928
when you go to a search result you don't

751
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,178
only get fake news you may get of course

752
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:37,860
you may get one but you're gonna you may

753
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:39,750
also get different perspectives and also

754
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,479
what you get and this is something that

755
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:44,850
would not happen in under authoritarian

756
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,190
regimes that we saw at the very neo of

757
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,510
this session you you don't you didn't

758
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:50,700
have a chance to argue with that

759
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:52,020
and then Internet is also a place that

760
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,260
can give you an opportunity to

761
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:57,029
immediately respond so and there is

762
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,760
valuing that as well and that's also the

763
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:01,679
question - what - what mr. secretary

764
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,710
said before that what is what is fake

765
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,330
news and it's not always it's not always

766
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:10,080
false information sometimes it's

767
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:12,240
something that we find unpopular or or

768
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,710
something that we don't like don't that

769
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,840
we don't like as a community but

770
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,750
unpopular reviews are also important

771
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,918
to get visibility actually that raises a

772
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:22,559
question and I know you wanted to

773
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,720
address that Gabriela but speaking of

774
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,879
views you don't agree with that's a

775
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,630
concern that some in the in the

776
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,750
conservative you know organizations in

777
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,850
the United States are worried about as

778
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:37,950
face book talks about addressing this

779
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:41,879
problem because they feel like Facebook

780
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,200
is a liberal entity and therefore may

781
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,480
end up violating their free speech

782
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,070
rights by saying oh this is fake news

783
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,110
when it's really just conservative are

784
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:56,370
you know obviously Gabriela well I mean

785
00:32:52,110 --> 00:33:00,000
either because I just wanted to address

786
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:03,209
that the journal law but yeah we can we

787
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,970
can take this this angle as well because

788
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:08,640
fake new or false news many times it's

789
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,039
not illegal lying is not illegal and

790
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,100
something that is a statement truth

791
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,020
statement for me it can be a false

792
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,090
statement for someone else there are

793
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:21,240
some soft lies that there are some great

794
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,699
areas as well to heat a lot of debatable

795
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,279
areas here when we try to define what is

796
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,860
for cross news so naturally we as

797
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:31,559
Facebook we want to be unbiased in a

798
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:33,090
neutral technological platform and only

799
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,059
enable people that they can communicate

800
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,709
with each other that they can connect

801
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,740
with their constituency that they can

802
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:43,830
debate with each other so that we want

803
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,899
empower people that they can have civic

804
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:49,199
engagement on our platform and that they

805
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:52,799
can that we can build an informed global

806
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,220
community of course naturally in the

807
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,020
debate there will be always people and

808
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,080
government who feel that we are not

809
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:03,000
doing enough or that we are siding with

810
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,399
the other side that means that we are

811
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,080
doing a good job because if nobody feels

812
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:10,500
that we are siding with someone else

813
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,629
that means that we are not unbiased so

814
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,570
we have to we have to stay there and we

815
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:18,060
have to be neutral on the German law I

816
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:20,849
feel really strongly about that because

817
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:23,699
that law says or that is not a lot

818
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:24,690
that's a bill there's a heavy debate

819
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,299
around that there are a lot of

820
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:29,168
international

821
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:33,260
human rights organizations selective

822
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:35,899
activities industry groups international

823
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,270
European and in Germany as well we're

824
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:40,790
contesting that bill because it is

825
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:43,130
extremely heavy-handed bill and it is

826
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:47,540
unproportional e restricting freedom of

827
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:49,850
speech it's and it puts a burden on

828
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,800
companies to make the judgement whether

829
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:54,020
something is legal or not legal

830
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,730
and whoever if you are dealing with hate

831
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,640
speech you know that hate speech issues

832
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,980
can be sometimes clear-cut most of the

833
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,589
time extremely layered and extremely

834
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,920
complex and no wonder why courts

835
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:08,900
traditional courts spends months to deal

836
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,760
with an issue and to get all the

837
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:14,030
background to know who is saying why

838
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:17,450
seeing what was the context what was the

839
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:19,610
environment technological platforms is

840
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,069
such a scale there's no ability for them

841
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:24,050
to do that when there are so huge fines

842
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,640
what do you think what will come what

843
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,560
will companies do when they are

844
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,150
threatened with such fines that they

845
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,120
will settle okay let's move everything

846
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:35,750
down that is coming closer to being

847
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,490
illegal and then that will mean that

848
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,760
these companies will take down much more

849
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:42,080
content that they have should've so yeah

850
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:44,810
I was going to say I mean I think and

851
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,569
this law in Germany would be a disaster

852
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:49,580
I mean first of all in the United States

853
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:52,370
this is classic violation of free speech

854
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:54,049
in the First Amendment and what you'd

855
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,240
rapidly get to the case were American

856
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,190
based companies which they were not

857
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,890
going to obey that and the United States

858
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:03,320
government would one would expect say to

859
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,460
the Germans excuse us but we're an

860
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,950
independent country you're not going to

861
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,690
regulate what our citizens can hear I do

862
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,270
think there are things platforms can do

863
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:15,110
though that are neutral for example you

864
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:18,290
can detect as you do with spam automated

865
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:20,360
postings and you can block that you can

866
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:23,090
change the financial incentive structure

867
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:25,580
that drives people to post fake news not

868
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:28,520
for pure political reasons but simply

869
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:31,250
for for financial gain and I think that

870
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,259
would have have an impact to you might

871
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,920
is a little trick you you might deal

872
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:39,130
with use of anonymity and either

873
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,360
separately cabin

874
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:44,120
anonymous postings or if you're for

875
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,910
example on Facebook you might enforce

876
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,670
the rule about people verifying their

877
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:52,430
identity when they go online to post or

878
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,710
you know it is actually you know Michael

879
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,690
Chertoff there you know me as opposed to

880
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,980
someone pretending to be me because part

881
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,590
of what I think that they're trying to

882
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,230
do with Facebook is make the reader

883
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:05,450
believe his friend believes this so it

884
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:07,610
gives it a false credibility so I think

885
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:09,169
there are things that can be done that

886
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:12,080
are neutral that don't get us into

887
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,550
dangerous places you know it's

888
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,770
interesting on the point of Facebook I

889
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,510
mean I personally just among my circle

890
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:19,670
of friends on Facebook and I go on there

891
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:21,980
every day I have seen a real explosion

892
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,440
in the number of people who are trying

893
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,330
to copy my friends identities and poses

894
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,070
them and I I don't know if they are

895
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,410
trying to send out fake news I don't

896
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:33,620
know if they are trying to exploit their

897
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:35,330
name and say hey I mean I'm Jane your

898
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,970
best friend I'm in Europe and I've lost

899
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:40,340
my passport please send me money but but

900
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:42,259
it you do see this increase in people

901
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,090
trying to pretend to be someone that

902
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,140
they're not but we have let me bring the

903
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:46,700
audience back and I think we have a

904
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:49,160
question in the front here yes hello my

905
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,020
name is Iman Hana my there is a

906
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,879
fascinating report by the Center for

907
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,890
international media assistance at the

908
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,150
net so Christopher Walker probably knows

909
00:37:54,890 --> 00:38:01,910
about it that says that there is roughly

910
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,770
only 50 million dollars a year in

911
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,660
overseas development aid that goes to

912
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,670
media development and only a tiny

913
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,589
fraction like in a single digit that

914
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,210
goes to media and digital literacy so

915
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,280
very often we talk about the importance

916
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:16,040
of building the skills of the readers to

917
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,950
be able to you know detect what

918
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,870
potentially is fake news or unverified

919
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,000
information and median digital literacy

920
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:25,069
is of course wide but it's a tiny tiny

921
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,840
fraction of an already tiny fraction of

922
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:29,000
overseas development aid so there is

923
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,390
definitely room for improvement here but

924
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,350
the title is about the floor thank you

925
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:35,150
defending democracy in the digital

926
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,259
domain and the information revolution it

927
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,850
goes beyond fake news

928
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,820
so my question specifically is about

929
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:42,710
elections voter data and what can be

930
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,110
done with the voter data with a big data

931
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:47,420
generated by people's geolocalization

932
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:49,700
their preferences where they go online

933
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,450
and how it can be exploited for

934
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,750
electoral purposes in

935
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:57,480
to target specific voters there is a

936
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:59,610
total absence of regulation around

937
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,890
elections but what to do with the data

938
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:04,110
can parties by that that I use that data

939
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:05,970
and how and of course in some countries

940
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,880
the legal system is strong but in others

941
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:10,560
is completely absent that's a little bit

942
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,540
out of the fake news realm no but

943
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,400
anyways very mention of evolutionism

944
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:17,340
that's a great question but it is not

945
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,170
this initiative is not just about fake

946
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,210
news it's about defending democracy

947
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,490
against a wide variety of digitally

948
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,990
based press I think you identify a very

949
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:27,689
good threat first of all we obviously

950
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:29,819
are concerned about anybody tampering

951
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:34,770
with the actual mechanics of voting or

952
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:37,380
registering in in data second I'd be

953
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:40,200
concerned for example about an effort to

954
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:41,940
target particular communities with false

955
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,799
information about how you vote or where

956
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,810
you vote let's imagine for the sake of

957
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,590
argument someone wanted to suppress

958
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:52,500
voting among minorities of Latin descent

959
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:55,290
and they sent out tweet saying emergency

960
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,270
alert you're going to be deported if you

961
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:58,950
go to the polls I mean that could have a

962
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:01,980
real effect in election so I think

963
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:06,049
there's a wide variety of things which

964
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:10,290
need to be be solved differently and

965
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:11,880
finally I would say that again and we

966
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:14,600
shouldn't only view this as how do you

967
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,950
stop things but it's how do you promote

968
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,779
good understanding and critical thinking

969
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,580
about these things just to let just a

970
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,200
tack on it like it's just a just

971
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:25,880
directly to that point and the point you

972
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:28,980
raised we our main TV current affairs

973
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,480
flagship program not just 10 days ago

974
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,500
did a report looking at some of these

975
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,630
issues and highlighted for example micro

976
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,460
targeted messages to voters telling them

977
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:40,140
that Republicans were meant to vote on

978
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,480
one day and Democrats on another and

979
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,009
that's the kind of thing like fake news

980
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,040
and voters the impression and

981
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:49,470
manipulation of electoral data so these

982
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,660
things do come back together in some

983
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,980
cases alright and I could we have a

984
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,899
question right over here and identify

985
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,010
yourself please thank you very much Mira

986
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,960

Institute and also organization which is

988
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,480
one of the proud sponsors of this event

989
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:05,020
the IRI has just conducted the opinion

990
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,530
polls thanks to the

991
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:11,200
of the NAD on the v4 and we were looking

992
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:12,430
into the how people I mean there are a

993
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,319
lot of global questions but one

994
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,910
questions are or one set of questions is

995
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,630
related to media and how people use

996
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:21,430
media and we have asked people we have

997
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:24,040
given them a list of media which are

998
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,080
normally bringing this information and

999
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,600
those who said that there are regularly

1000
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:32,020
or partially using these media outlets

1001
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:34,330
we ask them why and there was about 1/3

1002
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,830
to 1/2 of these people said that they

1003
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,319
are doing it because they find these

1004
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:40,600
media outlets funny and they like those

1005
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,760
those media and I'm just wondering if we

1006
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:45,700
are having it bearing in a consideration

1007
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,250
the change of the human nature thanks to

1008
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,750
the technology I mean in policies is

1009
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:53,170
that they are expecting instant

1010
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:55,720
solutions to political challenges and in

1011
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:58,060
terms of information I think this is or

1012
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:00,279
they probably expect more fun and

1013
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:03,850
amusement out of new so maybe that's a

1014
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:08,160
question for Jamie's how do you entice

1015
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:11,560
viewers readers back to the traditional

1016
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:14,020
trusted news organizations and I think

1017
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,660
it's especially difficult in countries

1018
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,670
like mine the United States where 14

1019
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,480
percent of Americans get their news from

1020
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:24,430
social media 14 percent and I think it's

1021
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,690
difficult also when you have a president

1022
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:30,509
that's constantly criticizing

1023
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:32,230
traditional trusted media sources

1024
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,990
thereby really leveling the playing

1025
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,700
field I think for faint news so I think

1026
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:40,509
you see a little bit of an uptick for

1027
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:42,640
traditional media when there's a hunger

1028
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,960
for the journalism that they do and I

1029
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,339
think you're seeing that now with the

1030
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,060
New York Times in the Washington Post

1031
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:51,340
and see it your old station CNN and

1032
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:54,520
others so I think that's part of it but

1033
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:56,140
I guess probably my longer-term shorter

1034
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,300
answers your question was will be that

1035
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,609
you don't this is a fundamental shift

1036
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,710
that's happening and people will

1037
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:06,070
continue to consume news on television

1038
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:08,140
and radio and newspaper but what about

1039
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,670
me more and more for generations because

1040
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,740
I think you were saying this the u.s.

1041
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,810
when you see the ads on American

1042
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:15,669
television networks they are for a lot

1043
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:17,830
of pharmaceuticals for ailments that you

1044
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:18,880
develop when you're over 50 you don't

1045
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,009
have a lot of 25

1046
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,230
so I think I told CBS News four separate

1047
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:25,990
for some demographics in the UK it's

1048
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:27,850
already the case that social media and

1049
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,379
particularly Facebook is the is the

1050
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:31,450
principle as you touched on the

1051
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:33,820
principle news platform and I think that

1052
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:36,220
does raise a lot of questions for us as

1053
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:39,370
an organization about how we make our

1054
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,529
material available which which we do on

1055
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:43,450
those platforms and it raises the kind

1056
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,940
of questions that we're discussing about

1057
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:48,210
what the responsibilities will be for

1058
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:51,940
those platforms themselves in the future

1059
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:53,740
anyone else so I just one quick word on

1060
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,690
something Gabriela mentioned that's

1061
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,629
relevant to this point on this notion of

1062
00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,610
it's not illegal to lie that's true but

1063
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:03,280
I'll invoke foreign minister link

1064
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:05,200
officious from Lithuania who says a lie

1065
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,330
is not an alternative point of view and

1066
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,540
I think this is something that we need

1067
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:11,440
to be mindful of in the context of

1068
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,540
journalism that's accountable and

1069
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,520
responsible because I don't think James

1070
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:17,110
has the ability to say I'm going to give

1071
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,509
you two sides of the story one is it

1072
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:21,100
evident live and here's something else

1073
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,570
to consider and find the space in the

1074
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,120
middle that's how propaganda works

1075
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:28,660
actually so I think this notion of how

1076
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,730
you ground the delivery of content in

1077
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:33,009
this environment where you don't have

1078
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,290
the sort of editorial scrutiny that was

1079
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,160
de rigueur when the New York Times in

1080
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,290
The Wall Street Journal in the

1081
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,790
Washington Post were the were the agenda

1082
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:41,500
setters not everybody was happy with

1083
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,360
that arrangement this is the world we

1084
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,910
live in today and so we can't go back

1085
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,710
but I think these questions need to be

1086
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:50,200
resolved because in the absence of them

1087
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:52,420
were confronted with people consuming

1088
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,339
news that is validated by trusted

1089
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,500
friends who they get the news from who

1090
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,720
looks very attractive it may be fun it

1091
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:01,510
may be silly but these are really

1092
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,419
serious issues now given where we are in

1093
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:06,160
so many countries in the established

1094
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,390
democracies thank you Chris I think we

1095
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,310
had a question down here in the front

1096
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:14,740
you've done down here in the front

1097
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:17,470
please thank you for chips whiskey vie

1098
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:20,229
cigarette inside let me just start with

1099
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:22,600
a short remark that's part of a fake

1100
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:25,330
news is something we all love and that

1101
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:27,759
is the onion news you know the older

1102
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:29,890
humor and maths that are widespread

1103
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,840
we shouldn't battle them what we're

1104
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:32,680
battling we're discussing is most most

1105
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,660
often the

1106
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,279
military or propaganda operations

1107
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,799
military operations that influence

1108
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,410
decision making and other democracies

1109
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,290
and a delight of course we have a 20

1110
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:47,500
century story of combating propaganda

1111
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:50,920
that was rightly pointed out this story

1112
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:53,170
brought up to the spotlight editors but

1113
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,890
today and this is these are my questions

1114
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:59,380
today there is no room for editors in

1115
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:01,960
the digital media platforms like

1116
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:04,809
Facebook all and so on or at least this

1117
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,510
role is being diminished do you see in

1118
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:10,150
the light of the bail in Germany that

1119
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:11,950
it's not against American companies

1120
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:16,420
it's against military operations by

1121
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:20,348
Russia do you see that companies will be

1122
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:23,440
pushed to introduce more algorithm or

1123
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:28,480
editors or experiment with artificial

1124
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,800
intelligence to somehow edit the content

1125
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,530
that that is put online

1126
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,359
what sort of interference to be is to be

1127
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:37,869
expected from the from the companies and

1128
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:41,558
second point the editors role was to

1129
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:43,960
provide the balanced the critical

1130
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:47,369
approach so we have we ensure that

1131
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:50,890
people actually meet two opposing point

1132
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:51,970
viewpoints instead instead we have a

1133
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:55,328
very often

1134
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:57,669
echo echo chamber in social media how

1135
00:46:55,329 --> 00:47:04,170
the technic tech companies may respond

1136
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:09,069
to the echo chamber thank you Jamie okay

1137
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:12,900
I'm our users don't want us to edit

1138
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:15,640
their posts our users let it be ordinary

1139
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,710
individuals citizens or let it be

1140
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,200
publishing houses who are using our

1141
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:23,710
platform to reach their audience

1142
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,808
we are not editing the content but what

1143
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,660
we see and I'm now coming back to the

1144
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:30,940
force news issue that false news in

1145
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:33,940
itself wouldn't be harmful

1146
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:36,220
it gets harmful when it is disseminated

1147
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:38,619
and what we see on Facebook when it

1148
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,899
comes to information operations and

1149
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:44,810
especially in pre-election period of

1150
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:48,110
times that there are a lot of em

1151
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:50,090
created fake accounts we call them fake

1152
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:53,930
amplifiers because they are amplifying

1153
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:56,270
the the message let it be false news let

1154
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:59,600
it be misinformation that's information

1155
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:02,450
or any other method these fake accounts

1156
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,549
can be created by both by machines or

1157
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:07,009
sometimes and what we see often in

1158
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:10,280
Facebook by humans they speak language

1159
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:12,920
they know the local political context we

1160
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:15,080
work very hard in the past months to

1161
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:17,360
tackle this issue and taking down fake

1162
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,270
accounts not only it's easier when it's

1163
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,640
automated it's much harder to tackle

1164
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:26,470
those which are human created we are

1165
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:29,180
using machine learning and human and

1166
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:30,830
mechanical systems to tackle them and as

1167
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,020
a result of that during the French

1168
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:34,730
elections we have removed 30,000

1169
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:36,710
accounts about it

1170
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,470
the other issue that what can we do on

1171
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:42,680
our platform with our users enabling

1172
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:45,529
them to be able to reach quality

1173
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,750
journalistic pieces and reading things

1174
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:49,880
that we find out maybe you should not

1175
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:52,130
read something that is entertaining you

1176
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,590
are funny or misleading without the

1177
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:56,720
source but read the other side as well

1178
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:58,550
read the perspective and that's it

1179
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,899
pretty that's something now that you do

1180
00:48:58,550 --> 00:49:02,990
right when you when you put the the

1181
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:05,120
little triangle saying you know disputed

1182
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:07,250
don't you you give some alternative

1183
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,319
that's as well and there's another one

1184
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:11,060
like the related articles that when

1185
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,310
someone is you is reading an article

1186
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:15,770
then we are popping up in the news feed

1187
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:18,020
other articles which are about the same

1188
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:20,410
topic but maybe giving different

1189
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:23,270
perspectives we have to be extremely

1190
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:26,359
sensitive here because people don't want

1191
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:28,670
us to tell them what they have to read

1192
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,520
we cannot guide them we can't download

1193
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:33,980
you shouldn't have fun I should never

1194
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,960
eat this piece it is a long journey and

1195
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:38,900
I'm pretty sure that we have to work

1196
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,420
together with the publishing houses they

1197
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,460
might as well have to change the way and

1198
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:47,060
adopt the way how they communicate how

1199
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:48,560
they write news in in this new times

1200
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,860
that's why we launched Facebook

1201
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:53,710
journalism project to find the trusted

1202
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:57,050
partnership that we might missing today

1203
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:58,550
and to enable that vie together can find

1204
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:01,040
a way how

1205
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:02,600
users can reach multiple perspectives

1206
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,100
and then make up their mind based on

1207
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,799
that multiple perspectives

1208
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,480
Marty did you want to chime in here just

1209
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,540
just to add I think you rated a non

1210
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,650
curated media are better together and

1211
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:16,160
they give different opportunities and

1212
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:18,440
they also if they also said different

1213
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:23,569
factors for how we how we how we want to

1214
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:26,420
consume information and I I don't think

1215
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:29,450
that a fully AI automated processes are

1216
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,550
anywhere on the horizon and I would be I

1217
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,529
would be very cautious and I think

1218
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,760
missing out on conceptual analysis when

1219
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:39,520
free expression comes into the

1220
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:42,050
discussion it's too much of a risk so

1221
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,940
this this wouldn't be going any third

1222
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:46,220
there and I think this is how we how we

1223
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,190
how we look at it at Google went back to

1224
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:51,020
the back to the back to the German bill

1225
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:54,890
I don't I don't think that this is aimed

1226
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:56,800
at war information as you'd like to call

1227
00:50:54,890 --> 00:51:00,799
it I think is a very short-sighted

1228
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:03,050
proposal for how to fix a purely

1229
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,770
political problem that is that is that

1230
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:08,300
is that is that is currently happening

1231
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:10,759
and there is there is a huge risk of a

1232
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,260
very Galatian that is not going to solve

1233
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:16,250
the problem of propaganda that is not

1234
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:19,130
only on my problem having a question I'm

1235
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:21,680
right make sure go ahead

1236
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:24,320
my name is Barry Lynn and I run the open

1237
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:28,970
markets program at the new America think

1238
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:30,260
tank in Washington and I wanted to sort

1239
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,080
of build off of something that James

1240
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:37,580
said earlier which is that one of the

1241
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:40,520
best ways to fight fake news is to

1242
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:42,819
ensure the robust health of trustworthy

1243
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:47,380
sources of news and information

1244
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:49,880
now last December will Lewis who is the

1245
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:51,440
publisher of Dow Jones which is the

1246
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,670
publisher of the Wall Street Journal

1247
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:58,580
he said that Google and Facebook are

1248
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:00,260
killing the news and he said that

1249
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:04,960
they're doing so because they're

1250
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:07,970
pinching stealing the ad revenue

1251
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,760
more recently Robert Thompson who is the

1252
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:15,270
CEO of News Corp said he wrote a

1253
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,980
ah pd0 said fake news this is the title

1254
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,590
of it fake news and the digital duopoly

1255
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:21,870
and then the subtitle Google and

1256
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:24,420
Facebook have created a dysfunctional

1257
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:28,109
and socially destructive information

1258
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:31,190
ecosystem and he went on to say Google's

1259
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:34,680
commodification of content knowingly

1260
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:36,840
willfully undermined Providence for

1261
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:40,500
profit what's your question

1262
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,240
so in short he's saying that the

1263
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,570
concentration of power by these two

1264
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,430
companies and the misuse of that power

1265
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:49,530
is a large part of the problem behind

1266
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,299
fake news so my question is to the

1267
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:54,270
representative from Facebook and the

1268
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:57,090
representative from Google how would you

1269
00:52:54,270 --> 00:53:00,600
how do you respond to these statements

1270
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:02,490
by will Lewis and Robert Thompson are

1271
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,430
you bringing down traditional journalism

1272
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:07,620
stealing its relatives traditional

1273
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,750
journalism is changing and it has

1274
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:14,130
started to change before Facebook

1275
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:16,020
existed naturally our platform has

1276
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,450
changed significantly the way how people

1277
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:22,380
consume news and how people consume

1278
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:25,169
information we touched upon this a very

1279
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:26,820
complex issue already and as I said now

1280
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,430
we launched the Facebook journalism

1281
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:31,220
project to find out the way what is the

1282
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:34,680
best way how we can work with the

1283
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:37,500
traditional publishers so that they can

1284
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:39,509
reach their audience or not platform but

1285
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,840
we as well have a responsibility for the

1286
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:44,400
news consumers our users on Facebook to

1287
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,320
make sure that they can share

1288
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,900
information with the people whom they

1289
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,580
want to share with so this is a very it

1290
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,340
is a complex issue it would exist

1291
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,650
without Facebook but we take our sharing

1292
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:58,920
that one and you take responsibility it

1293
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:01,470
is our own common interest for the sake

1294
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,110
of Democracies that we must have very

1295
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:05,790
strong media ecosystem and very strong

1296
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,830
publishing houses and very strong

1297
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:11,630
quality media journalism James is

1298
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:14,370
Facebook sapping revenue away from BBC

1299
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:15,810
by and large no and that's because we

1300
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:17,630
have a different business model for the

1301
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:21,360
one that you described so that we're

1302
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:23,390
we're license fee overwhelmingly license

1303
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,850
fee funded which just

1304
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:29,660
underscore a point is each individual in

1305
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:31,970
the UK who has who consumes any TV

1306
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,279
content has to have a license so that's

1307
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:37,100
a that's the level of Independence from

1308
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,260
government but nevertheless it's a

1309
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,110
guaranteed revenue stream so we're in a

1310
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:44,960
different place I think to some of these

1311
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:47,810
other companies that you you touch on

1312
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,660
there I think the the the terrain for us

1313
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:52,370
is much more about in a world in which

1314
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:54,740
we've previously been able to broadcast

1315
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:57,170
direct to our audiences that we're now

1316
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:00,649
we need to work in partnership with with

1317
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:02,810
companies that have access to to the

1318
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,640
consume of our these social media

1319
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:08,029
platforms and that's a whole nother type

1320
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:11,270
of issue of how do we continue to ensure

1321
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:13,250
that we get our content to consumers so

1322
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:16,220
I think we we've perhaps got a slightly

1323
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:18,770
different basket of issues to the ones

1324
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:22,009
that you described there it is slightly

1325
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:25,370
and be disruptive in responsive the

1326
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:27,590
question actually there's a way it may

1327
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:32,000
turn out that the this problem changes

1328
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:33,880
because the platforms that are currently

1329
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,140
setting the ad revenue may wind up

1330
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,080
themselves becoming victims of a similar

1331
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:41,480
phenomenon you've noticed that a number

1332
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:44,330
of companies now are refusing to sponsor

1333
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,390
particular shows or sites that they view

1334
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:51,910
as associated with extreme views I could

1335
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:55,910
imagine a circumstance where I have

1336
00:55:51,910 --> 00:56:00,140
advertised we refused to fund any kind

1337
00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:01,819
of platform that allowed its ads to

1338
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,339
appear on sites that are associated with

1339
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:07,730
extremists or racist or otherwise

1340
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,260
unpalatable views and that would quickly

1341
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,530
change the business model of the

1342
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:14,780
platforms because the whole theory is

1343
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:16,610
you're generating ad revenue and once

1344
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:18,140
the a revenue goes away you've either

1345
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,860
got to change your business model you go

1346
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,109
out of business

1347
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:22,970
and wasn't that how Google was effective

1348
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:25,220
in shutting down some of these up I

1349
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:27,290
don't know if you're aware of the small

1350
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:31,339
town in Macedonia that during the u.s.

1351
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:34,480
election had more than 100 Pro Donald

1352
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:37,280
Trump websites going and it was young

1353
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,980
enterprising Macedonian teenagers who

1354
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,619
are making tens of thousands of dollars

1355
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,210
in a couple month period where they I

1356
00:56:42,619 --> 00:56:45,829
think the average income there a month

1357
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:48,349
is about three hundred and fifty dollars

1358
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:52,280
just by putting creating this fake nose

1359
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:54,290
making money from the Adsense the Google

1360
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:56,780
Adsense that they'd signed up for so how

1361
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:58,400
did you find them and why didn't you

1362
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,470
crack down on them earlier though I must

1363
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,680
say because they did flourish during the

1364
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:05,359
campaign fifteen percent of everything

1365
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,740
that happens within Google search every

1366
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:09,170
days and you think to Google

1367
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:11,058
so sometimes we unfortunately need to

1368
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:13,190
experience something so that we can

1369
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:14,809
learn how to react to it and that's one

1370
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:17,170
of the examples of half we've learned

1371
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:20,960
about you a mechanism or a new attempt

1372
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:24,950
to sneak through the diligence while

1373
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:27,740
becoming our advertiser and we of course

1374
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:30,950
shut it down and now we have appropriate

1375
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:32,118
system how not to let that happen happen

1376
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:34,250
again

1377
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:36,800
and under on the journalism point I

1378
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,990
think the question that was that was

1379
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:41,480
asked from the audience has very strong

1380
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:43,520
paradigm on looking at news from the

1381
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,099
from the news industry perspective and I

1382
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:49,849
think if we put the consumer or Internet

1383
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:51,650
user first I think that Daily Mail has

1384
00:57:49,849 --> 00:57:53,809
done much more houses than has done a

1385
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:55,790
great and greater harm to the public

1386
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:59,089
debate than then unlike but first which

1387
00:57:55,790 --> 00:58:01,730
actually opened new channels for the for

1388
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:04,040
the debate likewise Facebook Google is

1389
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:06,740
also providing tools for journalists and

1390
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:08,509
and publishers we want digital news

1391
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:12,589
initiatives where we trying to discover

1392
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:14,900
new ways for publishers to grow their to

1393
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:16,970
grow their businesses but of course this

1394
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:20,210
is again only part of the solution and

1395
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:22,359
we just consume differently so so the

1396
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:24,980
question is like do we want to defend

1397
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:27,440
the industry as we've known that for

1398
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:30,260
years or do we want to see so you see

1399
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,250
new ways for quality content online all

1400
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,890
right and I think we have a question

1401
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:37,430
right here look this is I think to

1402
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:39,240
Michael John McCarthy I work part of the

1403
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:42,359
Mitsubishi group

1404
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,640
I'm from Australia look over the three

1405
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:48,090
themes are coming through to me here one

1406
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:50,310
is that there is a domestic problem in

1407
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:53,010
managing domestic news and that is

1408
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:55,980
Hillary Clinton sells weapons to Isis

1409
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:59,160
how do you deal with that a second one

1410
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:02,070
is you know the efforts that some

1411
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,109
countries go in terms of lying about

1412
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:07,560
their own societies and about their own

1413
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:09,540
policies that is not something you can

1414
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,820
do much about except not believe them

1415
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,380
but there is a third area which i think

1416
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,690
is very pertinent to some of the

1417
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:19,860
countries here less so to mine and that

1418
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:23,400
is where fake news is used essentially

1419
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:25,560
to destabilize societies it is in a

1420
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:28,470
sense a weapon of war that might be

1421
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:30,350
slightly exaggerating but the Russians

1422
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:32,790
you say very effectively in Ukraine

1423
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:34,740
that's that's certainly one case but

1424
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:38,700
there are other cases it's basically a

1425
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:40,290
destabilization exercise now even to

1426
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,140
some degree you might argue that that

1427
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:46,380
was the objective in the United States

1428
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:48,779
in the lead-up to the last election it

1429
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:53,550
seems to me there it moves from how you

1430
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:56,190
regulate news in your own country to how

1431
00:59:53,550 --> 01:00:00,240
you essentially protect yourself in a

1432
00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:02,400
security sense what would you see as the

1433
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,129
best approach for the United States if

1434
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:08,310
for example the examinations which are

1435
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:10,560
currently taking place of the Russian

1436
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:13,560
influence in the election were to come

1437
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:16,590
to a pretty gloomy conclusion how do you

1438
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:18,330
manage that thing as a society and of

1439
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:20,940
course that applies to other societies

1440
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:24,480
but perhaps in a less visible way is the

1441
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:27,000
case right now well you know I agree

1442
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:30,090
with you that I think in many cases the

1443
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,040
geopolitical actors are seeking to

1444
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:34,470
destabilize I don't think they really

1445
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,210
believe they're going to persuade people

1446
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:39,000
that you know for example Russia is

1447
01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:40,050
paradise but I think at some point where

1448
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,080
they're hoping is for many people

1449
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:45,450
there'll be so many different points of

1450
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:47,279
view and so many different quote facts

1451
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:48,509
that people will throw their hands up in

1452
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,240
the air and their attitude will be I'll

1453
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:52,790
believe what I want to believe so I

1454
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,890
agree that is a security

1455
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:57,800
threat but I come back to the point I

1456
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:59,629
made earlier I get very worried when the

1457
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:01,640
cure is to try to shut something down

1458
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:05,300
that we're actually creating a worse

1459
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:08,000
problem I think the reason you can

1460
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:11,150
destabilize a society is if it loses

1461
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,770
faith in its own institutions and I'm

1462
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:15,400
sad to say that I think a lot of the

1463
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:18,110
groundwork for what we now see is

1464
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,650
destabilizing efforts by geopolitical

1465
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,840
foes

1466
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:23,540
was laid within our own societies I mean

1467
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,600
over a period of time political parties

1468
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:29,660
have moved to a view that the way you

1469
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,920
win elections is by not just disagreeing

1470
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,350
with your opponent are arguing

1471
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,780
vigorously against his or her views but

1472
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:37,640
by actually saying you're bad if you

1473
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:39,830
don't agree with me if you're winning

1474
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,319
and spreading disinformation right and a

1475
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:47,660
classic example of this is a couple days

1476
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:50,120
ago a candidate for Congress beat up a

1477
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,250
reporter in front of other people and

1478
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,380
was until elected right did not really

1479
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:56,360
so elected now it may be in fairness

1480
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,040
that many votes had been cast before the

1481
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:01,130
incident but the point is his attitude

1482
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:03,290
was unapologetic he basically said well

1483
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:05,000
the guy was a liberal and and it

1484
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:07,790
startled I think we've come to the point

1485
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,160
that in internally generating societies

1486
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:12,830
is the idea that if someone disagrees

1487
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,290
with me I can beat them up so to me I

1488
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:17,299
think we have to spend I hope we spend

1489
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:20,090
time on this project thinking about how

1490
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:22,910
do you rebuild but the positive civic

1491
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:26,810
engagement in societies because in the

1492
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:29,600
best inoculation against destabilization

1493
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:32,480
is to be very stable if you're tottering

1494
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,400
from within then a push can be very

1495
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,740
dangerous

1496
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:40,610
James for being British which he also

1497
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:42,229
wasn't but yeah the other thing I wanted

1498
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:43,850
to add is just a particular thing of

1499
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:47,030
which I very much agree with what you

1500
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:49,580
said but then it extends to the

1501
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:52,070
denigration of those organizations that

1502
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:55,630
are practicing serious journalism it and

1503
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:59,870
when that when that decry dismissed as

1504
01:02:55,630 --> 01:03:01,799
lamestream media or fake news or you

1505
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:04,499
know operating out of

1506
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:07,319
agenda rather than a pursuit of of just

1507
01:03:04,499 --> 01:03:09,538
journalistic endeavor I think that is

1508
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:11,038
that is that is a particular example of

1509
01:03:09,539 --> 01:03:14,640
what you're describing which is that

1510
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:16,980
feeds back into a place where trust in

1511
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,569
the entrust in trusted sources becomes

1512
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:21,029
eroded and I think that that has become

1513
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:24,930
problematic Chris you had something to

1514
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:27,480
add so I think the the need for stronger

1515
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:29,730
journalism is clear but I think that

1516
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,049
that's really necessary but insufficient

1517
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:34,079
in this discussion because as the

1518
01:03:31,049 --> 01:03:35,519
questioner suggested the spectrum of

1519
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,740
threats that are faced and the

1520
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:41,308
information sphere range from an

1521
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:43,109
independent episodes of fake news to

1522
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:45,779
things that wouldn't reach the threshold

1523
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:48,569
of hate speech but nevertheless could be

1524
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:50,730
highly problematic introduced in a

1525
01:03:48,569 --> 01:03:53,220
systematic way in an automatic automatic

1526
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:57,690
way to active measures of the sort that

1527
01:03:53,220 --> 01:04:00,450
were applied in Crimea as far as we can

1528
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:02,970
see in Germany with the Lisa case where

1529
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:06,450
a whole host of instruments were applied

1530
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:10,078
ranging from fringe Russian websites to

1531
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:12,720
the major Russian TV channels then being

1532
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:15,660
validated and repeated by high Russian

1533
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:19,470
officials this was a Gong goes that were

1534
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:21,328
supported by Russia within Germany this

1535
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:22,859
was a concerted effort that seems to

1536
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:25,650
have backfired and I think in some ways

1537
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:28,140
the Germans are now more sensitized and

1538
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:30,660
aware of the of the threat but it's it's

1539
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:33,720
a much more comprehensive sort of

1540
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,940
challenge and I would wish for stronger

1541
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,859
journalism in the democracies with good

1542
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,989
investigative journalism but I think

1543
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:42,630
we're at the point now where we come

1544
01:04:39,989 --> 01:04:44,700
back to the question posed on how civil

1545
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:46,670
society can play a role there's much

1546
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:50,399
more of a need for both immediate and

1547
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:53,220
longer-term education initiatives not

1548
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:56,400
only at schools but for editors who have

1549
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:59,459
to sort through what is a real story and

1550
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:02,130
what's a fake story for media companies

1551
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:04,829
that are struggling this is a it's a

1552
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:07,619
massive massive challenge so I I would

1553
01:05:04,829 --> 01:05:08,730
just stress the the scope of the

1554
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:11,400
challenge and the need for a

1555
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:13,589
comprehensive response you know um on

1556
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:15,030
that point there are some young people

1557
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:16,920
here with us right now

1558
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:18,300
with a globe SEC young leaders for him

1559
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,970
and if we could get a microphone to them

1560
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,920
I believe you have perhaps some

1561
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:25,200
questions for our panel but also you

1562
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,500
they actually put out a paper they

1563
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:31,160
looked at this issue and education was

1564
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:34,350
one of the main points the need to

1565
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:37,640
increase media literacy critical

1566
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:39,750
thinking in perhaps our schools

1567
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,339
go right ahead introduce yourself please

1568
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,750
my name is Ken Vaughn and I lead the

1569
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:45,510
agency for public and social innovation

1570
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:47,630
in Canada I'll be asking a question and

1571
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:50,070
someone else will be giving position um

1572
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:52,380
my question well actually earlier

1573
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:57,300
Gabrielle you spoke about how Facebook

1574
01:05:52,380 --> 01:06:00,420
doesn't edit a user's content fair but

1575
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,890
you do curate our news feeds and at the

1576
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:05,940
beginning secretary Chertoff you talked

1577
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:08,520
about how curation impacts and enhances

1578
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,960
the potency of faith' news and shortly

1579
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,600
after Rachel you then spoke to James

1580
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,000
about how you know there are rules that

1581
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:17,069
media has to adhere to but given the

1582
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,160
role that Google and Facebook plays and

1583
01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:22,680
your algorithms in curating content are

1584
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:30,149
you not a media outlet or where do you

1585
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:32,190
draw that line but newsfeed curating the

1586
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:33,990
newsfeed doesn't mean editing the

1587
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:36,120
content we do not make a decision

1588
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,830
whether you can post something or not

1589
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:39,859
you can post everything on facebook we

1590
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:43,860
only remove that is against our rules

1591
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:45,960
the news feed all like per day you would

1592
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:47,760
have about thousand posts to read

1593
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,890
we know our users don't have time for

1594
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,300
that and when you log into Facebook

1595
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:53,400
let's say in the morning and most

1596
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:56,580
probably you will read ten pieces on

1597
01:06:53,400 --> 01:07:00,660
your newsfeed it's our task to make sure

1598
01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:02,910
that you get the top ten post for you

1599
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:05,339
that you find for yourself the most

1600
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:07,589
meaningful the most engaging and most

1601
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:10,020
relevant this is what we know that our

1602
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:12,330
users want from us they want engaging

1603
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:14,430
relevant and meaningful information for

1604
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:17,130
them the newsfeed is very unique to

1605
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:20,730
every person it's a personalized unique

1606
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:23,130
each of us at each moment in life we

1607
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:27,600
have the news fields but what you said

1608
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:28,740
is extremely important how we can make

1609
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,049
sure that

1610
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:36,359
fake news is not upgraded on the

1611
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:39,300
newsfeed but its downgraded we have the

1612
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:42,240
product that we launched or that is in a

1613
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:44,490
test phase now but we identified that

1614
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,310
users sometimes read the news then they

1615
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:49,439
do not interact with that for us that is

1616
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:51,930
one of the sign when we see that in

1617
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,460
scale that the users find by the time

1618
01:07:51,930 --> 01:07:55,890
that they clicked on a sensational

1619
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:58,140
headline they read the news and in fact

1620
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:59,879
that maybe this is fake something is

1621
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:02,310
smelling I'm not interacting with it I'm

1622
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,840
not liking it I'm not sharing it when we

1623
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:06,660
see that one that there's a lack of

1624
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:10,200
interesting in reacting with the piece

1625
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:12,839
of news then we are done grading that in

1626
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,009
our newsfeed and in another example for

1627
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:16,410
you that because it's extremely

1628
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:18,720
important what security charities well

1629
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:20,608
mentioned about the monetization about

1630
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,980
the financing cutting and curbing the

1631
01:08:20,609 --> 01:08:26,490
financial in financial incentives behind

1632
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:27,778
fake news in in the past months we've

1633
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:31,049
been reviewing more than hundred

1634
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:33,480
thousand news outlets or news outlets

1635
01:08:31,049 --> 01:08:36,569
but we tend to outlets that pretend to

1636
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:41,250
be news outlets outlets that have very

1637
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:43,710
bad quality content that made users buy

1638
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:46,290
ads buy promoted post to click click on

1639
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:48,420
themselves and then took out the users

1640
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:53,189
to their websites which turned out to be

1641
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:55,980
not news outlet but at farms and just

1642
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:59,278
tens of may we've been an imperial nuns

1643
01:08:55,979 --> 01:09:02,009
that we are cutting their financial

1644
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:04,470
sources we are making sure that non

1645
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:06,120
existing news outlets cannot use news

1646
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:08,310
domains that's one thing and the other

1647
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:10,439
thing is that we are not allowing as we

1648
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:13,790
are not allowing promoted posts coming

1649
01:09:10,439 --> 01:09:16,290
from such dubious and low-quality

1650
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:18,359
outlets let's call it like that so that

1651
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:20,220
we are done grading them as well in the

1652
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:21,750
news field so yes that's an extremely

1653
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:25,730
important issue didn't we have a

1654
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:25,729
question over here right there please

1655
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:30,240
thank you this was wonderful

1656
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:31,980
presentation I speak about Afghanistan

1657
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:34,318
the Twitter account the time I used to

1658
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:36,059
work for the government we had six seven

1659
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:38,310
Twitter account for the Taliban one for

1660
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:41,190
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so I had

1661
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:42,579
problem in Washington DC to feed the

1662
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:44,589
media especially

1663
01:09:42,578 --> 01:09:46,960
the journalists when their some stories

1664
01:09:44,589 --> 01:09:48,849
were breaking so they were quicker than

1665
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,799
me and then I had to in fact bigging

1666
01:09:48,849 --> 01:09:52,540
them that a it's midnight in Kabul I

1667
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:54,400
cannot check in fact with the president

1668
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:56,920
office or there so don't take that

1669
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:59,619
serious so then I didn't have that much

1670
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,989
time or education from our ministry side

1671
01:09:59,619 --> 01:10:04,119
that's nationwide in fact all the

1672
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:06,638
countries were supporting us that I'm so

1673
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:08,348
grateful they were not educating us in

1674
01:10:06,639 --> 01:10:11,139
fact about this technology but the enemy

1675
01:10:08,349 --> 01:10:14,530
they were more equipped and educated

1676
01:10:11,139 --> 01:10:17,079
than we and Washington so the same now I

1677
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:19,030
would say that this is not a gift of God

1678
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:20,769
human being that knowledge is power and

1679
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:22,570
that's the gift I should kiss the hand

1680
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:24,340
of each one of these guys Google

1681
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:26,049
Facebook Twitter you are doing the

1682
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:27,969
wonderful job I think the prophecies

1683
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:30,099
there in fact if you want in fact reach

1684
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:31,809
that is the wonderful platform you're

1685
01:10:30,099 --> 01:10:32,920
doing the wonderful job the problem is

1686
01:10:31,809 --> 01:10:34,869
we are not educated

1687
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,040
so what should we do what what do you

1688
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:37,808
think means that's a question that I'm

1689
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,889
saying that I agree with the gentleman's

1690
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:40,719
hate the last part which is

1691
01:10:38,889 --> 01:10:43,150
destabilizing factor that's very

1692
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:45,280
important that that is responsibility of

1693
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:47,860
each individual here on the planet that

1694
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:50,170
we your problem is my problem my problem

1695
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,820
is your problem so we cannot close eyes

1696
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:53,739
like some countries that they were

1697
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:55,829
tweeting in fact enemies in their

1698
01:10:53,739 --> 01:10:58,869
countries but they say I didn't see that

1699
01:10:55,829 --> 01:11:02,290
every post is my responsibility if I

1700
01:10:58,869 --> 01:11:04,239
feel that that is not understandable I

1701
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:06,219
need to in fact educate myself so I

1702
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:08,440
would say education I agree with fed

1703
01:11:06,219 --> 01:11:10,389
that education is very important but

1704
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:12,489
that cannot happen Google Twitter and

1705
01:11:10,389 --> 01:11:14,559
all the other they need in fact a kind

1706
01:11:12,489 --> 01:11:17,138
of platform not just waiting for in fact

1707
01:11:14,559 --> 01:11:19,059
for for people to tell them this is a

1708
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:21,520
fake news you need to educate yourself

1709
01:11:19,059 --> 01:11:22,980
or the law enforcement that exactly what

1710
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,750
is fake news what is making

1711
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:27,428
destabilization what is in fact

1712
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:30,219
terrorizing some or for example last

1713
01:11:27,429 --> 01:11:32,050
work the tweet in fact the operation in

1714
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,940
fact my Pentagon friends are agreeing

1715
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:36,250
with me that we had in fact operations

1716
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:38,650
in Afghanistan that some guys were

1717
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:40,630
tweeting from the local community and

1718
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:41,980
sharing the pictures and the Twitter or

1719
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,590
the Facebook account they were not

1720
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:47,619
informed that this is seriously causing

1721
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:49,540
a casualties on a platform well that's

1722
01:11:47,619 --> 01:11:50,889
funny actually let me take that point

1723
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:52,659
you brought up a very good point that

1724
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:54,639
I'd wanted to address with a secretary

1725
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:55,990
Chertoff I don't know if anyone here is

1726
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:57,520
read the latest

1727
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:59,620
edition of Time magazine they have a

1728
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,240
very very interesting investigation on

1729
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:03,460
the topic we're discussing today

1730
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:06,910
and what they discovered was that in

1731
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:10,690
March that Russians Russia used malware

1732
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:12,519
to try to hack into the phones the

1733
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:16,690
computers and the Twitter accounts of

1734
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:18,420
some 10,000 plus Pentagon officials

1735
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:21,549
members of the US Department of Defense

1736
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:23,170
they were able to block a lot of it and

1737
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:24,820
I think they said at least in the

1738
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,930
article they took care of the devices

1739
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:29,080
that were compromised

1740
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:30,280
so our intelligence agencies in the

1741
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,590
United States are very worried because

1742
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,570
they're saying to what end was this

1743
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:36,550
occurring was it for something just like

1744
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:38,889
those two if there was some sort of

1745
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:41,590
security event if there was a terrorist

1746
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:43,840
attack a natural disaster suddenly would

1747
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:45,610
they try to activate all these fake

1748
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,170
Pentagon accounts take over the Pentagon

1749
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:49,059
accounts and start putting out

1750
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:52,990
misinformation incorrect information

1751
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:55,180
causing chaos what's your concern about

1752
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:56,950
I figured that's frightening that goes

1753
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:58,870
back to the issue I raised at the very

1754
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:01,450
beginning about actually interfering

1755
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:03,460
operationally by in the middle of a

1756
01:13:01,450 --> 01:13:05,380
crisis or an emergency sending out false

1757
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:07,810
information that actually winds up

1758
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:09,850
impeding what you have to do in in the

1759
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:11,320
physical world and I think it comes back

1760
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:13,330
to an area where I do think the

1761
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:15,910
platforms have a responsibility and that

1762
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:18,100
is unverified the authenticity of the

1763
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:21,430
people who are identifying themselves on

1764
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:24,760
it because in this instance you talk

1765
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:26,170
about impersonation and that is

1766
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:28,660
something which you don't have a First

1767
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:30,520
Amendment right to do so having some

1768
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:33,460
kind of strong authentication and

1769
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,960
honestly there are algorithms because I

1770
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:37,270
know you can do this with spam that were

1771
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:40,120
can detect a change in the pattern of

1772
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:42,670
what somebody puts on Facebook or on

1773
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,050
Twitter such that you would get a red

1774
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:45,370
flag that says there's something

1775
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:47,890
different here the person's behaving

1776
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:49,809
differently so I'd like to see you some

1777
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:52,450
of the tools that we use for

1778
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:54,970
relentlessly marketing stuff to people

1779
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:58,179
and turn it to the question of how do we

1780
01:13:54,970 --> 01:14:00,430
use behavior behavioral analytics to

1781
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:02,470
verify that the people using the account

1782
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:04,780
are who they say they are now speaking

1783
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:06,910
of behavioral analytics I wanted to

1784
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:09,639
address something that Facebook is doing

1785
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:10,059
again with the disputed triangle that

1786
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,160
you put

1787
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:14,890
saying this report has been disputed by

1788
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:16,960
PolitiFact or Snopes last year I

1789
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:18,610
moderated a panel on this issue here at

1790
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,350
globe sac as well and one of the

1791
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:22,299
panelists Walter

1792
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:24,310
Quatro GOG who is head of Italy's

1793
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:26,290
Laboratory of computational and social

1794
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:29,080
science at IMT Lucca they did a

1795
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:31,470
five-year study of Facebook and they

1796
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:34,860
examined what happens when you do

1797
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:37,630
dispute when you try to debunk a

1798
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:38,950
Facebook news post and what they found

1799
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:41,410
is that those people who initially

1800
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:43,780
believed it or even more inclined to

1801
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:45,730
believe it after you tried to debunk it

1802
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:48,610
so when you said this is big this is

1803
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:49,660
false it made them go well well there

1804
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:51,370
must be something to it because you're

1805
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:52,690
trying to downplay this so I'm going to

1806
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:55,420
believe this more they would like it

1807
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:58,240
more they would share it more so are you

1808
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:00,100
having any success with this new measure

1809
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:02,170
that you're trying and are you worried

1810
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:03,940
it could just backfire as I said I don't

1811
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:05,830
know yet whether we are on the right

1812
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,900
path or not because it's a test phase

1813
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:11,470
but these are exactly the very valid

1814
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:14,200
questions and just as we have been doing

1815
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:16,930
research when we've been rolling out our

1816
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:19,120
anti-bullying Center which is a totally

1817
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:20,920
different issue of IR raise it is that

1818
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:24,070
we've been working very closely there

1819
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:26,500
with the behavioral scientists academics

1820
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:28,900
who are looking into the online behavior

1821
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:31,180
of humans and as the secretary Chertoff

1822
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:33,700
said it is extremely important that we

1823
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:36,730
understand how humans how people how we

1824
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:39,700
interact online when we are consuming

1825
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:41,709
news so we are working together we've

1826
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,269
established the news integrity

1827
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:46,000
initiative and we are working together

1828
01:15:43,270 --> 01:15:49,600
with academics research organizations

1829
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:52,030
and NGOs it's a global partnership and I

1830
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,920
hope that many in the audience will join

1831
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:55,719
that and we have the opportunity to work

1832
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,240
together to understand better the

1833
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:00,220
phenomenons and the logic because if you

1834
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:02,490
understand better how people react when

1835
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:05,350
they see they offer four different

1836
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:06,940
alternative news we know that from

1837
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:10,000
experts who are dealing with online

1838
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:13,150
extremists some of these experts say

1839
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,980
that well when you hear something three

1840
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:17,830
times from different sources and maybe

1841
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:20,230
those some of those three are even

1842
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:21,930
opposing to the idea but the others are

1843
01:16:20,230 --> 01:16:25,259
totally trying to tell you

1844
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:27,240
you will start to believe it regardless

1845
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:29,580
what you are reading because it just

1846
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:32,389
fixated into your mind I don't know

1847
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:34,530
there's a thing allies bold often an

1848
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:36,840
omnipresent serious to that but

1849
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:39,870
certainly we have to understand much

1850
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,730
better how we are reacting and how how

1851
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:44,070
this fixation process goes on in our

1852
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:47,459
mind everyday news thank you didn't we

1853
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:50,670
have a question up here another one any

1854
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:54,900
more hands ok anyone ok maybe we'll run

1855
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:58,710
this side here thank you I have to be

1856
01:16:54,900 --> 01:17:00,269
very old-school here last year a book

1857
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:04,220
was pulled from Cambridge University

1858
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:06,660
Press because there was worried that

1859
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:08,730
libel they were worried about libel

1860
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:10,889
lawsuits because it was making

1861
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:12,740
allegations unfounded allegations about

1862
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:18,120
ill-gotten wealth by Russian oligarchs

1863
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:24,320
is there a role somewhere for liability

1864
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:29,640
or libel law in the publication or

1865
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:31,049
dissemination of laws and on the other

1866
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:34,590
hand is there also a danger of

1867
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:36,330
censorship of good information about say

1868
01:17:34,590 --> 01:17:39,540
for example the ill-gotten gains of

1869
01:17:36,330 --> 01:17:41,760
Russian oligarchs we'd like to Chris so

1870
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:44,400
the book you're alluding to I believe is

1871
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:46,200
karen dawisha as putin's kleptocracy and

1872
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:47,879
for all the views who couldn't find that

1873
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:49,740
through cambridge university press it

1874
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:52,830
was published and i would encourage you

1875
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:54,420
to take a look at it so that publishers

1876
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:56,760
are encouraged to do the right thing in

1877
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:59,280
the future i think one of the things

1878
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:01,560
that we've seen with the emergence of

1879
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,719
the internet is that certainly for

1880
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:06,900
british libel law libel has been

1881
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:12,260
globalized and so the threshold for well

1882
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:15,860
certainly for wealthy Gulf state

1883
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:18,420
potentates and for Russian and Ukrainian

1884
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:21,299
oligarchs they wield this like a big

1885
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:24,960
hammer and there's no question that it

1886
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:26,670
suppresses meaningful scrutiny or as

1887
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,880
meaningful scrutiny I should say there's

1888
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:31,200
still people who are very courageous who

1889
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:34,860
look into these sorts of things

1890
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:38,250
but it's a real problem and I think the

1891
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:41,000
the extent to which either reform of

1892
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:43,079
British libel law or other mechanisms to

1893
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,360
ameliorate this is very healthy because

1894
01:18:43,079 --> 01:18:49,230
in essence it's it's giving more space

1895
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:51,420
to kleptocrats to both steel in their

1896
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:53,879
home countries but in a globalized world

1897
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:57,179
they're just as likely to project this

1898
01:18:53,880 --> 01:19:00,239
maligned behavior into London and Miami

1899
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:02,790
in New York through ill-gotten real

1900
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:04,829
estate holdings and offshore accounts

1901
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:06,540
and all the things we're learning more

1902
01:19:04,829 --> 01:19:09,000
about with greater speed so it's a very

1903
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:10,920
important issue so we have about five

1904
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,630
minutes left and I have five panelists

1905
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:16,199
so how about each one of you taking one

1906
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:17,520
minute to UM summarize your thoughts or

1907
01:19:16,199 --> 01:19:19,379
share what you're most worried about

1908
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,560
what is keeping you up at night on this

1909
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:24,780
issue as we go forward my talk so I

1910
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:27,300
think that there are two ways to look at

1911
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:29,670
it one is what's going to happen in the

1912
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:32,610
news future as this debate is so hard

1913
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:33,869
that if you go to conference often I bet

1914
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,400
that the next one you're going to go to

1915
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:37,769
there's going to be at least one panel

1916
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:41,429
on fake news and and and how to tackle

1917
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:45,630
it there is a Warwick tendency to

1918
01:19:41,429 --> 01:19:48,510
provide regulation one that we discussed

1919
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:51,810
today proposed in Germany for for

1920
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:54,360
example and over-regulation now is the

1921
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:57,630
threat then we've got elections coming

1922
01:19:54,360 --> 01:20:02,250
up in Europe we've just gone through an

1923
01:19:57,630 --> 01:20:05,310
electoral cycle as well and so much so

1924
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:07,980
what keeps me awake at night in in short

1925
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:11,159
term perspective is unnecessary

1926
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:14,848
over-regulation and trying to trying to

1927
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:16,170
impose rules that are not going to solve

1928
01:20:14,849 --> 01:20:19,440
the problem but they're going to lead to

1929
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:21,170
is my more long term my Locsin fear and

1930
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:24,239
that's fragmentation of the internet

1931
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:30,060
taking content down is not going to do

1932
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:32,159
to solve real life problems and that's

1933
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:34,159
going to to that may lead to to a

1934
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:36,750
network of networks that may lead to

1935
01:20:34,159 --> 01:20:40,949
removing everything that we don't like

1936
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:42,840
or easily go do to two different natural

1937
01:20:40,949 --> 01:20:45,869
networks and there is a huge risk in

1938
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:48,119
that the risk is not knowing what's the

1939
01:20:45,869 --> 01:20:51,179
extent of many processes

1940
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:53,969
that are happening and that now the web

1941
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:56,070
is giving visibility to let's go to

1942
01:20:53,969 --> 01:20:58,229
Chris Chris and I wouldn't mind you when

1943
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:59,969
you and I spoke earlier we talked about

1944
01:20:58,229 --> 01:21:01,979
China because I know we've been focusing

1945
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:06,090
a lot on Russia here but they aren't the

1946
01:21:01,979 --> 01:21:08,519
only purveyors of fake news and

1947
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:10,439
misinformation disinformation it's it's

1948
01:21:08,519 --> 01:21:12,300
a little bit different but it's related

1949
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:14,699
in the sense that the Chinese

1950
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:17,550
authorities are investing billions of

1951
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:19,648
dollars in a wide range of media

1952
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:21,840
platforms both traditional media online

1953
01:21:19,649 --> 01:21:23,639
media we know from their domestic

1954
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,579
ambitions that they can use social media

1955
01:21:23,639 --> 01:21:29,969
to distract and direct their own vast

1956
01:21:26,579 --> 01:21:31,709
population in rather effective ways if

1957
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:34,349
you speak to people in Taiwan and Hong

1958
01:21:31,709 --> 01:21:36,419
Kong these days you can hear stories

1959
01:21:34,349 --> 01:21:38,510
it's very difficult to verify that these

1960
01:21:36,419 --> 01:21:40,979
techniques are bleeding into that area

1961
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:43,139
Chinese authorities are very effective

1962
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:45,209
at managing overseas Chinese and places

1963
01:21:43,139 --> 01:21:47,070
like Australia where China is taking

1964
01:21:45,209 --> 01:21:50,459
over much of the major media they're

1965
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:53,188
both english-language media but also for

1966
01:21:50,459 --> 01:21:54,688
consumers of Chinese language content so

1967
01:21:53,189 --> 01:21:56,669
is that your concern about this as we go

1968
01:21:54,689 --> 01:21:58,379
forward it absolutely should be a

1969
01:21:56,669 --> 01:22:00,929
concern I think Russia has been a more

1970
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:02,939
urgent concern and they tend to grab

1971
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:04,889
attention in all the ways we know but I

1972
01:22:02,939 --> 01:22:07,379
think what keeps me up at night in the

1973
01:22:04,889 --> 01:22:10,159
in the larger sense is that despite what

1974
01:22:07,379 --> 01:22:13,499
we know so far we're still not quite

1975
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:15,539
positioned and ready and mobilized to

1976
01:22:13,499 --> 01:22:17,309
deal with the full scope of the

1977
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:20,340
information challenges in the way we

1978
01:22:17,309 --> 01:22:21,689
should secretary Chertoff so you know

1979
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:23,489
for me I like to take the broadest view

1980
01:22:21,689 --> 01:22:25,379
of the topic which is how to defend

1981
01:22:23,489 --> 01:22:28,558
democracy and I think that one of the

1982
01:22:25,379 --> 01:22:31,829
reasons this fate news has traction is

1983
01:22:28,559 --> 01:22:33,449
because we have not reinvigorated our

1984
01:22:31,829 --> 01:22:36,119
commitment to democracy you know when I

1985
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:38,579
grew up as a kid there was a theory of

1986
01:22:36,119 --> 01:22:40,139
history that basically inevitably the

1987
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:42,780
world was going to progress to liberal

1988
01:22:40,139 --> 01:22:44,249
democracy everybody wanted that and I

1989
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,719
think that you were in a horse race now

1990
01:22:44,249 --> 01:22:49,129
I think if you look at other parts of

1991
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:51,149
the world there's a Chinese model about

1992
01:22:49,129 --> 01:22:52,769
you know the government doesn't matter

1993
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:54,389
if you elect your government their job

1994
01:22:52,769 --> 01:22:56,609
is to perform and as long as they can

1995
01:22:54,389 --> 01:22:58,859
produce economic growth and other

1996
01:22:56,609 --> 01:23:01,079
positive values that is a preferred form

1997
01:22:58,859 --> 01:23:01,889
of government Russia takes a view that

1998
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:04,349
it's about

1999
01:23:01,889 --> 01:23:07,460
nationalism and restoring the greatness

2000
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:11,400
of an empire extremist fundamentalists

2001
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:12,989
says God makes us legitimate so we have

2002
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:16,379
and we've got some health issues with

2003
01:23:12,989 --> 01:23:18,330
our own democracy and it's not really

2004
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:20,790
digital and one things I'd like to see

2005
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:23,159
is - and it requires it doesn't it's not

2006
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:25,320
about Facebook or Google or it's about

2007
01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:28,138
all of us and all of our institutions is

2008
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:31,320
to move away from tribalism we've now

2009
01:23:28,139 --> 01:23:32,580
gotten to the point that for a lot of

2010
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,469
people if you're from a different

2011
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:37,469
political party no matter what you say

2012
01:23:34,469 --> 01:23:39,750
or do I'm against you and I'm with my

2013
01:23:37,469 --> 01:23:41,639
guys no matter what now that is great if

2014
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:43,199
you're a Manchester United fan and

2015
01:23:41,639 --> 01:23:45,179
you're talking about football that

2016
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:48,388
should not be the attitude we take to

2017
01:23:45,179 --> 01:23:50,300
our politics and we've got to reset

2018
01:23:48,389 --> 01:23:54,119
ourselves in terms of our own commits

2019
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:57,810
Gabriela let's go on this path so I feel

2020
01:23:54,119 --> 01:24:01,080
that whatever we are in a situation now

2021
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:03,780
but our users experience as well when

2022
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:06,480
there are an authentic accounts and

2023
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:11,040
coming with the sensationalist or

2024
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:13,468
disruptive or violent and hateful images

2025
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:15,360
and posts and people than just saying in

2026
01:24:13,469 --> 01:24:17,909
those let's say Facebook groups oh I'm

2027
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:20,159
better I'm better leaving I'm better not

2028
01:24:17,909 --> 01:24:21,570
saying anything here so there's an

2029
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:23,000
intimidation but I feel that that

2030
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:26,610
intimidation doesn't only go on

2031
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,639
uncertain Facebook groups and in other

2032
01:24:26,610 --> 01:24:31,469
platforms but as well here in real life

2033
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:33,570
in this space as well where we are now

2034
01:24:31,469 --> 01:24:37,679
and if we let ourselves being

2035
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:40,799
intimidated and have trying to find the

2036
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:43,590
resort in in some easy fixes which are

2037
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,840
most probably not the right fixes then

2038
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:48,630
will be not only causing damage to our

2039
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:51,420
own societies and to our own European

2040
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:54,540
and transatlantic democracies but as

2041
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:57,440
well beyond because other countries in

2042
01:24:54,540 --> 01:25:00,119
in the world are looking as an example

2043
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:02,190
for this community so if we are not

2044
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:07,040
finding the right answers then we'll the

2045
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:09,780
damaging civilization and societies

2046
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:11,730
outside Europe and outside the stands of

2047
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:14,400
the land again go as well thank you

2048
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:15,200
James you get the last word I guess I

2049
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,540
have

2050
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:19,849
two thoughts final thoughts one is it

2051
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:23,300
sort of narrower one in and one is a

2052
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:26,300
broad one the narrow one is I I worry

2053
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:30,500
about being played and taken by one of

2054
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:31,730
these false news stories and you see you

2055
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,380
can either just make a straight error

2056
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:36,410
you think something's accurate when it's

2057
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:38,180
not or that all more insidiously that

2058
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:41,000
traction builds up around the story the

2059
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:43,010
disinformation process works it even if

2060
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,950
the entry point is is illegitimate it's

2061
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:49,130
it builds up into into something much

2062
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:50,780
bigger whether it's you know the famous

2063
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:52,550
example none of us have mentioned you

2064
01:25:50,780 --> 01:25:54,590
know Trump was the the Pope was

2065
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:56,720
supporting Trump but you know these

2066
01:25:54,590 --> 01:26:00,560
things can enter the bloodstream of

2067
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:03,350
mainstream news agendas even where the

2068
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:05,240
original starting point was was even if

2069
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:07,880
it's known to have been a sort of a fake

2070
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:10,150
new starting point and I guess my my

2071
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:12,170
broader concern is that the

2072
01:26:10,150 --> 01:26:14,830
organizations and the people who are

2073
01:26:12,170 --> 01:26:18,410
involved in the proper conduct of

2074
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:21,380
responsible public interest journalism

2075
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:23,570
are they lose traction they lose trust

2076
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:25,190
they lose access to their their

2077
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:28,070
readerships and their audiences and I

2078
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:30,320
think that's a that's a really worrying

2079
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:32,980
dimension as I said before I think it's

2080
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:36,049
it's a it's an element of the wider

2081
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:38,870
picture that Michael just raised as a

2082
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:41,090
sort of overall concern about the the

2083
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:43,070
times we're in thank you and I would

2084
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:46,100
like to end actually on a note of

2085
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:49,219
optimism with a quote by Buddha who said

2086
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:51,890
there are three things that cannot be

2087
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:55,490
long hidden the Sun the moon and the

2088
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:57,860
truth and I I think it's our duty to

2089
01:26:55,490 --> 01:27:00,889
keep pushing away the clouds of

2090
01:26:57,860 --> 01:27:03,799
disinformation so that the truth can

2091
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:05,180
shine and I want to I have a brief

2092
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:06,980
announcement here ladies and gentlemen

2093
