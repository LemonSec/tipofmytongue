1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:06,569
good afternoon everyone this is the

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:10,920
session called digital subversion and

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:19,430
digital restriction and I'll introduce

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:21,960
your panelists for the afternoon so oh

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:24,119
you guys did know you didn't okay how

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,000
did you switched on me to my immediately

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,698
left is John Felker who is director of

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,380
the national cybersecurity and

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,590
communications integration Center which

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,420
we know in the US and kick it's a

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,829
24-hour Center overseen by the

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,440
Department of Homeland Security that

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,200
analyzing coordinates response to

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,239
significant cyber threats next to him is

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
tell Moses the partner in ernst & young

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,980
he's been working in cybersecurity since

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,559
1989 and has founded several cyber

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,339
security companies next to him is Rado

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,078
Danyluk co-founder and CEO of tachyon to

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,480
start-up providing data center services

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,420
and device hardware and next to him is

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,640
Tony an skom global security evangelist

23
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,860
and industry partnerships ambassador for

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,890
ESET a cyber security firm based

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,630
actually here in Bratislava first of all

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,130
I just want to apologize for the red

27
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,869
blotch I've got here I had a little

28
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,580
accident at the train station yesterday

29
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:24,299
in Copenhagen but everything's fine and

30
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,720
we'll get going so our focus here today

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,060
is on critical infrastructure and what

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,000
nation-states and private industry could

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,939
and should be doing to secure critical

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,310
infrastructure and national security and

35
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:40,619
I want to just sort of sort of set the

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,869
tone for what we're talking about what

37
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,329
we're not talking about you know in 2007

38
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,700
there were cyber attacks in Estonia and

39
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,500
a lot of people have termed those in

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,729
some cases as critical infrastructure

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,259
attacks but they real weren't they

42
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,780
weren't really these were sort of

43
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,119
information kind of warfare influence

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,149
operations that are that upset

45
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,310
government systems and media systems the

46
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,520
DNC hacks the hacks against Hillary

47
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,489
Clinton and the DNC servers and even of

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,310
Emmanuel Mahone were not critical

49
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,959
infrastructure you know there's talk in

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,530
the u.s. of turning voting systems

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,910
actual

52
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,910
action systems into critical

53
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,680
infrastructure but the the systems

54
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:24,120
around there we don't generally

55
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,110
determine determine term as critical

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,490
infrastructure but we'll get into a

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,290
little more about what we do call it

58
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,790
critical infrastructure but I wanted to

59
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,459
talk about sort of attacks that we have

60
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:34,590
seen that have been against critical

61
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,880
infrastructure and these were attacks

62
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,959
when we're talking about text against

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,760
critical in structure we have three

64
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,620
different kinds you have a denial of

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,560
service attack that can take down a

66
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,810
production process or take down systems

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,730
you have destruction which can either be

68
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,410
data destruction such as wiping data

69
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,268
from a system or actually causing

70
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,370
physical destruction of the computers

71
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:57,330
themselves or of equipment that the

72
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:59,160
computer is control and we also have

73
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,650
something that we actually haven't seen

74
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,600
that much of yet and that is data

75
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,510
integrity attacks where you're actually

76
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,150
altering the data the code or something

77
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,799
in the system that alters that affects

78
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,660
the integrity of system so if you think

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,030
about let's say financial systems if

80
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,280
someone can get in and alter the

81
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,370
accounting software or get into the

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,220
stock system and change stocks or get

83
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,110
into weapons systems and change code so

84
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,670
that the weapon systems don't work so

85
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,590
that's something that sort of the future

86
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,798
fear that a lot of intelligence agencies

87
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,940
have now and that's something that we

88
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,769
will likely see so a couple of the

89
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,280
examples that we've seen so far are the

90
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:43,350
shim moon attack which targeted Saudi

91
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,090
Aramco assistance in 2012 in that case

92
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,420
it wiped data from about more than

93
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,040
30,000 systems and we've had of course

94
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,768
the Stuxnet attack which is an example

95
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,390
of critical infrastructure attack that

96
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,920
caused physical destruction of systems

97
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,958
controlled by digital systems and then

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,880
we had the this was a denial of service

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,040
attack which was the Ukraine power grid

100
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,190
hacks we had two examples of that in

101
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,260
2015 and then a repeat in 2016 just

102
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,410
affecting parts of the grid took out

103
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,039
about power to about 230,000 residents

104
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,450
between one and six hours so those are

105
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,810
the kinds of things we're looking at of

106
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,890
course the electric grid is the primary

107
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,650
critical infrastructure because it

108
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,789
undergirds every else every other

109
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,359
infrastructure so if you can take out

110
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:28,878
the critical

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,379
if you can take out the electric grid

112
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,349
over an extensive period of time days

113
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,389
weeks months which you could do if you

114
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:38,250
don't just take down the power but you

115
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:40,620
also destroy the equipment like the

116
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,360
generators there was a test of this in

117
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,099
the US if anyone is familiar with the

118
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,539
Aurora generator test where they were

119
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:50,340
able to destroy a generator in about

120
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:51,990
three minutes with 21 lines of code so

121
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,460
if you can take down obviously power for

122
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,039
extensive periods of times and of course

123
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,650
we're talking about affecting Commerce

124
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:00,360
we're talking about affecting hospitals

125
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:05,039
and eventually you know some kind of

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,699
death so a lot of things are hinging on

127
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,750
the the grid but the kinds of attack

128
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,919
that would take down a grade for

129
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,479
instance of period of time would not

130
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,219
need to be a very sophisticated attack

131
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,258
and you don't need to be sophisticated

132
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:18,029
to affect critical infrastructure in a

133
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,800
very harmful way and the wanna cry

134
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:21,180
attack of course is a prime example of

135
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,849
that there's been a lot of talk about

136
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,729
how badly that was executed and how

137
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:29,279
badly was coded and yet it was extremely

138
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:32,460
effective in taking down hospital

139
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:35,279
services critical services including

140
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,659
surgeries and for quite a while so you

141
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:41,099
don't need a nation state to attack

142
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:42,180
critical infrastructure when we're

143
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:43,319
talking about the threats there are a

144
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,669
lot of threats you could have insider

145
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,389
threats but what we're going to focus on

146
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:50,810
for the purposes of our talk today are

147
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:53,789
looking at sort of terror elements

148
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,159
terrorist elements warfare offensive

149
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:57,779
operations by nation states and

150
00:05:55,159 --> 00:06:02,099
hacktivism those kinds of attacks from

151
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:06,000
outside so I want to talk about first of

152
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:07,409
all defining what we mean by critical

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,139
infrastructure I think a lot of people

154
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:13,710
were surprised after the Sony attack in

155
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,449
2014 that the US government considered a

156
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,520
motion picture studio critical

157
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,979
infrastructure and in the u.s. we have

158
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,210
16 sectors of critical infrastructure if

159
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,620
you go through that list it's quite

160
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,198
extensive and it covers pretty much

161
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,729
everything and I know that not every

162
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,589
country it defines critical

163
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,599
infrastructure the same so I wanted to

164
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:33,150
throw this out to the panelists first of

165
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:37,050
all how are we defining critical

166
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:39,840
infrastructure yeah

167
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,550
this is tough I think the terminology of

168
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,888
critical infrastructure is a bit

169
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,080
confusing and and limiting the way we

170
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,400
think about it each country will define

171
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,849
it to be differently so there will be a

172
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,560
critical infrastructure like power grid

173
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:54,360
power plants and so on and secondary

174
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,440
critical infrastructure like banking

175
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,360
system hospitals and so on but I want to

176
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,550
take it into a bit of a wider definition

177
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,919
I don't know if you all agree with me or

178
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,810
disagree with me but as we're looking on

179
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,190
countries gun is not just borders or the

180
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,629
people living in eating critical

181
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,370
infrastructure is supposed to be any

182
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,069
infrastructure which is supporting the

183
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,560
living in the country and everything

184
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,849
that will be a disruption to this

185
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,669
infrastructure will disrupt the country

186
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:23,190
so the obvious example are the power

187
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,979
grid power plants hospital banking and

188
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,530
so on but what about our breakfast

189
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,990
cereal factory that could be attacked

190
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,638
potentially and let's say the iron

191
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,590
tables will be changed to make it a bit

192
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,150
poisonous is that a critical

193
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:38,669
infrastructure or not so I think it's a

194
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,460
lot of philosophical issues as well

195
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:44,490
what's critical and what's not in the

196
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,289
influence of this definition is who's

197
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,270
taking responsibility of protecting that

198
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,659
the government or the private sectors in

199
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:55,979
some cases that's my two cents regarding

200
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:58,800
CI yeah so I think I've just presented

201
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:02,909
actually this week at a GSMA event in

202
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,639
The Hague talking about IOT devices an

203
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:07,469
IOT most of us would think about being a

204
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,750
consumer you know the things around our

205
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:10,800
home but that's not what they're talking

206
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,379
about they're talking about the smart

207
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,810
city they're talking about everything

208
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,669
being connected you know the things that

209
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,699
are monitoring water levels the things

210
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,859
that are in our factory is that once we

211
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,930
once we get into a smart city then

212
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,389
actually the entire cities part of our

213
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,889
infrastructure and I'm not sure you can

214
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,599
actually start to make a definition of

215
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:33,390
this is part of our infrastructure and

216
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,399
this is not because if I can attack your

217
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,049
traffic network bring your city to a

218
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,390
standstill is that is that critical

219
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,939
infrastructure probably what about a

220
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,370
motion picture studio well you know I

221
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,480
saw your note we thought the before our

222
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,149
panel about

223
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,560
then actually broadcasters probably are

224
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,060
part of critical infrastructure because

225
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,430
it's a method for government to talk to

226
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,349
its citizens so maybe that's the

227
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:00,388
definition that would use their ID and I

228
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:04,949
Darrin I've specifically John oh butter

229
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:07,110
covers roughly you know the concept of

230
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:09,599
critical infrastructure is now being

231
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,209
extended you know for example we have

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,610
self-driving cars imagine that State or

233
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:17,369
non-state actor can cause mass casualty

234
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,980
so critical infrastructure now is

235
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:22,560
rapidly expanding and we over expanded

236
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,389
infrastructure will be very hard to

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,189
basically spend meaningful effort to

238
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:29,699
control it so we need to be careful to

239
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,740
really define is what we can handle not

240
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:34,349
overextended because we need a lot of

241
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,149
resources to handle it okay I kind of

242
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,889
agree with rather with it I think it's

243
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,290
too broad then it you know you really

244
00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:42,149
don't defend anything to tells point I

245
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,849
think it's a it may be a national

246
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,860
decision what's critical in your country

247
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,690
and how do you defend what's critical in

248
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,970
your country as opposed to trying to

249
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:55,079
defend everything all the time mm-hmm so

250
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:57,360
basically if everything is critical yeah

251
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:58,859
so let's talk then about who's

252
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,329
responsible of protecting critical

253
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,760
infrastructure is that the government is

254
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:04,410
an intelligence agencies who are more

255
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,240
likely to actually have sort of an

256
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,790
advanced view of threats that may be

257
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,319
coming down the pike and of course word

258
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,510
word we have to make a distinction

259
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,040
between privately owned critical

260
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,959
infrastructure and government owned

261
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,730
critical infrastructure so I mean the

262
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,209
case of government owned critical

263
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,980
critical infrastructure should it be a

264
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,138
civilian government should it be the

265
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,360
intelligence agencies who should have

266
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,370
the responsibility there I'm not sure

267
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,690
there's a difference between government

268
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,000
owned and privately owned critical

269
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,490
infrastructures all critical I think the

270
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,819
larger question is who's responsible for

271
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,440
defending that that infrastructure and

272
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:41,910
the way we operate and you've mentioned

273
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,610
a couple of different possible players

274
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,050
that are a part of that equation the at

275
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,120
the end of the day the asset owners

276
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,160
responsible for defending the network

277
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,410
but government the Telus community and

278
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,259
law enforcement all have a have a play

279
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,209
in supporting that defense

280
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:58,850
for example you know the there are a lot

281
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:01,488
of rural utilities in the United States

282
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:03,319
electricity for example and their IT guy

283
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:07,069
probably also serves as their financial

284
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:09,858
guy and probably the janitor right so

285
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:11,419
how how competent is that one person

286
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:14,779
going to be in defending that so so

287
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:17,209
those kinds of facilities need need the

288
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,410
intelligence and the information and

289
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:24,138
support to help do their defense better

290
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:26,079
so actually every piece of that

291
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:30,169
infrastructure has one responsibility

292
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,868
because government cannot guarantee or

293
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:34,429
cannot protect against vendor doing poor

294
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:37,160
job and living donor abilities

295
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:40,279
government can set the standards which

296
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,108
vendors has to adhere to so so the

297
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:43,869
government responsibility is defining

298
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:46,129
the policy defining the standards

299
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:48,049
vendors they have to meet the

300
00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:50,479
requirements to the standards and the

301
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:52,459
owner of the system they need to adhere

302
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:55,249
to standards of physical protection and

303
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:58,128
so every piece has own responsibility in

304
00:11:55,249 --> 00:12:01,129
component and but the standard setting

305
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:02,480
and the governance is really job of

306
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:04,039
development well are you talking about

307
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,899
voluntary standards are actually talking

308
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:12,049
about regulation see a lot of critical

309
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:15,079
national infrastructure it's hard to

310
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:17,629
rely on voluntary standards because they

311
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:21,169
are not met and how you guarantee

312
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:23,689
certain standard of safety relying only

313
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:25,970
on voluntary compliance so I believe

314
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:27,919
that role is really in standardization

315
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,309
body in government setting requirements

316
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:33,230
and policies if they are not set there

317
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,600
is no driving mechanisms for vendors to

318
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,439
complain and accomplish that level of

319
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,239
security so one of the problems with

320
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:45,049
standards of when governments issue

321
00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:48,409
standards is governments typically can't

322
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:50,600
keep pace and that's a challenge that's

323
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:52,399
a huge huge challenge because you've got

324
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,249
to go put it through a legislative

325
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,779
process and you've got to get it agreed

326
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:58,729
by industry and the rest of the

327
00:12:56,779 --> 00:13:00,589
government and it's it's tough for them

328
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:01,759
to do so I don't know whether there's

329
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:02,460
some other way

330
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,250
whether

331
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,320
a more flexible standard approach but it

332
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,880
would seem sensible for there to be you

333
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,220
know what one thing industry is good at

334
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,900
is actually finding innovative ideas for

335
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,210
protection or to do things differently

336
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,030
whereas if you have a written standard

337
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:23,310
and you corner industry into into a

338
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,839
certain way of doing it then you also

339
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,989
take out some of the innovation which is

340
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,900
not a good thing but you are relying in

341
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,400
that sense quite a lot on voluntary so a

342
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,110
lot of the problems that we have with

343
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,449
critical infrastructure are not

344
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,310
necessarily they are how with the owners

345
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,110
of the critical infrastructure but there

346
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,640
are deeper problems in terms of the

347
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,680
products and the software the hardware

348
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,630
the software and many of these and

349
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,329
particularly industrial control systems

350
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,800
that control power plants that control

351
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,900
chemical plants that even control

352
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,849
traffic lights they were never designed

353
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,459
with security in mind they were designed

354
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,470
twenty years ago and you can't slap

355
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,460
security on them really in order to

356
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,130
secure them you've got to re-architect

357
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,380
and redesign them so is there a role for

358
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,910
government because if the customers

359
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,140
aren't demanding security from the

360
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:10,920
vendors is there a role for government

361
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,480
to sort of set a minimum standard for

362
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,420
any security product and I'll just give

363
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,250
you an example medical devices we have

364
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:20,670
the Federal Drug Administration in the

365
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:22,410
u.s. that oversees the testing and

366
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,300
reliability of medical devices before

367
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,160
they can go on the record they never had

368
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,469
a security component to medical devices

369
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,189
until I think was last year after

370
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:34,200
researchers found a number of security

371
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,960
problems with pacemakers and drug

372
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,120
infusion pumps and diabetes insulin

373
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,710
pumps and things like that so is there a

374
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,360
role that government can play in

375
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,680
requiring certain products industrial

376
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,210
control system products if they're going

377
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,859
to go into critical infrastructure that

378
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,450
they have a higher level and maybe

379
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,700
that's a way of raising the security for

380
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:56,010
everyone if you get the product more

381
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,360
secure well you raise an interesting

382
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,950
point because it was an article this

383
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,960
morning in the news about medical

384
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,150
devices specifically about pacemakers

385
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,400
and to bring it back to what you just

386
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,610
said it difference between voluntary and

387
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,680
mandatory 49% of the medical companies

388
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,530
that will talk to by that survey said

389
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,849
they don't adhere to the standard set

390
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,520
I'm sorry they don't they don't add ear

391
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,070
to the

392
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,170
standards that were set by the the drug

393
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:22,300
agency so though that we have

394
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,459
manufacturers already admitting they

395
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,680
don't because it's a voluntary standard

396
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,660
so somewhere along the line you have to

397
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,069
make your mandatory standard at some

398
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,540
point you have to make that decision it

399
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,190
comes down to a risk decision

400
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,390
essentially and on the part of the

401
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:38,020
manufacturer I think it's a risk

402
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,610
decision it's based upon what are we

403
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,470
going to how are we going to profit from

404
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,620
making this piece of equipment or the

405
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,120
this set of code to to do what it's

406
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,330
supposed to do and where's the balance

407
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,460
between the prophet and the and the

408
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,770
security that you would build in and how

409
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:56,440
much risk are we willing to accept and

410
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:59,170
then the buyer also has to take a look

411
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,550
at all right if these are the standards

412
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,959
and I can prove that view that you've

413
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,939
met those standards that I'm willing to

414
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,550
accept that product but I think if you

415
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,380
if you don't then then I won't or I I

416
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,510
will hold you to them if I'm going to

417
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,939
buy your product I agree and I think the

418
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:14,860
government's place is to guide and to

419
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,140
help the critical infrastructure from

420
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,490
governmental and private sector to

421
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,650
comply with the certain level of

422
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,380
security but also agree with release

423
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:26,140
love that it's a shared responsibility

424
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:29,310
it's about time that private and

425
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:32,830
governmental sector sector with try

426
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,719
start to require warranty from vendors

427
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,570
from IT vendors security product vendors

428
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,020
for the product so if you sell an

429
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:43,900
anti-virus and I got hacked by a virus I

430
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:47,380
want you to be to give me warranty and

431
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:50,170
be responsible for that so once you

432
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:53,620
start sharing the responsibility start

433
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:59,170
raising the awareness for the risks so I

434
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:02,260
will go slightly slightly further today

435
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,089
concepts are basically reactive that is

436
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,189
full of the

437
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:09,329
you know of the potential

438
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:11,689
vulnerabilities and you know we are

439
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:14,480
trying to build defenses after the fact

440
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:18,949
you know the systems are not designed by

441
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:23,009
consent by construction technology and

442
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:26,789
exists to do that from capability based

443
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:29,220
system and so on and the issue or it is

444
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:32,549
there is no enough pressure currently to

445
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:35,299
build a system in a in more formal way

446
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:38,940
which has certain provable guarantees

447
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:42,149
technology and theory exist but there is

448
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:44,009
no pressure sufficient currently and the

449
00:17:42,149 --> 00:17:47,639
damage from vulnerability is not big

450
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:51,059
enough to basically go that different

451
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:54,110
part and I can see the role of the

452
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:56,759
government in the form of you know

453
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,498
supporting that coming from pushing on

454
00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:00,210
more University the technology to

455
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:02,779
incorporate that to the system because

456
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,190
UNIX came from the universities

457
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:07,860
sometimes for example government

458
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:11,070
directly improves the technology like be

459
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,080
a Linux or NSA invested money to improve

460
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:15,749
cross the border infrastructure and

461
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,820
start building stronger platform so I

462
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:22,830
believe that the government role will be

463
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:26,340
needed and more necessary to push new

464
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:29,129
methodology which commercial entities

465
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,449
are not deploying but still exist we

466
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:31,769
also know the government's move really

467
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,419
slowly though and you mentioned the

468
00:18:31,769 --> 00:18:35,100
standards and they can take in the US

469
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,350
for technological standards three or

470
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,549
five three to five years to have them go

471
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,428
through the approval process in the

472
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,168
commenting commenting period

473
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,850
what if we're talking about not critical

474
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:47,940
infrastructure like what were ordinarily

475
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,740
used to that are providing you know kind

476
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,240
of water services electric grid but if

477
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,279
we're talking about the internet itself

478
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,110
and the infrastructure that undergirds

479
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,389
the internet and communications

480
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:00,590
infrastructure we've had a number of

481
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:03,240
major and serious attacks

482
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,549
obviously the DynaTAC which was using

483
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,100
the Mirai botnet using surveillance

484
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,950
cameras to attack a Dyne corporation

485
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,689
which provides DNS services which

486
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,230
resolves where you go on the internet

487
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,100
and of course websites were inaccessible

488
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:21,120
we've had

489
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:23,580
bgp routing attacks where entire swath

490
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,559
of communication IP addresses are

491
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,409
basically just hijacked by someone and

492
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:31,320
sent to another location possibly copied

493
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,840
and then sent on to the location where

494
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,760
they should go the BGP problems have

495
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,699
been known for twenty years and they

496
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,770
haven't been fixed yet and it's required

497
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,020
you know it largely relies on the

498
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:46,020
telecoms agreeing to make the changes

499
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,860
that they need to make and ss7 which has

500
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,470
been in the news recently ss7 tax

501
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:57,059
believed to be happening in DC and other

502
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:58,679
areas ss7 is the protocol that it's part

503
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,740
of the telecom protocol a mobile product

504
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,650
protocol that allows a telecom if you're

505
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,990
here in bratislava but your phone

506
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,970
companies in london the phone company

507
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,770
here can tell the London company that

508
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,960
you're here and reroute your calls here

509
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,100
it's not secure and so someone can

510
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,380
actually if they know your phone number

511
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,000
and they have access to the ss7 protocol

512
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,520
and infrastructure they can route your

513
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,980
phone call to their system record it and

514
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,260
send it on to its location and it was

515
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,450
used by criminals recently believed to

516
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,559
be in Russia where they weren't looking

517
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,929
to get the phone calls but they were

518
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,639
getting the two factor authentication

519
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,130
text messages that were going to mobile

520
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,390
phones for banking accounts so they

521
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,280
already had the passwords through

522
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,750
phishing attacks and they needed the

523
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,168
two-factor authentication

524
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,340
text messages so these are critical

525
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:47,220
infrastructures the problems have been

526
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,590
known for years in some cases some

527
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,650
entities telecoms have taken some steps

528
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,439
not enough where where should the

529
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,580
pressure be for rewriting the protocols

530
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,320
I mean this is like starting from

531
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,120
scratch rewriting the protocols fixing

532
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,639
the protocols fixing the routers the

533
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:09,000
hardware who's responsible for that know

534
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,190
that the internet was not invented with

535
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,520
security by design nothing we're using

536
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:17,280
the Internet is secured as we said

537
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,480
before if everything is critical nothing

538
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,070
is critical we cannot say that

539
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,760
everything is critical and maybe it's

540
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:26,720
also the mean so stealing our second

541
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,280
factor authentication is got a business

542
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,269
goal behind that and not a terror attack

543
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,719
and it's not

544
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:36,389
going to disrupt the whole country and

545
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:39,149
that could be be a responsibility of the

546
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:41,820
business entity to enterprise while

547
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:45,359
we're talking about power grids or

548
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,979
communications to people not just for

549
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:51,029
going to Facebook that could be

550
00:21:46,979 --> 00:21:54,269
governmental as far as I know in most

551
00:21:51,029 --> 00:21:56,820
countries a lot of the security measures

552
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:59,549
that are in communication channels ISP

553
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,708
and on or being monitored by

554
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:04,349
governmental in order to see they have

555
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:06,149
the right security measured and they

556
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:07,889
have to comply with certain policies

557
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:10,439
that the government have dictated

558
00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:12,029
usually it's not enough or at least I

559
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,249
know that the government helps the

560
00:22:12,029 --> 00:22:15,749
operators want the being attacked so

561
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,849
there is the cooperation and there is

562
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:23,879
responsible arm shared responsibilities

563
00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:27,509
already going on actually you're an

564
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:30,859
interesting time where things will

565
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:34,469
change so most of the losses today both

566
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:35,609
economic losses you know we have denial

567
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:37,499
of service attack

568
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:41,309
you know incur certain number of dollar

569
00:22:37,499 --> 00:22:43,019
losses and let's define how much money

570
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,849
can be spent to improve the

571
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:46,739
infrastructure there is some economical

572
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:48,749
balance that's what's to today and

573
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:51,089
that's why we are kind of shaky

574
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:54,179
infrastructure but we need to realize

575
00:22:51,089 --> 00:22:56,940
that this IRT and proliferation IOT the

576
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,440
losses financial losses ten years down

577
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,950
the road will translate to actually

578
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,859
losses of real human life because it's

579
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,829
one thing getting computer down

580
00:23:04,859 --> 00:23:10,199
another thing is basically car in the

581
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:12,658
middle of the driving basically stop

582
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,429
supplying car stop actually working so

583
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:19,200
we need to very actively work where

584
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:21,450
economical balance how much I spend on

585
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,940
security versus how much I am losing

586
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,099
when they are security events that was

587
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,559
let's define the security level today

588
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:30,060
there'll be not sufficient ten years

589
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,210
down the road when IOT

590
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:36,360
relating to our life the answer to your

591
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:39,110
question about the ss7 is just what rato

592
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,360
said it's a balance right now between

593
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:44,490
how much it's going to cost to to start

594
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,320
from scratch and as you said and and

595
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:50,880
rebuild that protocol versus you know

596
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,790
what could we do to make it make it

597
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,400
better it it isn't an easy problem to

598
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,600
solve and what what about some of and I

599
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,740
want the audience to start thinking

600
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,770
about questions will coming to you

601
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:04,650
shortly what about you know the code

602
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,820
that is like the open source code that

603
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,790
has been problematic the heartbleed

604
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,629
vulnerability which was again and years

605
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,030
old

606
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,680
vulnerability and code it's open source

607
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,030
technically people can any1 can look at

608
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,290
it and find the vulnerabilities and no

609
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,300
one did

610
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,690
what about sort of some kind of

611
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:26,340
government private sector consortium

612
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:28,650
that funds a project that let's say

613
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,740
funds security researchers who will

614
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,390
examine code like that I mean is that

615
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,110
something that's worthwhile and even

616
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,000
something that could be done

617
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,500
internationally I said everyone relies

618
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
on that I absolutely think it's worth

619
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,830
considering that debts on the front end

620
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,720
already we've started in the United

621
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,980
States the cyber threat Alliance which

622
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,230
is looking at the threats which are on

623
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,140
the back end so I can see that as a

624
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:54,360
possibility is of a way to approach it

625
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,130
from the vulnerability perspective right

626
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,659
now it's there's a lot of security

627
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,270
researchers out there and we all know

628
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:03,300
they find vulnerabilities every day that

629
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,160
nobody knew before the the youngster in

630
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,730
the in the UK that found the kill switch

631
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,980
on wanna cry is a great example of that

632
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:14,070
so potentially putting together some

633
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,600
sort of consortium to look at things on

634
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:18,870
the front end might not be a bad idea

635
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,699
I mean software companies already do

636
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,139
this to a certain degree yeah I mean

637
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,510
yeah but but you have bug bounty

638
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,400
programs and we pay the researcher to to

639
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:29,010
come to us responsibly tell us about the

640
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,230
issue so we can fix it I just write I

641
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,340
just want to come back and point out one

642
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,240
other thing though when we're talking

643
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,860
about with these attacks on

644
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,800
infrastructure there's a comp there is a

645
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:40,649
common theme typically involves a person

646
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,149
there's always nearly always human

647
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,200
interaction whether it's an SMS message

648
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,179
somebody clicked

649
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,950
there is an email somebody opened

650
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,590
whether it's a USB Drive somebody put in

651
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:54,510
the machine I'm not sure I'm actually

652
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:56,668
not sure how you fix that piece and that

653
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,559
engagement with the end user very very

654
00:25:56,669 --> 00:26:02,429
human nature Tony I refer to those is

655
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,408
stupid user tricks they you know and

656
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:06,600
that's an inside trap because there are

657
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:08,940
people that do so many things but I you

658
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,289
know I think it's not I always feel like

659
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,940
it's unfair when you blame the user

660
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,408
because I'm a journalist and I get

661
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,029
contacted by people I don't know all the

662
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:17,010
time who are sending me things it's my

663
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:19,200
job to open attachments it's my job to

664
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,610
look at things from strangers and I

665
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,190
think it's a responsibility of the

666
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,250
makers of the software and my assistant

667
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:28,529
Ben to create configure a system that

668
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,200
secures me even when I do that even when

669
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,940
I need to do that so and also you know a

670
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,529
lot of those attacks are made to look

671
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,000
like they're coming from your boss you

672
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:37,289
know they're they they're really well

673
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,700
designed these days they don't have

674
00:26:37,289 --> 00:26:41,240
spelling errors and things like that I

675
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,399
try not to answer emails from my boss

676
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,460
good tactic um I want I just go to his

677
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:49,289
office and talk to him face ok adds

678
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:54,929
other questions since I want to go into

679
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:58,679
some ok hi Bert hello Kim it's Edward

680
00:26:54,929 --> 00:27:00,269
Lucas from The Economist um I obviously

681
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:02,399
know Magic Bullet to this we're going to

682
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:05,240
have to attack it from every direction

683
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:08,070
mixture of carrots and sticks and

684
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,899
regulatory pressure and education and so

685
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,879
on but not if you've mentioned

686
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:13,739
trustworthy software and I'm wondering

687
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,240
whether there's a and there's a very

688
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,289
interesting conference going on on Lang

689
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:21,149
sac at that at the moment which and I'm

690
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:26,490
wondering whether there's a role for the

691
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:30,000
state in setting our mandatory standards

692
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:32,580
for using trustworthy software which is

693
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,289
not much more expensive than the regular

694
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,330
software but on if it's critical

695
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:38,070
maybe we should be say you can't do a

696
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,049
self-driving car because of the

697
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,649
externalities that damage it can do to

698
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:43,590
other people

699
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:46,469
unless you have that I also wonder

700
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,519
whether you've mentioned the IOT whether

701
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,409
you're really saying we should be

702
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,120
pulling the emergency brake on the IOT

703
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:51,920
which just shouldn't be going until you

704
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,810
have you can

705
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,650
guarantee that at least the firmware on

706
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:59,960
these things is are remotely updatable

707
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:02,510
arm you're creating so many problems the

708
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,490
future both in terms of vulnerabilities

709
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,320
of the devices inside the home or

710
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,540
wherever but also in terms of becoming

711
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,300
part of botnets and so on that we should

712
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,649
be really game for some dramatic

713
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,159
dramatic stop or is that just

714
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:18,140
impractical can you slow the

715
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:20,360
proliferation of IOT I don't think we

716
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,010
can and I think at the end of the day it

717
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,260
comes down to making a risk decision

718
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:28,180
about how far we're willing to go I'm

719
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:30,650
not sure that the trustworthy software

720
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:33,770
is going to be pervasive because as you

721
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,540
say it's very expensive although again

722
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:40,700
it comes down to risk what am I willing

723
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:44,060
to accept I would point out that concept

724
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,780
of trust chain insecurity trustworthy

725
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,389
software

726
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:51,790
it's illusion of the sake of the safety

727
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:55,670
for tourism either state actors or

728
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:58,550
extreme ideology you know employee can

729
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,610
put into work into company which has

730
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:03,980
safety which has it is trusted yet they

731
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:07,090
can plant basically piece of the

732
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:11,240
software subverting the software so the

733
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:13,520
methodology of relying on the trust you

734
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:16,310
know because the so many people are

735
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,320
involved doesn't work very well and

736
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:23,050
let's look at practical example one of

737
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:25,730
the largest damage to us was done by

738
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:27,740
supposedly transported people people

739
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:30,380
within NSA people like Snowden which

740
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:34,790
have been cleared and trusted so the

741
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:37,700
concept of trust chain is as weak as the

742
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,409
weakest link and you know there are

743
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,080
hundred or thousand software companies

744
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:44,780
we cannot clear every software basically

745
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,899
person in that older chain of the

746
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:50,330
software infrastructure so I would

747
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:53,600
basically point out we need to move to a

748
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:57,080
system designs saved by construction and

749
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,449
that's where basically you know this is

750
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,470
underserved area which basically needs

751
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:06,130
more attention so instead being reactive

752
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:08,950
system is saved by design we shouldn't

753
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:12,100
we can't really stop the progress we

754
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:14,200
cannot stop biote from happening we

755
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,260
maybe we can explain the risk better but

756
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,940
we should never stop progress and look

757
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,280
at motorbikes people know the risk of

758
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,620
riding motorbikes but it's it's you get

759
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,760
quicker to work and you like right we

760
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,770
like the feeling of riding back you

761
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,629
won't stop even though you don't risk so

762
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,400
once people actually know there is

763
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,110
confusing IOT they can choose the order

764
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,330
to use it or not but you cannot stop the

765
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:37,330
progress that the security should never

766
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:40,960
be a disabler it's an enabler look at

767
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:43,240
the the car brakes what do they invited

768
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,720
the brakes in the cars they didn't

769
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,980
invade the brakes so you can stop they

770
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,990
invented the brake so you can actually

771
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,789
drive faster if you wouldn't have wrecks

772
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:53,500
you wouldn't drive and this is the same

773
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:58,090
should be with cybersecurity we should

774
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:01,570
allow this progress since the river also

775
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:04,389
the trust thing changes over time I mean

776
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,879
if we look at the the wanna cry issue

777
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:09,370
recently with the NHS my immediate

778
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,400
reaction was why the NHS still using XP

779
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:14,500
I mean it's a huge question and then

780
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,090
actually I spoke to a doctor in the NHS

781
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,360
I need to find out that their MRI

782
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:21,459
scanner uses XP and actually can't be

783
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,439
updated because they can't afford to buy

784
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,679
another MRI scanner now when they

785
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,740
purchased it was that trusted software

786
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:32,169
it probably was but as time moves on

787
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,929
what do you continually have to update

788
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:36,400
the trust well you know you have to go

789
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:38,049
even if you're going to get to that

790
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,030
level you have to go even on one level

791
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:41,559
lower than that and as the chips

792
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,770
where are our chips design where the

793
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:46,530
majority of our chips coming from China

794
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,908
and so you've got a trust issue there

795
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:53,399
with the manufacturing process where do

796
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:58,200
you stop you know there is no really

797
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:58,200
trusted source anywhere and yeah

798
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:09,400
sorry ah you're all using metaphors from

799
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,780
the world of consumer products to extend

800
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,250
that metaphor however I think you need

801
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,379
to remember the role that insurance

802
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,180
companies have played and no one's

803
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:18,370
mentioned that yes you can ride a

804
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:20,650
motorbike but if you do your rates go up

805
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,659
and if you're a private company and

806
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:24,910
you're reckless you can't get insurance

807
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,800
why not just make it an insurance issue

808
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:28,930
a private sector issue you want a cheap

809
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,820
up be cheap on security go ahead be

810
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,280
prepared for class action lawsuits that

811
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,980
put you out of business so there's a

812
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:40,510
huge debate about that now in in the

813
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:43,480
United States anyway the the insurance

814
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:45,580
companies have started to do those those

815
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,860
things that you described they don't

816
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,960
have the actuarial tables like they

817
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,340
would for life insurance or fire

818
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,020
insurance which go back hundreds of

819
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,399
years to make decisions but they've

820
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,830
stepped out and have started to make

821
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,560
decisions based upon a small amount of

822
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,060
data to to insure I think the bigger

823
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,240
question when it when it comes to

824
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,550
insurance and cyber is what's what's an

825
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,740
acceptable standard of security that has

826
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:11,020
got to be decided first you know it's

827
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:14,020
all over the map and it depends it

828
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:16,030
depends what sector you sit in so what's

829
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,740
the due care that you're going to hold

830
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,200
somebody to when they purchase an

831
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,410
insurance policy and how do you define

832
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,180
that due care and is it different from

833
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:28,390
and the electric grid as it might be a

834
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:30,490
Sony or with a healthcare manufacturer

835
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,310
it may be I don't know but I think

836
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:37,030
you're right I think that that that we

837
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:38,050
should have that discussion yeah I said

838
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,910
that you talked about the insurance

839
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,350
industry and so there are a lot of

840
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,850
different ways of coming at this and one

841
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,270
interesting example that we had recently

842
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:49,000
in the US was with the the medical

843
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:51,040
shorts talking shorting of the stock as

844
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,880
a company that had medical device waters

845
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,110
sorry

846
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,400
muddy waters yes so unsecured the system

847
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:59,080
and the researchers found

848
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,960
vulnerabilities and they decided to

849
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,090
short the stock

850
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,470
and because it was you know a lot of

851
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,760
companies are told about vulnerabilities

852
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,830
in their systems and they shrug their

853
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,050
shoulders and they'll say it's not a

854
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:12,389
real vulnerability it's a theoretical

855
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:13,889
vulnerability or we'll get to it when we

856
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,599
can and three years later the product is

857
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,060
still insecure and so they're going

858
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,830
after it you know in a different kind of

859
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,949
financial way there's there's some

860
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:25,799
debate about that though I mean the the

861
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:27,210
vulnerability became known should they

862
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,250
have followed the responsible disclosure

863
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:31,800
process to allow the company to make a

864
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,210
fix before they went public with it I'm

865
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,580
not sure that that was the case I think

866
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,949
they wanted to profit from it yes before

867
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,119
the there's a lot of context right there

868
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:46,020
yeah whether it be mothers really

869
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:47,429
effective yes um yeah hello my name is

870
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,040
kerstin pretty sober katana region

871
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:51,540
instituto international affairs l'm iíve

872
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,009
been to many conferences about

873
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,529
cybersecurity and usually the word that

874
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,650
pops up very early is resilience and I

875
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,000
haven't heard it yet and usually it's a

876
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,530
kind of magic word that nobody really

877
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,760
knows what means except we all know we

878
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:04,530
have to kind of bounce back and be a

879
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,470
back copper and running again bit faster

880
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:09,300
but I assume most of you agree that some

881
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,129
sort of resilience is part of the

882
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,510
solution I don't know if you want to

883
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,000
elaborate on that especially in the

884
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,130
context of IOT if that's really doable

885
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,770
leave it as a concept it basically had

886
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:24,540
to rethink well security requires liars

887
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,369
yeah and the analogy I would use is

888
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,890
actually you know I think somebody

889
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:31,440
talked about cars earlier on let's think

890
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:32,910
about a car you know back in nineteen

891
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,310
fifty something or other somebody

892
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,950
designed a three-point seatbelt then

893
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:39,390
somebody found that you could contract

894
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,330
the seatbelt into the floor then

895
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:44,910
somebody came up with a sensor and a

896
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:47,790
safety device we call it an airbag yeah

897
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:49,348
and now you have alternated safety

898
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:51,990
systems in cars that will stop before I

899
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:54,720
hit the other car the seatbelts still in

900
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:57,029
the car and that's the important of the

901
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,040
resilience isn't it is my seatbelt is

902
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,740
still there and my hair banks there and

903
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,619
I'm not going to hit the car in front

904
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:07,259
yeah so Security's mighty always has to

905
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,420
be deployed in layers I'm not sure how

906
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,940
that fits in an IOT world I don't think

907
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,320
anybody truly is at the moment because I

908
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,660
don't think anybody understands what

909
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,070
security should look

910
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:20,100
you're starting to see some standards

911
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:23,400
come out but yeah resilience is good

912
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:26,220
word I think you where you said is how

913
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,200
you define resilience we look at

914
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:30,149
resilience and etiquette as being able

915
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,549
to continue your business or your

916
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,520
mission and so there are a lot of parts

917
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:39,390
of that one part is security but other

918
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:43,110
parts are do we exercise our procedures

919
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:45,990
when when we have a bad day is the

920
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:48,360
leadership of our organization switched

921
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:51,000
on to that exercise and do they know

922
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,950
what to do if it's a really bad day just

923
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,080
recently in the wanna cry incident we

924
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:58,109
dealt with a health care facility

925
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:01,020
who first of all important understanding

926
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:03,750
our mission is asset response so it's

927
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,550
it's mitigation stop the bleeding and so

928
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,980
we were dealing with a hospital it was

929
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,750
very clear to us that that hospital had

930
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,730
done those things their leadership on

931
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,800
the problem the chairman of the hospital

932
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:17,310
knew exactly what to do and and knew

933
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,440
that this was an issue the the the rest

934
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,360
of the organization did all the right

935
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,360
things when this was sent in their in

936
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:27,090
their facility so they were able to

937
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:30,810
segment some of the MRIs that can't

938
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:33,270
possibly be protected away from the the

939
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:36,200
connections to the electric electronic

940
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:38,910
health records to make them usable again

941
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,700
they were able to segment other parts of

942
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:44,129
their facilities in rapid fashion as

943
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,660
this was going on so that they were able

944
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,340
to be resilient and able to continue

945
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,339
doing what the hospital had to do

946
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:57,089
significant shift which is starting but

947
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:00,420
it appears will be in full swing it

948
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:02,670
almost sounds like the lower causes

949
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,530
device more security needs it sound

950
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:07,140
completely counterintuitive but let me

951
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:09,540
make an example we have pcs we have

952
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:12,299
laptops there are thousand dollar

953
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,710
devices we can afford paying $30

954
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,070
antivirus and service

955
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:20,460
on that now if I have you know

956
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:22,800
intelligent microwave I cannot spend $30

957
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,710
of running antivirus on that it has to

958
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,680
just work TV has to just work so the

959
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:32,970
basically the the model economical model

960
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:36,919
and balance between money spent on on

961
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:39,870
basically securing system is basically

962
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:41,400
even more important in IOT because there

963
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:44,220
are lower cost devices the things which

964
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,930
work like antivirus we cannot afford on

965
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,000
intelligent by Bob which is one dollar

966
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,529
device we cannot run that so these

967
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,680
systems they have different requirements

968
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:54,600
and again is driven by economic balance

969
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,879
nothing else economy is the most

970
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,580
powerful force we need just need to

971
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,110
understand and harness that I want to go

972
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,029
back to what we started the discussion

973
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,530
with critical infrastructure and we're

974
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,900
talking about critical infrastructure

975
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:09,570
and IOT together and most of the

976
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:12,180
problems happens when you take out the

977
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:15,270
operational technology and move it into

978
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,490
IOT the water gauge is not used to exist

979
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,530
for 20 years some of them 12 years and

980
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:22,740
now to making new water gauges which has

981
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:25,260
an adapter to become more with better

982
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,299
connectivity but this is not where the

983
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,250
problem is yes it's not secured it's

984
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,350
easy to break but nobody can get to it

985
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:34,140
the problem starts when you make it into

986
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,450
IOT when you can control it remotely and

987
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,330
the good news are that we're still in

988
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,640
the transition of digitalizing critical

989
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:44,670
infrastructure if you go to the trains

990
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,790
railroads just now in most into the

991
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:49,620
world the becoming digital as you can

992
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:51,960
start controlling the railroad from a

993
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:55,470
computer and not manually like until a

994
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,660
few years ago if you can still now we

995
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:00,240
can still change it and secure it

996
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,250
because all we have to secure is the

997
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,850
digitalization and not the old

998
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:07,920
infrastructure so yeah and in many cases

999
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:11,130
I point out that the government in is

1000
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,240
pushing that digitalization free we had

1001
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,100
a problem for instance with smart meters

1002
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,140
in the US where the government

1003
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,720
subsidized they roll out of smart meters

1004
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:20,790
before they were tested for security and

1005
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,240
of course they can be remotely shut off

1006
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:25,790
to cause blackouts

1007
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:32,750
so when when you have initiatives that

1008
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:34,550
are under what's the I'm underpaying I

1009
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:37,339
mean when you're when you're subsidizing

1010
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,320
through government there has to be hand

1011
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:42,290
in hand without a responsibility to

1012
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:46,570
establish some kind of security model

1013
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:46,570
and standardization before your question

1014
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:55,670
my question is talking about antivirus

1015
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:59,540
and trust and IOT and if an IOT device

1016
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:01,760
or a chip is coming from China the some

1017
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,759
concerns there is now the company

1018
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,080
Kaspersky under review by the US

1019
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,869
government because there's some issues

1020
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:11,270
with just my question is gentleman what

1021
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:14,630
measures do you recommend on a global

1022
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:16,490
level so we don't have to stop at a

1023
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,839
country level you know I'm sure there

1024
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:20,509
are some some great Chinese companies

1025
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:22,910
which could be trusted that completes

1026
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:25,160
which could not be trusted Russia as

1027
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:27,560
well so what measures should be

1028
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,899
implemented in in terms of auditing

1029
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:35,359
technologies and making sure they're

1030
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:38,030
really secure or not so you cannot

1031
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:41,720
really old it technology it's too

1032
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:43,760
expensive process it exposes IP and but

1033
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,529
I would point out you know China and

1034
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,990
Russia is kind of convenient basically

1035
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:52,730
supposedly bad guy but in reality

1036
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,229
majority of the problems did not

1037
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:58,000
originate in that country we did not

1038
00:41:54,230 --> 00:42:01,040
have recent outbreak because there was

1039
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,260
subverted chip from the China so we

1040
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,960
should really look where is the bulk of

1041
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,420
the problem coming is and not try to

1042
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,850
politicize and divert the resources in

1043
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:13,620
the areas where

1044
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,810
yes you know subversion of the chip is

1045
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,819
important if you have weapons and

1046
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:20,310
nuclear weapons and so on but we have to

1047
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:23,550
focus with the really biggest impact is

1048
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:25,440
and where the money is and you know we

1049
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:29,580
should be pragmatic rather than trying

1050
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,230
to politicize basically problem I agree

1051
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,330
most of the problems that we've seen

1052
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,820
from China or commercial problems of

1053
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:39,720
stealing intellectual properties versus

1054
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:42,690
attacking in order to get destructive

1055
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,790
but and now it's changed I believe the

1056
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,010
China have changed their plans now and

1057
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:48,840
they're acquiring intellectual property

1058
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:52,170
properties more than stealing them and

1059
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:55,650
they actually have a very clear plan of

1060
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:59,040
how take other markets in a commercial

1061
00:42:55,650 --> 00:43:00,570
way and I don't I don't think China is

1062
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,610
the threat agents that we need to deal

1063
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,320
with but I do agree that we cannot

1064
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:05,760
control where all the different parts

1065
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,040
are coming from if you're talking about

1066
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,400
common factor each car is being

1067
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,200
assembled from parts from all the 170

1068
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,270
different vendors who should take

1069
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,730
responsibility the vendors of the parts

1070
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,900
or the car manufacturer I agree it's a

1071
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,030
real question that we're still not

1072
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,010
facing and I think that we're talking

1073
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:24,660
about towards like there are two

1074
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:27,090
different words the physical wards and

1075
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,710
virtual wards but the question is are

1076
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:31,080
there the same world or two different

1077
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:34,230
worlds deal because the car is now part

1078
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,299
physical and pathological in this

1079
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,460
physical world we have clear rules clear

1080
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,290
responsibilities that aren't just just

1081
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,140
not that clear in the virtual world and

1082
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:44,910
it's a real question how if you unite us

1083
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,210
and responsibilities to share it the way

1084
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:50,129
it is now also I would little bit touch

1085
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:52,380
about China because we have a lot of

1086
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,060
things to learn from the China he talked

1087
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,490
about a lot about securing national

1088
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:58,529
infrastructure and communication and

1089
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:03,990
planning for that they are actually

1090
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:07,200
doing that in fact in 2016 they are all

1091
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:09,930
basically quantum based encryption

1092
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,640
Network for their military and the

1093
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:14,520
financial systems and they actually

1094
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,430
deployed it and we still need to do that

1095
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,560
so you know we should actually learn

1096
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,509
from each other and this is example when

1097
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,450
they did writing and we still have to

1098
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:26,970
follow it so you should work rather than

1099
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,649
you know trying to basically an

1100
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,859
antagonistic relationship we can each

1101
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:34,530
learn from each other and I think that's

1102
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:35,819
that's the way to go I just have a sort

1103
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:37,470
of jump in because we're talking about

1104
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,900
sort of adversarial Nations and the

1105
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:41,910
problems that they create and the vendor

1106
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,369
problems what about when we're talking

1107
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,810
about a nation-state itself that is and

1108
00:44:44,369 --> 00:44:47,310
we had a sample of this of course with

1109
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,369
controversial example with wanna cry

1110
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:53,549
where it use an exploit developed

1111
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:55,170
supposedly by the NSA involving a

1112
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,500
vulnerability that wasn't disclosed to

1113
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:00,450
Microsoft until a short time ago so held

1114
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,730
on by a government for years so and not

1115
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:04,348
just the u.s. I mean every country does

1116
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,270
this not every country but the major

1117
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:09,000
players intelligence agencies and

1118
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,849
governments stockpiling vulnerabilities

1119
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,760
rather than disclosing them so that they

1120
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:16,890
can be fixed and leaving millions of

1121
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,640
systems vulnerable how do we deal with

1122
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:22,470
that problem and either internally state

1123
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,299
by state internationally what's the

1124
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,129
solution here I think in order to answer

1125
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,770
these questions we need to put it a bit

1126
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:30,990
more accurately that Dennis a did not

1127
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,060
develop an exploit its founder

1128
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,339
vulnerability and anyone else could have

1129
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,869
found this permeability and as far as we

1130
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:38,520
know maybe someone else already Fonts

1131
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:41,010
vulnerability chernobly was an exploit

1132
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:43,320
excuse me eternal blue was an exploit

1133
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:45,119
you talked about wanna cry eternal blue

1134
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,680
was the exploit that wanna cry used to

1135
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,330
spread yeah but it's there it's a

1136
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,310
zero-day the vulnerability that was

1137
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,259
found in any expert kit could be

1138
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:55,320
developed and used once this

1139
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:58,650
vulnerability is known now um and the

1140
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,710
problem is once r0 the availability that

1141
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:03,900
is not known before is being discovered

1142
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:06,390
who should disclose it to the vendor how

1143
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:10,650
long and the kind of country actually

1144
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:13,049
keep it as a competitive Wolfer mean or

1145
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,040
not and i think this is the the question

1146
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:18,280
we're trying to ask you

1147
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,060
I'm sorry I think it's a it's a war we

1148
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,440
can never win

1149
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,900
you always have to fight we'll never win

1150
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,150
it's a chase we'll never be able to find

1151
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:28,110
all the loopholes or the zero days and

1152
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:31,960
there are entities which have different

1153
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:33,940
goals like financial goals in the

1154
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,410
darkness that sell zero day attacks -

1155
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,790
yeah but we're talking specifically

1156
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:38,680
about governments governments

1157
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,940
withholding them I'm not talking about

1158
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,740
you're never going to find out every

1159
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,050
vulnerability but when you do find them

1160
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,060
do you do you what is the responsibility

1161
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:48,880
to disclose it so everyone can be

1162
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,370
secured or to withhold it so that you

1163
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,480
can exploit it yourself so there we we

1164
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:57,670
have a very robust equities review

1165
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:02,590
process vulnerabilities expose all

1166
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:05,200
abilities at vep and it involves all

1167
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:07,990
different parts of the government and

1168
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,230
there are I mean just if you suggest

1169
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:13,180
that we should automatically give up a

1170
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:15,430
vulnerability and everything's going to

1171
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,970
be fine that's crazy I go to towels

1172
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:21,759
point you know the vulnerability existed

1173
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,589
it was located a tool was built to

1174
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,740
exploit it it could have been anyone

1175
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:29,200
anywhere anytime that did that in in the

1176
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,419
case of the US government that process

1177
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,980
will look at that look at each of those

1178
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,960
vulnerabilities that are discovered and

1179
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,330
make try to make a determination on the

1180
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,560
value of that from a from an

1181
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:42,310
intelligence and a national security

1182
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,670
perspective anyone else we're running

1183
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,650
out of time

1184
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:47,110
well I would just say as and sort as a

1185
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:48,370
software vendor I think I would like to

1186
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,690
think that the government would actually

1187
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:51,040
tell you if you if they found a

1188
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,680
vulnerability in yourself where it would

1189
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,620
seem responsible in the same way that if

1190
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,870
we saw somebody attacking a government

1191
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,250
institution the first thing we would do

1192
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:01,839
is actually content contact that

1193
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,700
institution and tell them they are under

1194
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,230
attack or they should prepare for attack

1195
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,720
and attack because we've seen that

1196
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:08,370
intelligence yeah the sharing should go

1197
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:10,359
both ways

1198
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:11,950
and there's a tremendous amount of

1199
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,200
sharing that occurs in the process I

1200
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:16,990
mean it's I mean if you if you take

1201
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:20,919
Recoleta its quote who's the recently

1202
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:23,520
retired deputy director of NSA 90-plus

1203
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,940
percent are disclosed

1204
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:30,810
in that process nothing moreover we've

1205
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:32,670
seen governments that actually enforce

1206
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:34,850
several vendors to lead back doors for

1207
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:37,560
them salted so they can use them later

1208
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:39,180
so it's not only about the disclosure of

1209
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,340
it it's about who can use those back

1210
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,859
toes right and who can hijack them if

1211
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,870
you do install one so we're out of time

1212
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,340
I want to thank the audience for your

1213
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:49,650
participation and I want to take thank
