1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
thank you very much thanks for sticking

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,859
around this afternoon it's wonderful to

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,960
have you

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,570
we're going to have I think a really

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,509
wide-ranging an important discussion on

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,089
the future of military technology and

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,609
specifically disruptors to the way we

8
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:19,650
think about military technology and you

9
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,010
can't ask for a more talented or

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,799
informed or better cultivated panel to

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,529
do that so joining me today to my

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,460
immediate left general Philip Breedlove

13
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:31,710
former NATO's supreme Allied commander

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,380
Europe next to him

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,850
Thomas chetowski the Undersecretary of

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,280
State for the Ministry of Defense of

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,110
Republic of Poland next to him retired

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,340
lieutenant general Howard Bromberg vice

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,489
president of strategy and business

20
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,340
development at Lockheed Martin Sarah

21
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,500
crêpes associate professor Department of

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,539
Government Cornell University and Franz

23
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,989
Stephan Gaddy associate editor of the

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,260
diplomat in New York so we're going to

25
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:01,858
be discussing today disruptive military

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,519
technologies near term midterm far term

27
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,920
but I I think that you can't have a

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,060
discussion about disruptive military

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,320
technology without addressing cyber as a

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,850
short term idea and especially from a

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,110
military perspective now we've got a lot

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,298
of speeches a lot of presentations at

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,220
this conference that deal with cyber but

34
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,229
we have it's a big theme of this

35
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,650
conference but I think we need to

36
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,720
address cyber enabled influence warfare

37
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,869
what I sometimes called weaponized

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,650
WikiLeaks from the very beginning

39
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,790
because you know we lose sight of the

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,270
fact that everything that the Kremlin

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:48,450
has done through the FSB and through the

42
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,570
GRU hacker squads through apt 2:8 and

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,610
apt through 2 9 through fancy bear and

44
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,969
cozy bear has been part of a military

45
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,820
operation with political dimensions so

46
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:02,309
it's not a transparency movement it's

47
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,539
not an open information movement which

48
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,640
is how some news outlets have

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,890
represented it it is a Kremlin backed

50
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,869
military operation aimed at

51
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,959
destabilizing Western alliances and the

52
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,800
proof of that is sitting to my left one

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,680
of their

54
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,300
military targets is is filip bread love

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,410
so who had his email hacked in july of

56
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,210
2015

57
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:29,609
by by the FSB by fancy bear actually GRU

58
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:32,670
by the GAO by fancy bear and leaked

59
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,050
online so you were getting hacked by the

60
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:40,799
Russians before it was cool

61
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:45,000
I wonder as a if you have a particular

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,570
on how we can combat that what needs to

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,950
happen now to stop that from happening

64
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,930
again so sure thanks first of all thanks

65
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,970
to the organizers for allowing us to be

66
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:00,030
here and having what I think is an

67
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,520
interesting discussion I've watched our

68
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,920
preparation by my panelists who are far

69
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,570
smarter than I and I think that we're

70
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,510
going to bring some interesting thoughts

71
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,579
to you today and that's very good the

72
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,250
introduction of starting with cyber I

73
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,470
think is a perfect place to begin the

74
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,650
conversation when I was first asked to

75
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,530
talk about this disruptive technology

76
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,090
piece I immediately decided to do what

77
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,770
people taught me when I dealt with the

78
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,920
press sometimes make the problem bigger

79
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,070
and think a little bit about what you

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,829
want to say and and I think of

81
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:37,620
disruptive technology I think more about

82
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:41,820
what are things that would be disruptive

83
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:44,400
that we could begin immediately what are

84
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,970
things that we might work on in the mid

85
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,820
term and then what are sort of long term

86
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:52,890
disruptive capabilities and as I sat

87
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,280
down to think about this cyber was

88
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:59,488
actually where I would start

89
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:02,160
both of the media for competition that

90
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,440
were mentioned in the introduction the

91
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,829
cyber piece and the information warfare

92
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:11,579
piece are being very disruptive on us

93
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:14,640
right now we are suffering disruptive

94
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,549
effects from cyber and the information

95
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,849
war and so how do we answer this

96
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,130
disruption and I come to the conclusion

97
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,800
and my panelists may add some other

98
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,200
thoughts that this disruption in the

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,380
shore

100
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:34,570
term it actually needs to be answered by

101
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:39,100
policy we in NATO have incredible cyber

102
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:42,430
capability but we in NATO do not have an

103
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:45,610
incredible cyber policy in fact our

104
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,030
policy is quite delimiting and it really

105
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,520
does not allow us to even consider

106
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,840
offensive operations as an alliance in

107
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,580
cyber and so a disruptive answer to

108
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,590
these cyber attacks might first be a

109
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,060
policy in NATO that would allow us to

110
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,150
return fire

111
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,790
to offensively take the fight to the

112
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,520
enemy which is what we in the military

113
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:15,310
want to do a fighter pilot like me we

114
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,250
always say that the best defense is a

115
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,590
good offense if you have a missile in

116
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,240
the air headed at your opponent he's not

117
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,060
worried about attacking you right now

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,090
he's worrying about surviving so I would

119
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,120
opine or I would offer that in the short

120
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:34,960
term for cyber it may be as simple as a

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,770
policy change to allow us to to be able

122
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,960
to return fire and attack and I think

123
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,930
that the paradigm in the short term also

124
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,419
matches extremely well for information

125
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,840
warfare I've been a bit vocal that we

126
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,590
have not taken the field in information

127
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
warfare

128
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,299
we are fighting because the enemy gets a

129
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,210
vote and the enemy is bringing

130
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,870
information warfare to us in all of our

131
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:05,919
capitals and to us as an alliance we

132
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:08,320
have elected again to act reactively and

133
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,050
defensively we are a boxer that has

134
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,870
entered the arena and decided not to

135
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,000
throw any punches only to try to defend

136
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,460
against the punches being thrown at us

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,050
so once again in the information sphere

138
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,930
I think that it's a we might have a

139
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:28,990
disruptive answer by just changing the

140
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:33,460
policy that we have such that we could

141
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:36,100
use our information capabilities to to

142
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,840
return fire to the enemy think about it

143
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,860
and I'll just refer to the United States

144
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,500
of America

145
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:45,270
right now think about the the capability

146
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,759
in Hollywood think about our ability our

147
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,740
ability to create messages and they

148
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:53,500
don't have to be false messages but

149
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:56,680
create messages to get to the world the

150
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,770
truth vice the world hearing over and

151
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,189
over very complicated versions of a lie

152
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,340
that is used to shape our thought so

153
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:08,560
those are my short-term thoughts

154
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,650
disruptive capabilities might be as

155
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,080
simple as changing policy and better

156
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,650
utilize utilizing tools that we already

157
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,878
have so when you take that question of a

158
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,948
NATO wide policy for offensive cyber

159
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,509
cyber operations when you take that to

160
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:28,419
Washington what sort of reception do you

161
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,180
get well what we it's not really

162
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:33,279
Washington that's the issue in this case

163
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,860
sometimes my capital is the most

164
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,770
challenging of the NATO capitals but in

165
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:42,520
this case it's not it's really about the

166
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,859
neck and our nation's each one being a

167
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:48,099
sovereign nation wanting to be involved

168
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,139
in messaging and being able to look at

169
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:52,690
messages in a very sovereign way and

170
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:56,020
that makes it very hard to work to

171
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:58,509
answer as a collectively at speed in the

172
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,520
information space or in the cyberspace

173
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:01,750
okay so that's the disruption that we're

174
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,779
living through right now when you look

175
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,650
ahead a little bit to the mid term

176
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:08,259
technological forces that are going to

177
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,849
shake the status quo of the way the

178
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:13,029
military does business what do you see

179
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:15,610
so I'm just going to frame I think mid

180
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:18,219
term and if you will allow me frame far

181
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,710
term a little bit because the panelists

182
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:23,199
have some great more specific things to

183
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,239
think about as a secured there were a

184
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,909
couple of things that really bothered me

185
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,610
and I think they are places where in the

186
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:33,279
mid term we can develop technology that

187
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,409
could change the face of the the threat

188
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,669
that we see out there and the first one

189
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:42,309
frankly is the a2/ad anti access area

190
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,310
denial threat the most prominent one to

191
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:48,069
us being in the Kaliningrad Oblast and

192
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:50,790
what we face there so what are the

193
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:54,810
technologies that allow us to redo

194
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,730
this capability if we attack a2/ad

195
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,030
straight ahead in a conventional way

196
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,160
like we have in the past it will take a

197
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:05,459
lot of sorties and a lot of precision

198
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,800
weapons to knock down the a2 ad which

199
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,640
will clearly influence our ability to

200
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,670
reinforce in a Baltic situation so what

201
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,330
are those technologies that will help us

202
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:20,729
to reduce the a2/ad threat quickly some

203
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:24,620
of those disruptive technologies I think

204
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:27,980
are already being worked on swarming

205
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:31,760
capabilities to overcome radar defenses

206
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:35,940
swarming decoys and swarming precise

207
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,640
precision long-range weaponry it's not

208
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,160
enough that we can swarm what would

209
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,310
enable that swarm is machine to machine

210
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,469
intelligence actions if one set of

211
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,959
decoys are already being targeted

212
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:52,260
don't keep sending decoys against that

213
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,950
specific site and divert the decoys to

214
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:58,110
another site so machine to machine I

215
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,920
don't think it's quite artificial

216
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,810
intelligence yet but machine to machine

217
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,770
conversation that allows our decoys and

218
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:10,739
those penetrating strike weapons to be

219
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:13,500
able to get to the target learn on their

220
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,840
way in understand who's being targeted

221
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,830
and who needs to be released to attack

222
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,410
and frankly since we have Prime's in

223
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:25,770
here who build things I would like to

224
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:28,709
challenge these to think about if we are

225
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,980
going to swarm we need to be able to buy

226
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,660
quantity so a disruptive technology is

227
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:39,750
developing long-range precision at a

228
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:42,689
price that allows us to buy in depth so

229
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:44,790
that we can swarm an attack so how do we

230
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,910
do those things so without all these

231
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,079
some of the other ideas to the panel so

232
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,370
that's kind of a midterm range that

233
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,380
we're thinking about a little bit when

234
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,080
you go out a little bit further the long

235
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,810
term 1020 years what are we not being

236
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,180
prepared for so I would challenge you to

237
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,880
the following remember the first time

238
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,469
that you saw Star Trek and they had

239
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,960
their little communicators

240
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,240
and you thought wow this is absolutely

241
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,400
incredible and you think about what

242
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,500
their little communicators did and it's

243
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,980
about 1/100 of what one of these would

244
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,050
do so I'm going to propose a few things

245
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,920
that you will laugh at and then I'll let

246
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:26,520
the panel again talk at other ideas but

247
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,770
I think in the long term we are going to

248
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,500
cross over a couple of boundaries that

249
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:37,410
we haven't crossed yet the first one in

250
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:40,860
the human genome gene editing developing

251
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:44,939
human beings who are weapons developing

252
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:48,000
the soldier gene edit I think is one of

253
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:51,630
those long term disruptive technologies

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,910
and then the second one is I think in

255
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,770
the future we are not going to ever

256
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,250
really think about a boundary between

257
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:02,490
our atmosphere and space again again you

258
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:05,910
may laugh I think maybe not me but my

259
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:09,600
son will see an x-wing fighter fighting

260
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:12,510
from Terra into space or fighting from

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,540
space into space think of the first

262
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,450
nation that reaches the ability to fly a

263
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,660
space plane up and take a satellite out

264
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:25,500
remove it physically or destroy it think

265
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:28,500
about the first nation that fights from

266
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,600
the moon and what kind of access that

267
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,830
they may have so I'm being provocative

268
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,990
but I think in the long term we have to

269
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,600
think about how amazed we were by the

270
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:43,440
communications devices and Star Wars and

271
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:48,120
now how simple they seem and I think

272
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,490
that we will see gene editing arranging

273
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,980
and building soldiers might be on the

274
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:55,470
future and I think that we will soon

275
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,550
forget that there's a boundary between

276
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:01,770
our earth and space and we will fight

277
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,560
through that medium so I'll I put those

278
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,300
out there as grenades yeah they'll go

279
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,310
off and we'll see what people have to

280
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,170
say right well as you can see this is

281
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,670
why the the occasion of this particular

282
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,680
panel is is so important right now

283
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,819
because technology moves so quickly that

284
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,729
some of the things that we identify

285
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,209
today is mid term or long term

286
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,249
disruptors are

287
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,628
kind of here in the present in one form

288
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:23,100
or another perhaps in a way that we

289
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,050
haven't fully accommodated for instance

290
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,269
I recently went down to Tampa saw

291
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,878
general Ray Thomas is the head of SOCOM

292
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,559
and he told me this story about a recent

293
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:33,540
encounter that some of his guys have he

294
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,219
said about five or six months ago it was

295
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,569
a day that the Iraqi effort almost came

296
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,029
to a screeching halt literally in the

297
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:40,559
span of 24 hours there were up to 70

298
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:42,240
drones in the air at one time and he's

299
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,529
not talking about allied drones he's

300
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,629
talking about little consumer

301
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:48,360
off-the-shelf drones that members of

302
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,579
Isis bought they jimmied with explosives

303
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,100
and they were hovering overhead and he

304
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,689
said at one time 12 killer bees if you

305
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,670
will right overhead this is what he's

306
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:59,309
talking about these little DJI phantom

307
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,959
drones that Isis had rigged were

308
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:02,399
floating over the head of the Special

309
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,859
Operations Forces working with the Iraqi

310
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,499
military in Mosul so that's a reality

311
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,990
sort of right now and I wonder Stephan

312
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:12,720
in thinking about what's the difference

313
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,089
between a disruptive technology that's a

314
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,889
military technology in just a military

315
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,990
technology this history give us any

316
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:22,259
sense of how to do that quickly and

317
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:25,670
easily thank you thank you very much

318
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:28,259
it's a great pleasure to be here I

319
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,639
actually would want in order to answer

320
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:33,720
the question I would like to move away

321
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:37,009
perhaps briefly from technology and that

322
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:41,249
is I think what makes an effective

323
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:44,939
disruptive military technology is when

324
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:47,189
it is applied with the right tactics and

325
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:49,259
the right operational concept and I

326
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:52,490
think that sometimes that gets forgotten

327
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:57,839
when we talk about disruptive military

328
00:14:52,490 --> 00:15:02,429
technologies if you look at historical

329
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,619
examples you can basically divide up the

330
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:08,850
impact of disruptive military

331
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:11,069
technologies into three phases there's

332
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,619
usually and what I would call and what

333
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,089
some other scholars have called an

334
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:17,309
embryonic phase where a new military

335
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:20,519
technology disruptive military

336
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:22,740
technology gets introduced and the

337
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,999
military being a slow-moving bureaucracy

338
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,399
and you know generally often not very

339
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,839
adapted adapting to your new environment

340
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,650
doesn't really know what to do with this

341
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,500
new technology

342
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:36,810
so they try out different things you

343
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,390
know and it usually fails to actually

344
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,550
disrupt existing war fighting methods to

345
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,100
think of the tank that was introduced in

346
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,650
the first world war in 1917 didn't

347
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,600
really have a decisive impact where

348
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:51,779
things get a little bit more interesting

349
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:56,670
is the next phase the so-called immature

350
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:59,250
phase where this disruptive military

351
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,740
technology gets more widely adapted by

352
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,300
different actors different militaries

353
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,300
and people are really thinking hard

354
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,949
about you know how to integrate this new

355
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,510
technology and how do you maybe

356
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,330
introduce new tactics or a new

357
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,189
operational concept and how you figure

358
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,440
out that you are in that phase is when

359
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:19,950
you are actually engaged in war you

360
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,430
achieve a decisive victory again should

361
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:26,100
think about the Second World War and the

362
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,589
German victories between 1939 and 1941

363
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,850
or think about the first goal for when

364
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:33,810
it comes to precision strike

365
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:36,959
capabilities a decisive victory and then

366
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:39,630
the next phase is the so-called mature

367
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:43,579
phase very disruptive military

368
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:46,890
technology is disseminated wide across

369
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:49,020
militaries across the world and everyone

370
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,140
is sort of copying whatever guaranteed

371
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,089
to success of the military that achieved

372
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:58,770
a decisive military victory in the

373
00:16:54,089 --> 00:17:01,920
previous phase here the example is I

374
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:04,530
mean the paradox here is that by

375
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,809
disseminating this new technology across

376
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:09,990
the board and copying tactics and

377
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,579
operational concept this new technology

378
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:14,670
then turns out to be not as disruptive

379
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,609
anymore so my argument would be actually

380
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,709
when we talk about a2/ad the general

381
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:22,260
mentioned I don't really see a lot of

382
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,189
these capabilities as they are today as

383
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,209
genuinely disruptive they could become

384
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:29,580
disruptive again when we you know

385
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,770
increased quantity for example some of

386
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,870
these weapons but I don't think that at

387
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,030
the end of the day for example precision

388
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,219
strike capabilities will have the

389
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,649
decisive impact in the outcome of

390
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,990
military conflict and I think the

391
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,390
historical example clearly shows that

392
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,860
when everyone has similar capabilities

393
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,330
of course you know the quality might be

394
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:51,510
different weapon systems might be

395
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,010
slightly different we are entering a new

396
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,020
phase of warfare it's really about

397
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,850
attrition rather than disrupting the

398
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,290
enemy with new tactics or technologies

399
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:01,110
and I think that's a face that you want

400
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:04,770
to avoid in the long run

401
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:06,929
okay so secretary chetowski in thinking

402
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,580
about how you handle or approach this

403
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,130
problem from a policy perspective I

404
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,919
understand that the government opponents

405
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:17,070
working through a strategy document that

406
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,660
outlines some of your approaches and I

407
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,860
think it's particularly relevant because

408
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,830
of course this is a government that's

409
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,199
right on the cusp of a huge adversarial

410
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,179
neighbor that's very adept at disruptive

411
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,350
tactics techniques and procedures so

412
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,940
that's a little bit about the strategy

413
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,879
that you're looking at thank you very

414
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,350
much for bringing the top and and I'm

415
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,300
really honored to be part of this

416
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,830
distinguished panel

417
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,629
indeed I thought it would be useful to

418
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:44,370
add some perspective from a non

419
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:45,810
first-year actor and for non first-year

420
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,459
actors I think destructive technologies

421
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,010
are indeed important because when you

422
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,830
look at technologies that are developed

423
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,350
in a linear way III think that the

424
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,510
obvious advice for a second-tier actor

425
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,810
would be not go for them first because

426
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:03,060
you know the and wait for the period of

427
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,010
maturation wait for the period where

428
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,360
those technologies become just cheaper

429
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,670
you know good enough is the principle

430
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,590
for for you but with disruptive

431
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,960
technologies that offer some extra

432
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,879
British added to accept performance or

433
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,490
through better cost-effectiveness in

434
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,340
this it did this becomes more

435
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,990
interesting for second-tier actors but

436
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,510
then defined by the operational

437
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,700
environment and which which brings me to

438
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,560
the to the to the paper with which we

439
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:32,070
have just launched a couple of days ago

440
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,470
this is a product of the unclassified

441
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,060
version of the product of the judging

442
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,420
the defence review that we have just

443
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:43,590
finished and which lasted around a year

444
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:47,130
and this review has focused on a

445
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:50,419
realistic analysis of the environment

446
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:54,420
and on the realistic analysis of the

447
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:56,340
resources and this brings us to a

448
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,430
conclusion that we have to I'm in

449
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,659
Poland we have to focus on

450
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:04,309
high-intensity scenarios in our vicinity

451
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,350
doesn't mean that Poland will cease to

452
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:08,720
become a valuable ally in other

453
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,870
contingencies we have been thinking of

454
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,020
how to make ourselves more valuable more

455
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,639
I mean contributing more in other

456
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,350
contingencies but it is important for us

457
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:23,030
and other allies that we become more

458
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:25,370
competent in defense of our territory or

459
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:28,420
in a defense of the of the vicinity that

460
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:32,389
brings me to the sort of operational

461
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,750
concept okay and can i yes yes sir thank

462
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,940
you

463
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,490
I too ad I mean I think that we are

464
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,590
first Ally that first of all

465
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,750
acknowledges as others that we will have

466
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,970
to act in the highly contested

467
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:46,760
environment a to ad environment but we

468
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,610
will also develop our own a2/ad complex

469
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:52,100
okay first of all mm to defend ourselves

470
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:54,979
and to create sanctuary for for the

471
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:57,889
Allied maneuver hyg is a concept based

472
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,840
on defense defense is a stronger way of

473
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,120
warfare as close if it's a put it

474
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,939
current development of technologies

475
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,520
favors the defense so we are thinking

476
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,750
along the lines of cost-effectiveness

477
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,929
simplicity as well so in on France's

478
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:15,980
sensor to shooter has to be simple we

479
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:18,410
are and in terms of domains we we are

480
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,330
naturally observing the development of

481
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,750
cyber and infant minds and we are

482
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:26,510
multiplying the investment there but we

483
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,210
also acknowledge that the war is to be

484
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:32,140
decided in a physical environment and

485
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:35,830
the high-intensity part of the spectrum

486
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:39,050
costs most money yesterday the dinner

487
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:41,389
was early French dubbed the term of the

488
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,220
analogue defense versus cyber defense

489
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:48,110
but city and all defense costs much more

490
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:51,980
and you cannot do it without it

491
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:53,240
so about two to two disruptive

492
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,720
technologies I already mentioned in

493
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,630
cyber end and an info domain when it did

494
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,550
when it comes to ultimate ation and

495
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,600
ultimate optimization for instance

496
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:07,970
drones we are we put more stress on

497
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,610
simpler and more I asked general

498
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,929
Breedlove

499
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:15,030
has mentioned so for instance there is

500
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:17,940
some question with regard to the current

501
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:19,799
strike role of drones and there are some

502
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,290
platforms that you know remotely piloted

503
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:24,600
that that you can use quite quite

504
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,520
effectively in Afghanistan or Iraq but

505
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,439
in a highly contested environment that

506
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,500
might be questionable so we are thinking

507
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:34,380
of either massive investment into is our

508
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,270
drones or kamikaze drones we are already

509
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,250
developed developing them and our turtle

510
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:40,290
defense units are going to be equipped

511
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,890
with such technologies similar to those

512
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:47,159
that ICC is using but probably more

513
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:49,650
personally developed lastly I think that

514
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,650
there is a great promise with day with

515
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:58,530
the whole aspect of directed-energy also

516
00:22:52,650 --> 00:23:00,419
for second two actors that that area may

517
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,370
render some of the defensive

518
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,900
technologies more effective for instance

519
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,699
grant based missile missile defense

520
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,299
might become much more cost effective

521
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,040
and lastly some of the aspects of

522
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:13,889
directed the energy might also allow us

523
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:17,879
to control better the escalation and

524
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:20,220
other forces versus actors that want to

525
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,309
harass us with the use of tactical

526
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,960
neutral right on phrase so miss Krebs

527
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,370
when we look at all of these different

528
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,790
things that go into the idea of a

529
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:31,320
disruptive technology I'm imagining a

530
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,879
policymaker sort of scratching his head

531
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,049
and going why I feel like I've got a

532
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,140
great handle on what's going to be

533
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:38,370
disruptive what do you think governments

534
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,950
around the world in particularly the US

535
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:42,090
government is missing when we talk about

536
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,690
what's going to disrupt the way

537
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:47,699
militaries do business so thank you for

538
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:49,830
being here and I appreciate being part

539
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:53,460
of this panel so as I was thinking about

540
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:57,480
the the theme of the panel I was doing

541
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,429
some preparation or procrastination by

542
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,049
watching the Google development

543
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:03,570
conference which happened last week and

544
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:06,600
Mark Zuckerberg a commencement address

545
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:08,250
at Harvard just a few days ago and so

546
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,290
these guys are both obviously or that

547
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,820
this company and this individual are at

548
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,070
the vanguard of what I think are very

549
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,600
sort of disruptive and cutting-edge

550
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,040
technologies and I thought well what can

551
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,840
we learn from what they're saying and

552
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,290
this development conference is amazing

553
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,820
because these ideas they

554
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,190
come out in this conference are really

555
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,500
what ones that I think at least from a

556
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,970
defense perspective we're always sort of

557
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,770
trying to emulate but it struck me that

558
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,380
there are four reasons why that's very

559
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,600
difficult to do and that there are these

560
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,160
cultural sort of a symmetries that that

561
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,139
are likely to create some at least

562
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,970
impediments to fully embracing and

563
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,210
implementing disruptive technologies and

564
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,650
the first one came out of the comment

565
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,690
that Mark Zuckerberg made in his

566
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,120
commencement address and he was

567
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,580
encouraging all these graduates to go

568
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,050
out and take whatever idea they have and

569
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,760
just run with it and they were going to

570
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,530
make it that he knew that people would

571
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:04,280
get mad from these ideas because good

572
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:06,350
ideas often run into friction and and so

573
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,780
I thought about the defense perspective

574
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,120
on this right so 90 percent of defend a

575
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,399
90 percent of technologies fail in

576
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,439
Silicon Valley I mean ninety percent you

577
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,440
cannot have a technology in the military

578
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,880
that fails ninety percent of the time I

579
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,240
mean people will be killed and so I

580
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,580
think the incentives and structure of

581
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,710
how Silicon Valley works versus how the

582
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,929
Defense Department works are just so

583
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:33,050
fundamentally different it reminded me

584
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,610
of a technology that was deployed at an

585
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:38,330
unmanned ground vehicle that was

586
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:41,629
deployed to Iraq in 2007 and it was sort

587
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:45,320
of automated it was meant to actually

588
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:48,020
kind of actually carry out lethal force

589
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,149
but there were some early indications

590
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,889
that it wasn't going exactly as it was

591
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,640
engineered and so they pulled it from

592
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,740
the field

593
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,650
yeah and the logic was that if you make

594
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,360
a mistake I mean you have fratricide you

595
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,780
have civilian casualties none of these

596
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,669
are things that are acceptable and were

597
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,370
helpful on the battlefield so that was

598
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:10,880
once or the failure issue another was

599
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,709
this issue of stovepipes which anyone

600
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,170
who's been in the military will be very

601
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:18,260
familiar with but so many of these

602
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:19,700
technologies that Google uses our open

603
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,190
source everything's open and it's the

604
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,960
sort of that the hive mind and I mean

605
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,900
Wikipedia is exactly this people

606
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,320
contribute this is exactly the opposite

607
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,930
of how the military functions ask if for

608
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,870
example is exactly meant to break people

609
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,789
apart

610
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,870
and separate them based on the need to

611
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:40,200
know yeah

612
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,120
and what we know of course in in office

613
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,860
spaces in Silicon Valley right now is

614
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,899
they're created sort of to facilitate

615
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,570
these coincidental interactions that can

616
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,640
facilitate new unexpected ideas that

617
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,080
can't happen in a when people are

618
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,900
divided by skin so that was sort of a

619
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,178
second thing the third has to do with

620
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,700
sort of hierarchy versus flatness and

621
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,770
and you know it's not to say that these

622
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,919
technologies firms in Silicon Valley are

623
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,389
entirely flat they're not but what but I

624
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,890
think there's certainly democratization

625
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:16,710
of ideas in Silicon Valley I was looking

626
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:20,279
up the list of Silicon Valley

627
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,990
billionaires and like thirty of them are

628
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,299
under the age of 30 I mean it's

629
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,029
ridiculous and so you know the the CEO

630
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:29,850
of Dropbox who's a multi billionaire

631
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:31,679
founded it when he was 24 yeah and it

632
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,469
reminded me of when I was a captain in

633
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,029
the Air Force and I wanted to do my PhD

634
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:38,070
and the colonel said well what am I

635
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:40,679
gonna do with a 28 year old captain with

636
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,408
a PhD like there's just a very different

637
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,760
mindset about how where good ideas can

638
00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:47,039
come from so that's the sort of

639
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,429
hierarchy versus flatness right and then

640
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:53,640
the last is sort of the the motives of a

641
00:27:50,429 --> 00:27:56,039
Defense Department versus industry right

642
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,710
industry wants to make they want to make

643
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,029
money frankly the government wants to

644
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,190
make sure they're protecting their

645
00:28:00,029 --> 00:28:05,100
people they're not for profit right um I

646
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:08,340
was visiting an automation lab at Duke

647
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:11,219
University last year and a lot of it is

648
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,139
like with drones and I was asking them

649
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,200
about how they envisioned the

650
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,580
deconfliction of airspace when you have

651
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,039
thousands or millions of civilian drones

652
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,990
and they said so who's working on this

653
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:24,149
and they say well nominally you're

654
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,279
technically NASA is but the real idea is

655
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:28,860
going to come from Amazon and the reason

656
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,570
is that Amazon has has has has skin in

657
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,158
the game financially to make this work

658
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,899
now Amazon won't implement it but

659
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,460
they'll come up with the idea pitch it

660
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:37,529
to the government this will all get

661
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,929
massaged and then will go off and do it

662
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:42,059
right I would almost argue that if not

663
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:45,200
Amazon then probably Google just because

664
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:49,580
Larry Page once a flying car real bad

665
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,740
like that and they also have an active

666
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,679
program in developing drones for

667
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,900
commercial delivery so one of those two

668
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,370
but it on this nexus between what

669
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,380
Silicon Valley is doing what Washington

670
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:03,560
is doing and what the adversary is doing

671
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:06,340
general Romberg where do you see the

672
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:09,500
most technological acceleration

673
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,240
happening where do you see the big

674
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,070
disruptor emerging between those those

675
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,480
three sites well thanks thanks for

676
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:16,550
having us again and thanks for the

677
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,220
panels this is really pretty pretty

678
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:21,800
interesting such a broad topic but it

679
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:25,390
comes to me we listen to all the

680
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:29,419
panelists it is all about denying our

681
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:31,310
ability to operate freely no matter what

682
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,950
space we're talking about whether it's

683
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,139
eighty eight eighty AD is in ground

684
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,930
space is it naval space is that air

685
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,580
space is a thought space is in our

686
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:43,520
ability to operate freely in our banking

687
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:46,760
systems it crosses every single aspect

688
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,910
of our ability to operate as we desire

689
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:51,950
to operate in our societies so when I

690
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,350
look at that I think the next great

691
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,030
technological advantage and as our

692
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,830
historian pointed out a lot of these are

693
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,149
not as great as they think right but

694
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,100
it's going to come from the intersection

695
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,720
of multiple ones okay it's not going to

696
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,760
be just one you're going to have to

697
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,120
combine these together in a way that you

698
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,470
can put them all together cyber and a

699
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,780
few other things but let's look at the

700
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,760
terms of non kinetic okay so then on

701
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,620
kinetic you have several areas you can

702
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,690
look at you can start with someone

703
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:22,699
mentioned lasers does everyone know this

704
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:24,530
term kinetic okay kinetic is killya so

705
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,830
we want to go non-kinetic right there

706
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:29,870
that to me is that area very broad it is

707
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:31,820
not just what we're thinking is that is

708
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,560
it just lasers lasers is a piece of that

709
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,330
clearly is a piece of that because

710
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,960
you'll have unlimited magazine depth or

711
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:41,389
unlimited ability with no resupply very

712
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,130
inexpensive it changes logistics it

713
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:46,370
changes the footprint it changes the

714
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,110
size of forces it does what you can do

715
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,120
as long as you can have precision so you

716
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,520
need precision in all of this so you'll

717
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,919
have non kinetics with lasers

718
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,039
additionally then you go after things

719
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,480
like and

720
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,519
the cyber piece that we talked about

721
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,620
yeah and you apply that wherever you

722
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:06,769
desire to apply it on the battlefield or

723
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,289
in the other spaces across across then

724
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:11,360
what about smaller ammunition that's

725
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:15,470
non-kinetic that's guided what about

726
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,439
anti vehicle specific munitions that is

727
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:20,269
again non-kinetic but designed to do one

728
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,620
shot one kill on one vehicle

729
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:26,269
what about anti-personnel non-kinetic

730
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,799
capability so again you can see we can

731
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:29,240
start branching this out but then how do

732
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:31,519
you bring it all back together that's

733
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,289
where the challenge is so industry one

734
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,940
thing that we're doing in industry I see

735
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:37,759
in all our industry partners is

736
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:40,460
innovation incubation having Innovation

737
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:42,049
Centers the ability to put people to

738
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,309
have that 90 percent failure rate that

739
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:45,139
was talked about so you can put these

740
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:46,279
ideas together yeah and then after you

741
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:48,080
put them together say okay what are the

742
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,179
challenges it's okay to fail in the

743
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,860
Innovation Lab yeah but then you can

744
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:53,600
make the decisions that you want to go

745
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,860
forward and then you have to bring it

746
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,870
back to see how you could put it all

747
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:00,740
together can you imagine it where you

748
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:03,258
have cyber lasers precision-guided small

749
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,820
weapons that are not Kinect kinetic put

750
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:07,370
all that together and then put it in a

751
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,928
very congested air space with multiple

752
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,008
drones we're going to manage that now

753
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,080
you're going to think about that so I

754
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:13,639
think if we could master the integration

755
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,769
of these different technologies that's

756
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:18,559
where we'll end up making the major

757
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:22,399
disruptive piece right so I think that

758
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,009
there's some barriers to the way the

759
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,199
West in particular can use disruptive

760
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:29,450
technology and those barriers stem from

761
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,610
the fact that we've got rules we've got

762
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,289
an international coalition that we've

763
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,209
got to you know stay together we've got

764
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,200
people that we have to be accountable to

765
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:37,820
we've got to be accountable to the

766
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,769
international media and the adversary

767
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,750
often doesn't have that even a state

768
00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:43,580
adversary like Russia will lie about

769
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,320
their activities non-state adversaries

770
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:48,759
don't have rules that's why they're

771
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,710
non-state so I wonder if there's a

772
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:54,139
disconnect between our ability to

773
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:56,629
leverage the disruptive technologies

774
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:59,990
that we create and the rules that we

775
00:32:56,629 --> 00:33:02,090
have to live by as a military in our

776
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,500
ability to use those so general

777
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,510
Breedlove you've add some experience

778
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,750
here do we have too many rules to be

779
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,530
disruptive well I think the civil answer

780
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,380
is No

781
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:14,810
we are a principled society we talk off

782
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,450
to the NATO and I can't speak for those

783
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:20,570
nations outside of NATO but we we talk

784
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,420
often in NATO about what defines us and

785
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:26,030
what keeps us together are our values so

786
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,460
we just can't toss the rules out the

787
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:31,910
window but I think we have to do is take

788
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,910
a mature view of how these disruptive

789
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:38,450
technologies might be used on us there

790
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:40,900
are portions of what we do as a military

791
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:44,960
force in NATO that need to remain

792
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:48,470
governed by our civilian leadership and

793
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,200
there are also portions however of the

794
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:54,290
fate the battle that we may face that I

795
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,250
think if you have to wait for an that

796
00:33:54,290 --> 00:34:01,790
decision to respond you will be overcome

797
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:05,690
but you will suffer the consequences and

798
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:08,989
so I think the tough part of these is to

799
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:12,168
get together now and look at those

800
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:15,799
policies that we need to change in the

801
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:19,250
Wales and then Warsaw summit they begin

802
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,140
to do this when they read the thus a

803
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:24,710
cure to take certain actions on

804
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:27,139
generating and staging force that was

805
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,929
previously held by the neck but I think

806
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:34,040
that these these decisions that need to

807
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:36,679
be made prior to attack are the key

808
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:39,830
right now sitting down in thinking of

809
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:42,110
the disruptive capabilities that both

810
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:44,719
the state and non-state actors can bring

811
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,899
to bear on us deciding which are the

812
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:49,549
ones where we need to be able to allow

813
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:52,940
those who would respond either the

814
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:56,510
military or civil cyber or whoever has

815
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:58,910
the capability but enabling them so that

816
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,250
they can respond at speed I think that's

817
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,290
the secret sauce okay but just to recoup

818
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,480
I don't think we throw our values over

819
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,630
our shoulder yeah and just move out we

820
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,460
have to take a principled look

821
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,420
and those things that we need to be able

822
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:15,250
to act quickly on in order to avoid

823
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,190
catastrophe and then we need to enable

824
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,370
the forces that would respond to respond

825
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,900
at speed without having to wait for

826
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,130
decisions I want everybody to start

827
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,120
thinking about questions and as they

828
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,770
come to you raise your hand and we'll

829
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,440
get to them but can I try on something

830
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,880
for that yeah so so so you don't to that

831
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,030
point also I think that's where you have

832
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,680
to bring the policy innovators in at the

833
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,170
same time you're doing the technology

834
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,509
development because to me if you can put

835
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:42,610
the brainpower together earlier so as

836
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:45,130
we're developing technological advances

837
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:46,570
what about the advances in policy so you

838
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,910
can start looking at how you'd apply

839
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,290
these weapons as we're speaking about

840
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,390
weapons or how we do these other things

841
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:54,759
is it makes sense would we ever employ

842
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,440
it I mean what are those decisions that

843
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,330
you'd want to make as you're designing

844
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,610
because you'll design it differently for

845
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:02,350
command and control purposes and

846
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:05,620
decision processes if you use some of

847
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:07,060
that up front yeah yeah so I get go

848
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,700
ahead well I just want to bring up an

849
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:14,080
example of a discussion that is ongoing

850
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:17,799
now and that is as we begin to to feel

851
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,900
the capability of our European phased

852
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,870
adaptive approach and the aegis ashore

853
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:25,660
sites first in Romania and then in

854
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:28,900
Poland the capability to be able to

855
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:33,700
defend Europe will is really beginning

856
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:36,940
to become a reality what is not well

857
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,339
understood in our public's and frankly

858
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:41,800
among some of our political decision

859
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:44,170
makers is the speed of the decisions

860
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,790
that have to be made these missile shots

861
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:49,360
can be as short as four and a half

862
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:51,490
minutes yeah some of them the longest

863
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,370
would meet be eight and a half or nine

864
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:57,009
minutes tell me can you convene an AK

865
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:58,569
and decide what to do in four and a half

866
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,640
minutes or eight and half minutes can

867
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,620
you even call your capital and get

868
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,600
through it to a decision-maker in four

869
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,509
and a half minutes yeah and so we have

870
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,130
to enable our missile defense forces to

871
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:11,230
run to understand what their

872
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,630
pre-existing rules of engagements are

873
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:16,540
such that there is a if there's a shot

874
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:19,480
to one of our capitols our fielded

875
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,650
forces know exactly what their rules of

876
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,660
a

877
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,810
engagement and special instructions are

878
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:28,259
to engage that target if we try to make

879
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:31,830
decisions while the missile is in flight

880
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:34,230
we will come to that decision after CNN

881
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:36,210
International is reporting on the damage

882
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,050
yeah that was already done yeah this is

883
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,960
something that I hear a lot from

884
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:41,910
commanders particularly when for example

885
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:43,770
Mike Rogers Admiral Mike Rogers the head

886
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,720
of Cyber Command who points out that

887
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,890
there are a lot of cyber operations that

888
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,600
should be done at the tip of the spear

889
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:50,250
by an operator that's actually pretty

890
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,710
close to the action that he actually

891
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,540
needs presidential approval for because

892
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,030
that entire area is so poorly understood

893
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,290
by policy makers that they would they

894
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,760
treat it almost like it's radioactive

895
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,170
when actually you're talking about a

896
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,570
pretty simple operation that should be

897
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:06,870
at the operator level do you see like a

898
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:08,970
lot of those a lot of those different

899
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,650
decisions that you it sounds like you do

900
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,330
be left up to the operator that are

901
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,270
today governed by way too much

902
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:17,340
bureaucracy in terms of the authorities

903
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:19,380
so that's a loaded question there's a

904
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,210
lot of sort of superlatives in there but

905
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,400
I would just say that yes there are

906
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:26,760
things that we need to be addressing now

907
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,620
that will happen at speed that we need

908
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,170
to be able to react to we need to make

909
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:33,660
those policy decisions now rather than

910
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,790
discussing them when they begin to

911
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,339
unfold because then it's too late okay

912
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:40,860
I'll turn that to secretary to house key

913
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,450
to how do you handle that that dilemma

914
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:45,330
where you've got to on the one hand be

915
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:47,879
incredibly quick and reactive and enable

916
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,710
your commander at the front line but you

917
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,690
also need to maintain strict top-down

918
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,460
control how do you manage that balance I

919
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:57,980
agree with general bit of we are moving

920
00:38:53,460 --> 00:39:00,960
in many areas into pre-authorization

921
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:04,230
assumptions here so so this is baby the

922
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,530
way to do it with such a pace of the of

923
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:09,780
the warfare environment you couldn't do

924
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,940
otherwise okay again if you have

925
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,830
questions go ahead and raise your hand

926
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,000
and we've already got some all right

927
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,000
let's shoot over here to this gentleman

928
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:22,290
thank you I'm general company former

929
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,110
chief of defense in Italy and former

930
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:27,750
fighter pilot as well we are talking

931
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:29,450
about for sure policy technology

932
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:33,000
procedures

933
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:35,100
but I am afraid that we are putting too

934
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,490
much weight on technology not because we

935
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:41,790
do not need it but because we might rely

936
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:44,040
too much on it in the past we had

937
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:47,580
several examples of the technology

938
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:51,180
illusion we do not need only technology

939
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:54,690
we do we do need also numbers numbers in

940
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,640
any at any level the number of soldiers

941
00:39:54,690 --> 00:40:00,270
the number of aircraft the number of

942
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,830
ships while in the West we are reducing

943
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:07,110
these numbers and I do not see any

944
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:10,110
specific move towards an improvement of

945
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:12,870
the situation I hear about some

946
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:16,500
countries considering reintroducing

947
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:18,810
draft this is not the solution

948
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,170
I think we should be very careful about

949
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:25,410
that because in the West we are few yea

950
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:26,840
and the others are many ok let me turn

951
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,399
that a little bit into a question are we

952
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,470
right now relying a little bit too much

953
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,880
on big expensive breakthrough technology

954
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:37,830
in the absence of an actual force to

955
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,720
carry out policy what you what I think

956
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:42,090
HR McMaster back when he was head of

957
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:43,890
TRADOC would say the ability of forces

958
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:48,210
on the ground to consolidate gains and

959
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:50,250
hold territory versus the ability to say

960
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,800
take out a particular target with a

961
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:54,420
drone from 3,000 miles away but you're

962
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,530
not going to hold that ground and so

963
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,660
you're going to lose it as soon as he

964
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:00,450
vanishes

965
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:02,910
mr. krabs yep I think we're all old

966
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,830
enough to know that these things always

967
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,690
kind of fluctuate in cycles and so I

968
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,430
worked at the National Reconnaissance

969
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,900
Office for a while and that was right

970
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:14,580
around the time of the Iraq war and the

971
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,590
realization that they hadn't had WMD and

972
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,630
so there was this sense of oh we need

973
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:21,720
more human less technology because that

974
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:23,160
was after the Theia debacle as well

975
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,439
where we had spent billions and billions

976
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,480
of billions on imagery and it didn't

977
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,820
work very well and so then we went more

978
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,860
to the human intelligence side and then

979
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,480
came drones and I think one of the

980
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,250
things that was very interesting about

981
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,610
President Obama's sort of exit

982
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:41,370
interviews was kind of a confessional

983
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:41,829
tone about you know I was seduced by the

984
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:43,690
techno

985
00:41:41,829 --> 00:41:45,459
ecology this technology came along we

986
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:48,309
were all seduced by Anna and I think

987
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:50,379
that one of the reasons kind of coming

988
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:53,200
back to one of the convert discussion

989
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:57,009
points a couple minutes ago one of the

990
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,930
reasons it seems that there was this the

991
00:41:57,009 --> 00:42:01,359
the remove a bit of removal of

992
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:03,009
delegation was that there were a lot of

993
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,808
there was a lot of collateral damage in

994
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:06,969
those early years of the use of drones I

995
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:09,640
mean some estimates of like 15 to 20

996
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:11,289
percent civilian casualties and so all

997
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,808
of this again kind of comes back to

998
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:15,789
these cycles the action-reaction policy

999
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:17,979
learning which is good we should be

1000
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:20,380
learning from mistakes but the pendulum

1001
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:21,939
then often swings too far and then we

1002
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,450
have to kind of recorrect all right

1003
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,279
general Bradley had someone so I I don't

1004
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,410
disagree with what said in fact I agree

1005
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:31,630
with it but to your question directly

1006
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:34,479
having been the vice chief of one of our

1007
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:39,880
services during sort of the downturn of

1008
00:42:34,479 --> 00:42:42,218
the size of our forces very very very

1009
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,349
few of the conversations I heard were

1010
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:46,749
about we can reduce because of

1011
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:49,299
Technology the reduction was because of

1012
00:42:46,749 --> 00:42:51,098
the peace dividend we were into almost a

1013
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:54,249
decade and a half of trying to make a

1014
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:57,130
strategic partner out of Russia and so

1015
00:42:54,249 --> 00:43:00,129
we didn't need these large forces and

1016
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:02,440
the drawdown discussions were less about

1017
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:04,660
we are better because of the technology

1018
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,729
they're more about we simply don't need

1019
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,279
this force because we don't have that

1020
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:12,819
large strategic actor so I would offer

1021
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:16,959
that as a second opinion in this

1022
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:19,239
particular case in the West though you

1023
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:22,180
say we are getting smaller I think if

1024
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:23,799
you look at just I can only speak for my

1025
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:26,589
nation but if you look at our budget

1026
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:29,769
that was just turned in our services are

1027
00:43:26,589 --> 00:43:32,078
growing again we have seen the we have

1028
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:35,319
made the realization that we are too

1029
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,640
small in some services like the Army in

1030
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:38,979
the Marines we don't have enough

1031
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,348
fighting forces to be able to deploy

1032
00:43:38,979 --> 00:43:42,879
them on the cycles that we need in the

1033
00:43:41,349 --> 00:43:45,969
United States Air Force we're short of

1034
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,119
maintenance and pilots to enable our

1035
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:51,069
weapon system and so I think that there

1036
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,829
are a lot of dynamics there as well but

1037
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:54,950
the bottom line is at least our budget

1038
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,839
has recognized that we're

1039
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,640
to small and more turned around and

1040
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:00,980
headed in the other direction so let me

1041
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,720
go Stefan your thoughts on this are we

1042
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,510
relying a little bit too much in the

1043
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,430
West on technology to offset numbers and

1044
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,619
troops or to create distance where there

1045
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,750
shouldn't be or is our interest in

1046
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:13,849
technology more appropriate to are

1047
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:16,220
aligned with the possibilities of

1048
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:18,530
victory well I want to answer that by

1049
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:22,790
taking sort of a long-term view of

1050
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:24,740
military competition in general and I'm

1051
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:26,660
actually sort of also going to pose a

1052
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,720
question but perhaps someone here can

1053
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,569
answer that I just occurred to me a few

1054
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:35,270
minutes ago in debt is is there actually

1055
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:38,960
a penalty of taking delete in this

1056
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:42,190
military technological competition that

1057
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,770
is if the West consistently introduces

1058
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:47,359
expensive new military hardware that at

1059
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:50,270
some point is going to get disseminated

1060
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,848
or adopted or picked up by peer

1061
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:55,300
competitors are we not

1062
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:58,730
are we not actually getting getting

1063
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,470
punished here financially if you think

1064
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:02,990
about how much a submarine costs in

1065
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:05,660
Russia versus how much a submarine costs

1066
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:07,549
in the United States for example I mean

1067
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,899
it's one two three the United States

1068
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,910
will have an aircraft carrier that will

1069
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,640
call thirteen billion dollars before

1070
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,930
it's even you know operational and I'm

1071
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,400
thinking about this idea you know

1072
00:45:14,930 --> 00:45:21,109
there's an Ukrainian American economist

1073
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,859
Alexander gash in chrome who came up

1074
00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:26,930
with this concept of the Advanta t'v

1075
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:30,828
advantage of relative backwardness in

1076
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:32,240
the 20th century and he he he

1077
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:34,940
essentially was you know trying to

1078
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,939
figure out how quick why Germany was so

1079
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,680
good at overtaking Great Britain at the

1080
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,230
end of the 19th century in terms of

1081
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,940
economic power if you like applied it's

1082
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:46,220
now - the military competition think

1083
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,990
about the Chinese US military

1084
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,310
competition for example and look at some

1085
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:51,470
of the stuff that the Chinese are

1086
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:54,500
developing I'm just wondering whether we

1087
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:56,270
get penalized in the West developing

1088
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,490
these expensive military hardware that

1089
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:00,619
at some point the other side is going to

1090
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,939
get a lot cheaper yeah maybe not maybe

1091
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:04,250
not the same quality but at least

1092
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,260
quantitative wise yeah but the gentleman

1093
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:08,180
over there said yeah that's a it's an

1094
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,750
excellent point the write down in

1095
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:13,220
tomorrow for instance we know that

1096
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:17,329
against al-shabaab Somali forces are

1097
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:19,250
carrying out drone strikes with money

1098
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:22,400
that we've given them using drones made

1099
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:24,710
by China so that's kind of terrifying

1100
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,779
reality to have to live with let me go

1101
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,910
to you forget I just close this out with

1102
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:31,279
one short statement which i think is

1103
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:34,520
important in my opinion this is not a

1104
00:46:31,279 --> 00:46:37,309
zero-sum game it's not technology or

1105
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,130
people in fact right now our technology

1106
00:46:37,309 --> 00:46:43,069
is enabled by people tell me how many

1107
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,799
truly autonomous weapons do we have

1108
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:49,009
is anybody know of one truly autonomous

1109
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:51,770
so our people are still in the loop

1110
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:54,920
we call them our pas in the airforce

1111
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:56,779
Rivoli piloted aircraft to remind that

1112
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,960
every drone which is the word that

1113
00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:02,930
people like to use has multiple pilots

1114
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:05,599
behind it flying it and so we need not

1115
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:07,598
only the great kit we need to continue

1116
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:11,210
the move forward in refurbishing

1117
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:13,250
refitting reed kidding our forces but we

1118
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,289
have to also remember that it is the

1119
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:17,690
excellence of the troops in the West

1120
00:47:15,289 --> 00:47:20,119
that really sets us apart from our

1121
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:22,670
adversaries our kit are drawing closer

1122
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:25,039
and closer together over time it's our

1123
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:27,920
troops that make the difference in my

1124
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:30,740
opinion right so secretary Taos key this

1125
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:32,150
is a thing you have to face all the time

1126
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:34,160
on the one hand you've got allies that

1127
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,079
want to sell you incredibly exquisite

1128
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,960
and amazing pieces of military

1129
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:40,250
technology and at the same time you're

1130
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,549
looking at adversaries that are able to

1131
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:45,440
adapt really quickly just by borrowing

1132
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:49,038
by stealing and by reappropriation

1133
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,020
technology in a new way how do you make

1134
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:55,880
a distinction about what you want to do

1135
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:58,849
in that sort of situation so in this

1136
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:02,109
paper we clearly spell out that in the

1137
00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:04,880
in recent past we've over emphasized

1138
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:08,420
quality as a superior notion or over

1139
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,589
quantity and we are and the a2/ad

1140
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,510
environment highly contested

1141
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:14,750
environments is certainly not perceived

1142
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:16,940
permissive for a smaller number of more

1143
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,920
exquisite bathrooms yeah this is one

1144
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,279
notion but also in terms of the personal

1145
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,729
I mean

1146
00:48:19,279 --> 00:48:26,619
a number of armed forces in the Alliance

1147
00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:29,178
have gone far in the reduction with the

1148
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:33,709
Assumption or assertion that there will

1149
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:36,079
be a increase of quality yeah but

1150
00:48:33,709 --> 00:48:38,299
actually as you were losing quantity you

1151
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,390
were also losing quantity as you were

1152
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:43,069
losing quantity you are also losing

1153
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:45,769
quality because with less people you

1154
00:48:43,069 --> 00:48:49,549
princess you cannot exercise certain

1155
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:52,519
certain aspects pres if you lose the

1156
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:56,209
divisional level yeah capability you you

1157
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:57,288
know you cannot exercise some aspect of

1158
00:48:56,209 --> 00:49:00,288
combined-arms

1159
00:48:57,289 --> 00:49:03,169
yeah so actually this is in terms of the

1160
00:49:00,289 --> 00:49:06,289
personnel we are actually reversing the

1161
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:08,808
trend of 30 years 30 years ago in 1987

1162
00:49:06,289 --> 00:49:11,169
Polish armed force of then People's

1163
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:15,019
Republic of Poland started to reduce

1164
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:17,629
number of our forces and it took 30

1165
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:19,269
years for us now to reverse yeah the

1166
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:22,009
strength and this course also to

1167
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:25,879
technology we need to rely more on

1168
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:28,939
robust more simple systems and less on

1169
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:31,779
on exquisite platforms which doesn't

1170
00:49:28,939 --> 00:49:34,038
mean that will not by yeah for instance

1171
00:49:31,779 --> 00:49:35,569
fifth-generation fighters some some

1172
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:37,219
years from now from I think the general

1173
00:49:35,569 --> 00:49:39,699
plan works very relieved by that yeah

1174
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:42,489
yes I the Lockheed Martin people were

1175
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:44,839
where one of those where mostly you know

1176
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:46,549
treated by this paper yeah no that's

1177
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:48,469
good I would actually I'd love to get

1178
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:49,880
into this idea that somehow you can make

1179
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:52,339
a super hornet into a stealth fighter

1180
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,869
because the physics system doesn't have

1181
00:49:52,339 --> 00:49:58,009
the other let's go over here a few

1182
00:49:53,869 --> 00:50:00,160
generation partly partly an aircraft in

1183
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:02,829
communal anak

1184
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:06,609
my previous startup a supplier to SOCOM

1185
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:11,650
INSCOM DC GSA and limit fort and so on

1186
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:14,950
and we talked about the new technologies

1187
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:17,500
disruptive basically technologies coming

1188
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:21,098
to military space and then different

1189
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:25,359
culture between Bay Area or or Silicon

1190
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:27,490
Valley and military technology you know

1191
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:31,089
today is dominated by prime contractors

1192
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:33,729
and mechanism to get disruptive

1193
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:36,038
technology from smaller companies going

1194
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,950
through the budgeting cycles guaranteed

1195
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:41,829
protests and mechanisms how basically

1196
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:44,020
prime contractors basically protect

1197
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:48,309
their space is leading to the fact that

1198
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:51,009
for example today it was in president

1199
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:53,980
reports from January this year that in

1200
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:56,440
super computer technology United States

1201
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:59,650
super computer technologies five times

1202
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:02,140
lower than Chinese because the prime

1203
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:05,260
contractors did not allow the technology

1204
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:07,240
basically to reach the market and new

1205
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:10,000
technology which underpins the

1206
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,009
intelligence drones and so on which swap

1207
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,020
size weight and power twenty two hundred

1208
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:17,049
times better just did not reach the

1209
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:20,349
market because of this infrastructure so

1210
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:23,680
the question is what can be done and

1211
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:26,109
change in the way how the basically

1212
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,020
thing is development procure to enable

1213
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:31,859
this disruptive innovation from from

1214
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:34,000
Silicon Valley to be really basically

1215
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:38,859
materialized and then lead up to

1216
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,930
fielding of that so ad turn one burger

1217
00:51:38,859 --> 00:51:43,509
the prime of the primes is his lucky

1218
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:45,250
capable of self disruption I wouldn't

1219
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:47,220
call it self disruption but it but I

1220
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:49,569
think one thing that lucky does do is is

1221
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:50,919
and I want and not here to talk about

1222
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:52,089
that one talk about the bigger problem

1223
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,770
and that's the problem of how you do

1224
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:55,089
rapid acquisition mmm-hmm

1225
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,740
I think this is a problem that every

1226
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:59,520
nation faces how do you move through a

1227
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:01,720
process that you can do good analysis of

1228
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:03,038
comparative products and make a rapid

1229
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,629
decision because these are what these

1230
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:06,700
are expensive products for everybody I

1231
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:08,650
don't care what nation you're in is a

1232
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,210
very expensive product so you have to

1233
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,410
make and they're long lasting products

1234
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,780
so they're very serious and weighty

1235
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,910
decisions so I think for

1236
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:18,190
peace is innovation and embracing

1237
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,540
innovation just because companies are

1238
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:21,190
big doesn't mean they partner with

1239
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:23,650
smaller companies we see this all the

1240
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:25,960
time across industry we're always out

1241
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,490
reaching into multiple smaller companies

1242
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,080
we're looking at ideas we're bringing

1243
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:30,850
ideas and we're always chatting with

1244
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:32,830
people how we can bring ideas to the

1245
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,940
table but then getting that process into

1246
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:35,560
the acquisition process just because

1247
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,970
you're a large company doesn't mean you

1248
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:39,070
don't follow any different rules and

1249
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:40,299
smaller companies do so I think you have

1250
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:41,590
to look at the different acquisition

1251
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,240
processes and then when you go around

1252
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,280
the different nations every nation has

1253
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,509
their own process of doing

1254
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,370
decision-making getting a timely

1255
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:50,530
decision from nations

1256
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:51,970
it doesn't matter again what nation

1257
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:53,860
getting that timely decision so you can

1258
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,990
bring that technology to bear at a

1259
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,970
reasonable cost and one that is also

1260
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:00,040
going to be with that country for a long

1261
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,779
time as the key so I think acquisition

1262
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,390
reform I know we discussed yesterday

1263
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:06,370
also within the NATO context how do we

1264
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:08,319
look at are there other ways to do we've

1265
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:10,180
heard the term smart buying are there

1266
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:12,160
other ways to do smart buying that can

1267
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:14,049
be utilized to increase competition as

1268
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,089
well as also make decisions are there

1269
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,590
advantages for smaller countries with to

1270
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:19,240
partner with larger companies to still

1271
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,740
get the products they want now so I

1272
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,479
think it's a combination of innovating

1273
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,129
partnering with smaller countries and

1274
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,170
also looking at acquisition reform based

1275
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:27,280
upon your own national structure yeah I

1276
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,990
think this goes back to something that

1277
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,360
miss krebs was talking about there at

1278
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:32,680
the very beginning at you know if there

1279
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,940
wasn't something terribly wrong with the

1280
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,740
way we acquired things we wouldn't need

1281
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,330
a rapid acquisition fund because all

1282
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:39,310
that tells you is that regular

1283
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:40,600
acquisition is not rapid and we also

1284
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:41,770
would need a Silicon Valley Outreach

1285
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,990
Center and we also would need a

1286
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:45,550
strategic capabilities office so

1287
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,899
descripted seem like we're developing

1288
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:49,900
within the pentagon a bunch of

1289
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:51,820
workarounds for the bigger acquisition

1290
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:54,820
problem without actually addressing an

1291
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:59,710
acquisition problem head-on can

1292
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:01,390
acquisition be saved was a good question

1293
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:04,510
for you yeah it is I went to my first

1294
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:06,400
defense acquisition class in 1999 and

1295
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:08,050
they were touting the triple 7 as like

1296
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,720
the the new thing in defense

1297
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:12,490
acquisitions and it was a problem almost

1298
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,589
20 years ago probably even longer ago

1299
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:17,109
and they've been trying to come up with

1300
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:19,270
new lingo for how to improve it spiral

1301
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:21,010
acquisition right and and so I think

1302
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:24,520
there there are a lot of efforts that

1303
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:27,099
have made some headway but I think that

1304
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:30,009
those four structural barriers that I

1305
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:31,509
at the outset are pretty significant one

1306
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:33,430
of the things I would also point to I

1307
00:54:31,509 --> 00:54:37,799
mean you talked about Pentagon West or

1308
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:40,930
Silicon Valley of Defense or the D iux

1309
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:43,359
where the the partnerships between some

1310
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:46,390
of those kind of non-traditional defense

1311
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:48,269
firms and in defense at least in

1312
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:50,879
principle seem like they're

1313
00:54:48,269 --> 00:54:53,859
well-intentioned I haven't actually seen

1314
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,390
output from it they seem to be touting

1315
00:54:53,859 --> 00:54:57,788
the fact that everyone goes to work

1316
00:54:55,390 --> 00:55:01,598
wearing a hoodie I don't think that's a

1317
00:54:57,789 --> 00:55:07,239
deliverable necessarily uh but you know

1318
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:10,059
one of the fence firms at least carving

1319
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:13,089
out niches that are important so Textron

1320
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:15,759
with some as tactical UAVs AeroVironment

1321
00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:17,799
in in California so when I was out at

1322
00:55:15,759 --> 00:55:20,829
Stanford a couple of summers ago as a

1323
00:55:17,799 --> 00:55:23,229
fellow they were saying that Stanford

1324
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:25,479
engineering grads in the sort of the

1325
00:55:23,229 --> 00:55:27,578
hardware side the top place they want to

1326
00:55:25,479 --> 00:55:29,319
go as graduates is Tesla and the second

1327
00:55:27,579 --> 00:55:30,970
is Aero environment air environment but

1328
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:33,308
actually I think that's a close second I

1329
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:35,499
mean it 10 was kind of a sexy firm to

1330
00:55:33,309 --> 00:55:37,299
work for but the fact that AeroVironment

1331
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:39,609
is still up there for Stanford grads I

1332
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:42,279
think a narrow vironment of course is is

1333
00:55:39,609 --> 00:55:44,859
a purveyor for defense technology I

1334
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:46,749
think is indicating that there is some

1335
00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:48,700
degree of change and how that's working

1336
00:55:46,749 --> 00:55:50,859
yeah and and you know what I think that

1337
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:53,200
the real mover is the level of urgency

1338
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:55,239
that's felt by the operator and getting

1339
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,239
that level of urgency communicated and

1340
00:55:55,239 --> 00:55:59,710
in a quick way for instance back a

1341
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,690
couple months ago

1342
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:03,369
SOCOM put out an urgent request for

1343
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:04,869
exactly what you're talking about the

1344
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:06,160
AeroVironment makes these little drones

1345
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:07,779
called switchblade drones and they're

1346
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,069
basically little kamikaze drones you

1347
00:56:07,779 --> 00:56:10,599
shoot them out of can and they fly

1348
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:12,519
overhead and it's like a lawyer munition

1349
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:15,279
it paused the thing so there was a

1350
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:17,649
special urgent request for about 350

1351
00:56:15,279 --> 00:56:19,479
rounds of these and if not for that

1352
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:21,489
urgent request coming from the operator

1353
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:23,439
at the tip of the spear then that

1354
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:25,509
acquisition goal is never met so there's

1355
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,930
got to be I think some better way to

1356
00:56:25,509 --> 00:56:30,999
streamline that operator need to command

1357
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:32,979
and all of these little endeavors are

1358
00:56:30,999 --> 00:56:35,019
kind of ways to do it but that's really

1359
00:56:32,979 --> 00:56:37,509
where the demand signals got it I think

1360
00:56:35,019 --> 00:56:38,379
kind of come from and until that's part

1361
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:39,579
of the way we acquire things

1362
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:43,049
holistically I don't see

1363
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:43,049
having a solution let's go right here

1364
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:51,519
question flooding possible if not scraps

1365
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:53,589
family mentioned that there are thirty

1366
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:57,038
billionaire's who were young kids came

1367
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:58,328
out Silicon Valley if you're young kid

1368
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:02,650
and you think you've got a bright idea

1369
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:06,099
in the defense sector how do you pitch

1370
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:10,719
it to the defense sector where do you go

1371
00:57:06,099 --> 00:57:15,099
what's the channel up drew why are all

1372
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:17,459
the thirty billionaires as it were in

1373
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:19,900
the civilian sector not in the defense

1374
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:22,569
logically you would have thought one of

1375
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:26,380
those thirty if not more would be in the

1376
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:28,749
defense sector if you have ideas on this

1377
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:30,489
III think this is a significant problem

1378
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:32,410
I think if you're that person you drop

1379
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:33,910
out of college and you work in your

1380
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:36,118
parent's garage and you come up with the

1381
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:38,799
idea and then you pitch it to Google and

1382
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,599
but I don't know I don't know that

1383
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:42,459
there's a and I think that's why what di

1384
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:43,900
u X is trying to do is sort of

1385
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:46,598
facilitate that but I don't think

1386
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:49,180
there's any mechanism for that sort of

1387
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:51,190
process taking place within could I just

1388
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:54,669
say that I just watched this process

1389
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:58,959
work in the soft world in the last two

1390
00:57:54,670 --> 00:58:02,890
weeks where two young men developed a

1391
00:57:58,959 --> 00:58:05,709
very lightweight garment that is an

1392
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:07,719
automatic way to stop blood loss if

1393
00:58:05,709 --> 00:58:10,299
you're hurt on the battlefield and

1394
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:13,900
someone can't get to you quickly very

1395
00:58:10,299 --> 00:58:16,420
light very easy way to initiate a self

1396
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:18,759
tourniquet to stop bleeding and what

1397
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:22,709
they did was Mary they went out and said

1398
00:58:18,759 --> 00:58:25,959
who would want this and could restate

1399
00:58:22,709 --> 00:58:28,058
requirement they met people in the

1400
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:30,729
Special Forces world who tended to work

1401
00:58:28,059 --> 00:58:34,809
more alone and more at distance from

1402
00:58:30,729 --> 00:58:38,410
medical care and width and inin spirit

1403
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:40,569
of entrepreneurial effort found the

1404
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:43,420
person that might have the requirement

1405
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:45,339
sure enough the requirement was set and

1406
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:48,369
now they're well along their way to

1407
00:58:45,339 --> 00:58:49,410
being able to work this into the soft

1408
00:58:48,369 --> 00:58:52,680
world

1409
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:55,170
so it's not enough to be a smart

1410
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,690
inventor if you also are not an

1411
00:58:55,170 --> 00:59:00,420
entrepreneur who goes out and finds out

1412
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:03,780
how to connect to requirements to bring

1413
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,490
a mating of a capability to a

1414
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,020
requirement yeah so it's it's

1415
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:09,740
interesting because all the services

1416
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:11,940
acquire things sort of differently and

1417
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:13,439
probably what most rapid is exactly

1418
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:18,090
there's the Special Operations Forces

1419
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,530
guys that have both an ability to go out

1420
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:23,340
there and get technology really quickly

1421
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:24,300
but also more latitude to acquire things

1422
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,860
that they're going to have to share with

1423
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,540
partner militaries because the scotf

1424
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,580
guys in particular to acquire things by

1425
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:32,279
themselves so in terms of a service to

1426
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:34,140
reach out to they're probably the most

1427
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,940
open to these young entrepreneurs that

1428
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:38,009
that you're thinking of but it's a it's

1429
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,750
a big problem I just want to add it just

1430
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:41,070
this won't answer your whole question

1431
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:43,110
but just from an industry's perspective

1432
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:44,640
I know it's it's very competitive most

1433
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:47,150
intrigued with as one of our major

1434
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:51,540
efforts all year round is seeking out

1435
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:52,980
talent across the global economy all

1436
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:56,220
different types of talent very

1437
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:58,830
competitive starting we do we hold

1438
00:59:56,220 --> 01:00:00,149
competitions to seek talent out to even

1439
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:02,009
down at the high school level we're

1440
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:03,990
starting to bring people in with

1441
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:05,760
industry funding to say hey here's a

1442
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:07,529
project here's a problem go show us how

1443
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,990
you solve it and then we track those

1444
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:11,490
individuals we try to encourage them one

1445
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:13,169
for their own in the national benefit

1446
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:14,640
for the global benefit to increase their

1447
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:16,260
educational skills to compete in the

1448
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:18,000
global market but we are constantly

1449
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:19,440
seeking out talent throughout the world

1450
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,150
again that's not going to solve

1451
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,400
everybody who's in there like you say

1452
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:24,840
parents garage but again we try to give

1453
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,970
them that structure I'll also tell you

1454
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:28,770
that in the some that some of these

1455
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:32,009
smart young folks that also have a sense

1456
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:34,500
of dedication to national defense do

1457
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:35,940
seek out defense industry because they

1458
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,950
find that's a good environment for them

1459
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:39,900
to work in they do feel like they're

1460
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:42,509
contributing to a long-term goal and

1461
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:44,490
that everybody's different as humans so

1462
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:46,260
they have a human factor that fits what

1463
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,850
they want as well as not everybody's cut

1464
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,190
out to be the entrepreneur either but we

1465
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:51,990
do seek these folks all year round all

1466
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:54,330
around the globe and I know all our all

1467
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:55,770
our friends and competitors and

1468
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:57,009
teammates and industry do the same

1469
01:00:55,770 --> 01:01:00,759
things very

1470
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:02,830
I write more questions thank you yes

1471
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,690
right there the lady in the row right

1472
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,830
there

1473
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:08,230
the Center for Russia Europe Asia

1474
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:09,880
studies just to respond I have two

1475
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,350
comments general breedlove you threw out

1476
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,090
some very interesting grenades there at

1477
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,440
the beginning very provocative and you

1478
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,750
mentioned Hollywood and as we know

1479
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:19,510
during World War two Hollywood was used

1480
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:21,940
to help create the anti-nazi message but

1481
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:24,280
there hasn't been a negative film on

1482
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,750
China in 20 years so the Chinese have

1483
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,480
understood that probably better than the

1484
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:29,950
United States and in today's New York

1485
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,220
Times there's an op-ed written by Neil

1486
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:35,230
Sheehan part of the 1967 Vietnam series

1487
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:36,910
and he starts with there are some events

1488
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:38,850
which can be understood only with the

1489
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:41,710
perspective of time and let's not forget

1490
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:43,750
Vietnam beat the US with very very low

1491
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:45,250
tech yeah what we've seen now is in

1492
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:47,140
Crimea we've seen little green men in

1493
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:49,540
Crimea little blue men in the South

1494
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:53,200
China Sea China's salami slicing

1495
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:55,300
technique of just doing things below the

1496
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,310
radar so the US military can't respond

1497
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:59,200
has been proven very successful now they

1498
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:01,390
have seven islands artificial islands

1499
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,430
that are militarized so if the u.s.

1500
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:05,620
becomes more technological I think

1501
01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:07,390
adversaries will become more asymmetric

1502
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:11,890
in their approach how do we respond

1503
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:14,319
Thanks so so that could I challenge one

1504
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:17,440
sentence you said doing things in a

1505
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:18,220
salami slice way so that America can't

1506
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,040
respond

1507
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:23,259
I don't think Kant is the right word we

1508
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,509
could respond but we choose not to

1509
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:27,850
I think the dilemma you're painting is

1510
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:30,520
that they're taking actions below a

1511
01:02:27,850 --> 01:02:32,740
threshold at which they think they can

1512
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:35,110
get away with it we certainly have the

1513
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:37,029
capability to respond we just choose not

1514
01:02:35,110 --> 01:02:39,250
to so I don't know if you agree with

1515
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:41,530
that that sort of correction of the

1516
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:43,270
conundrum I think it's it's important

1517
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:44,320
and I get that's sort of related to that

1518
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:46,480
chart that you showed me last night

1519
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,940
there's an entire chart that exists

1520
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,980
where there's a threshold of activity

1521
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:53,380
and as long as we're operating beneath

1522
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,030
it then we're vulnerable to all sorts of

1523
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:57,760
active if you google guru so mob

1524
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:59,920
doctrine and hit images you'll find a

1525
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,130
chart that he builds where he talks

1526
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,990
about his war I call it war below the

1527
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:08,440
lines and

1528
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:12,750
he calls it indirect means and methods

1529
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:16,750
but in this chart you look at how they

1530
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:19,270
approach this what some call hybrid war

1531
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:22,930
I don't like that word but some call

1532
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:24,790
hybrid war and what the grass of off

1533
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:26,919
doctrine talks about is how much you can

1534
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:29,470
get away with in an in an individual

1535
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:31,360
country in some countries you can get

1536
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,609
very far right on the chart and you're

1537
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:36,220
at a very high line a very high

1538
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:37,990
threshold in other countries you get

1539
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:40,540
away with certain things and your

1540
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:42,879
threshold is lower but the point that I

1541
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:45,790
get from that chart is I read what's in

1542
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,560
this thing is that this is active in

1543
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:50,470
almost every nation it is certainly

1544
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:52,090
active in my nation do you think that

1545
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:54,790
we're becoming more vulnerable to those

1546
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:56,320
indirect means or are we becoming more

1547
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:58,090
impervious up to them because we're

1548
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,280
having a conversation about them more

1549
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:02,830
frequently now in the wake of the 2016

1550
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:06,400
election meddling so so I think the

1551
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:08,380
answer is yes and no the we are more

1552
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,670
vulnerable because again we haven't

1553
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:14,890
taken the policy decisions to respond

1554
01:04:11,670 --> 01:04:16,960
below those lines we could respond in

1555
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:19,629
information warfare we have chosen

1556
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:22,030
really not to take the field we could

1557
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:24,490
respond in cyber we have distinct

1558
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:27,970
limitations as you heard on what we can

1559
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:30,310
do in cyber so we have policy that sets

1560
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:32,319
a certain threshold and and our

1561
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:34,180
opponents are finding out exactly where

1562
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,550
that threshold is and they're operating

1563
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:38,319
to their greatest extent below that

1564
01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:41,910
knowing that we won't respond

1565
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:45,190
so the real discussion is - what will we

1566
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:47,710
allow ourselves to be subjected yeah

1567
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:49,990
before we move out and then clearly in

1568
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:53,109
some cases and technology technology

1569
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:55,180
some of it could change this this

1570
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:56,590
conundrum all right let's go you had

1571
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,210
something on them yeah I was going to

1572
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:59,859
say that I think the domain matters a

1573
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:02,200
lot and I'm glad you brought up cyber

1574
01:04:59,859 --> 01:05:05,950
because I think that introduces a whole

1575
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:10,419
new degree of sort of reluctance to

1576
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:12,339
engage because of the sense that that is

1577
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:16,420
any response to sort of disproportionate

1578
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:20,470
so I've done these experiments and

1579
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:23,110
I create these cyber 911 scenarios like

1580
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:24,970
really apocalyptic scenarios where

1581
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,980
thousands of Americans are dying because

1582
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:29,379
of a cyber attacks or a kinetic attack

1583
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:32,400
and you cannot get people to say that

1584
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:34,330
they will retaliate using kinetic

1585
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,100
responses because they're worried about

1586
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:37,180
escalation and if you think it so

1587
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,950
they're sort of the the public opinion

1588
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,620
piece of this which i think is very

1589
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:44,529
important but what that does of course

1590
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:46,900
is is play into the deterrence or the

1591
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:48,730
lack of deterrence right because the

1592
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:51,250
potential sort of offending country

1593
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:54,510
knows or anticipates that we won't

1594
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:57,070
respond because of this sort of the

1595
01:05:54,510 --> 01:05:58,540
hurdle that it takes from the public

1596
01:05:57,070 --> 01:05:59,950
opinion yeah so one of the things we

1597
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,150
talked about last night in dealing with

1598
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:03,279
this as a whole of government response

1599
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:06,520
we've got military you've got economic

1600
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:09,100
you've got diplomatic are we using those

1601
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:10,120
levers effectively right now against an

1602
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:13,960
adversary like Russia

1603
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:15,790
oh that's do you that's the moment I'm

1604
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,520
happy to answer I just want to see if

1605
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:21,279
anybody else was like um certainly I

1606
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,890
think not I think that if we look at

1607
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:26,710
individual actions that we have faced in

1608
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:29,980
the recent past we have done things in a

1609
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:31,680
very unbalanced manner we don't we are

1610
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:34,920
being attacked in a whole-of-government

1611
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,250
way if you look at what happened in

1612
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,860
Ukraine

1613
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:42,250
you see diplomatic efforts to discredit

1614
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:44,980
Kiev and everything keep does you see an

1615
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,870
intense information campaign attacking

1616
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,490
the credibility of the government and

1617
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:50,560
the connection of the government to the

1618
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:53,680
people you clearly see a Russian

1619
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:55,690
military action enabling the folks in

1620
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:58,210
the in the east and Russian direct

1621
01:06:55,690 --> 01:07:02,160
action in the east etc and you see an

1622
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:05,230
economic piece where Russia attacks via

1623
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:08,080
energy pricing recalling of loans etc

1624
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:11,500
etc so you see abroad all of government

1625
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:13,720
approach we in the West tend to not

1626
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:16,810
answer in a broad all of government

1627
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:19,089
answer if you will allow me to use the

1628
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:21,790
the silly little model that we use in

1629
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:23,150
war colleges called dime diplomatic

1630
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:25,790
informational Miller

1631
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:30,320
Terry and economic what did we do in

1632
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:34,730
Lippe Libya we had very little D we had

1633
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:37,370
hardly any I we had a massive M and we

1634
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:39,470
all had almost no e so we threw the

1635
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:42,109
military at Libya with no plans for

1636
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:44,209
diplomatic informational Ektron economic

1637
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:47,770
and you see what we ended up in in

1638
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:51,280
Ukraine how have we responded some

1639
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:54,970
diplomatic efforts almost zero

1640
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:58,670
informational efforts very limited

1641
01:07:54,970 --> 01:08:01,790
military efforts and a pretty strong

1642
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:05,510
package of economic sanctions and so

1643
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:07,490
again a very unbalanced approach to the

1644
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:10,130
Ukrainian problem when they're being

1645
01:08:07,490 --> 01:08:13,220
attacked broadly across all of the

1646
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:14,870
elements and so I think that the NATO

1647
01:08:13,220 --> 01:08:17,420
for years has been talking about the

1648
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:21,529
comprehensive approach but we really

1649
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:25,580
don't answer attacks on us with a

1650
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:29,000
comprehensive response and I think that

1651
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:31,069
there is much to be gained by

1652
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,010
understanding that we have to meet an

1653
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:37,069
all of government attack within all of

1654
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:38,750
government response secretary Chao ski

1655
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:39,769
as one of our NATO allies is that

1656
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,319
something that you perceive do you

1657
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:43,940
perceive the u.s. across government

1658
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:47,120
response to Russian activity as

1659
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:49,370
sufficient or insufficient I agree that

1660
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,019
there are limits in a democracy to what

1661
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:52,939
you can do in terms of the interagency

1662
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:55,150
response for instance certain

1663
01:08:52,939 --> 01:08:57,950
full-spectrum measures need to be

1664
01:08:55,149 --> 01:09:01,490
overseen by by the Parliament but by the

1665
01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:03,529
Congress so you cannot act in in the

1666
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:05,090
utmost secrecy like you know the Putin's

1667
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:07,250
rate regime can you know they are much

1668
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:10,279
better in orchestrating those loose

1669
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:13,609
instruments at the same time obeying

1670
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:15,529
those rules you know creative society

1671
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:17,960
which is based on the freedom which

1672
01:09:15,529 --> 01:09:20,569
which is more faith fair title to

1673
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,090
producing things that we are talking

1674
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:24,380
today about I mean the disruptive

1675
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:27,140
technologies so these are two sides of

1676
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:30,910
one coin mm-hmm okay the more questions

1677
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:30,910
here right here in the front row

1678
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:37,429
I just invoke foreign affairs magazine

1679
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:39,170
general breedlove I want to take the

1680
01:09:37,429 --> 01:09:41,149
bait on one of the things you said at

1681
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:44,299
the outset you talk about human genome

1682
01:09:41,149 --> 01:09:46,488
editing and seemed to sort of relish the

1683
01:09:44,299 --> 01:09:48,439
prospect that that might lead to the

1684
01:09:46,488 --> 01:09:51,379
engineered engineering of a better

1685
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:53,559
soldier is that something that is that

1686
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:56,900
you are actually comfortable with and

1687
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:58,909
better than are there well because and I

1688
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,290
want to know this because obviously I

1689
01:09:58,909 --> 01:10:01,280
wonder if you're comfortable to Chinese

1690
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:02,869
doing it and whether if you're

1691
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,360
comfortable with everybody doing that

1692
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:07,610
seems like I know you said it sounds

1693
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:09,679
crazy but I agree with you that a lot of

1694
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:11,389
stuff that sounds crazy and science

1695
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:13,849
fiction becomes science fact and that is

1696
01:10:11,389 --> 01:10:17,750
actually out there and with CRISPR it's

1697
01:10:13,849 --> 01:10:19,520
become only more of a potential so I

1698
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:21,380
want to see that a little bit more so

1699
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,800
fat you you actually answered your own

1700
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:27,739
question and that whether I'm

1701
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:32,030
comfortable with it or not is almost

1702
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:35,690
irrelevant remember are you you're not

1703
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:37,009
gonna get that answer like I get to I

1704
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:40,790
have the mic so you're not going to get

1705
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:43,010
that into the bottom line is that I

1706
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:44,480
think this is going to happen and many

1707
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:46,849
other people think this is going to

1708
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,820
happen and I've said at least twice in

1709
01:10:46,849 --> 01:10:52,880
this conference in either other sessions

1710
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:55,549
or entering the enemy gets a vote we

1711
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:59,090
will face this in the future in the same

1712
01:10:55,550 --> 01:11:00,920
way that people sort of look at Star

1713
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:02,750
Wars and think about the x-wing fighter

1714
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:06,800
and they laugh just like we laughed at

1715
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:10,099
the Star Trek communicators we will

1716
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,969
eventually fight in space it is going to

1717
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:16,610
happen and so I think that we have to

1718
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:19,790
choose to be able to deal with it yeah

1719
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:20,989
so right now as context the military has

1720
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:24,920
a couple of different research avenues

1721
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:27,049
into this area DARPA in 2014 I believe

1722
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:29,420
stood up a new biotechnology office that

1723
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:31,429
approaches synthetic biology as a as a

1724
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:32,630
potential threat area the Air Force

1725
01:11:31,429 --> 01:11:34,070
Research Lab is doing some really

1726
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:36,349
interesting and important work in

1727
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:38,630
biotechnology research but that's mostly

1728
01:11:36,349 --> 01:11:40,340
in terms of understanding how different

1729
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:42,380
pathogens might be weaponized and also

1730
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:43,870
creating better supplements of course if

1731
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:45,790
you look at diff

1732
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:47,800
and cultural attitudes towards human

1733
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:49,120
genome editing in say China which is in

1734
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,230
many ways leading researching this

1735
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:52,450
you're going to find something very

1736
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:54,400
different than the sort of norms that

1737
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:56,410
we're used to so right here on the front

1738
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,009
row who have been neglecting for a while

1739
01:11:56,410 --> 01:12:01,240
right right there

1740
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:05,130
thank you yes Brooks tigner Jane's

1741
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:07,420
defense Brussels if we're to believe the

1742
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:09,760
predictions and the projections and all

1743
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:11,950
the pronouncements about AI then indeed

1744
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,140
in the future the future of warfare is

1745
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:15,880
machine the machine with increasingly

1746
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,560
fewer people needed to make these

1747
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,680
machines run they don't run them by

1748
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:24,370
themselves so my question to any of you

1749
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,590
on the on this on the panel is would you

1750
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:27,960
have you studied or would you care to

1751
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:31,300
hazard a guess

1752
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,400
about by how much flesh and blood armies

1753
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:35,890
are going to shrink in the future as

1754
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:37,360
machines take over warfare because the

1755
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:39,250
logic would suggest that is going to

1756
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,630
happen and also in the knowledge that is

1757
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:43,240
going to be very difficult for pollak

1758
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:47,590
future politicians to justify both of

1759
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:49,300
these expensive components thank you so

1760
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:52,780
while others are thinking I'll kick it

1761
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:54,880
off I I much as I did up here I would

1762
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:56,980
disagree with your last sentence you

1763
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,990
said logic would suggest this is going

1764
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:02,280
to happen I think that what we have

1765
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:09,040
learned consistently over time is that

1766
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:12,450
while while huge forces are required to

1767
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:15,150
fight and that may change over time

1768
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:20,200
you're not going to be able to occupy

1769
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:21,910
and/or rebuild with a tiny force we are

1770
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:26,530
always going to end up in a place where

1771
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:28,450
we need to be able to administer or use

1772
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:31,440
other words if you want control or

1773
01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:34,900
whatever territory and to be able to

1774
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:38,080
control those various spheres of warfare

1775
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:42,129
from land air sea space cyber etc and

1776
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:45,370
those will always take people I truly

1777
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:47,680
believe I flew the f-16 for 26 years I

1778
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:51,460
think technology is an amazing thing the

1779
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:53,500
f-16 I flew back in the early 80s was

1780
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:55,400
incredibly different than the one that I

1781
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:59,260
flew when I stopped as a

1782
01:13:55,400 --> 01:14:03,559
as a major general in the Air Force but

1783
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:06,740
all across time one thing has been very

1784
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:11,150
steady the requirement for a soldier

1785
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:14,030
sailor Airman or marine to do their job

1786
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:18,170
and to hold the ground air land sea

1787
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:19,940
space or cyber after an attack so I I

1788
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:23,660
just must tell you you asked my opinion

1789
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:25,519
I must tell you I don't think that we

1790
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:28,970
will ever have a time where our force

1791
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:31,490
will shrink down to you know the one guy

1792
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:35,060
playing the piccolo at the computer

1793
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:38,690
board driving exquisite weaponry I think

1794
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:43,640
there's other things one other aspect in

1795
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:45,860
these situations or you have a force the

1796
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:49,010
person on the other side is is going to

1797
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:52,160
be a human more likely whether it's a

1798
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:56,120
civilian population I don't see the

1799
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:58,130
interaction between somebody on the

1800
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:00,860
other side he's not the soldier who is

1801
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:02,990
the 9 combatant interacting with a

1802
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:04,009
machine I think that's going to still

1803
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:06,230
there's still going to be a human

1804
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:07,790
element for a long long time I think

1805
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:11,330
humans will always be involved but when

1806
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:13,040
it comes to this type of warfare I just

1807
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:14,990
don't know when you see these science

1808
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,820
fiction movies I just don't know if if a

1809
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:18,110
noncombatant or somebody who's just had

1810
01:15:16,820 --> 01:15:20,059
their house destroyed is going to feel

1811
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:22,519
real comfortable with a robot coming up

1812
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:25,760
to them to tell them to go to block 27

1813
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:26,960
for medical attention versus a a person

1814
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,020
coming up to them with care and

1815
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:32,540
compassion I think that to me is going

1816
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:34,550
to be a different part that technology

1817
01:15:32,540 --> 01:15:37,340
will enable but that you will always

1818
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:38,390
need that because the world's made of

1819
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:40,400
humans and you're always going to need

1820
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:42,590
humans to interact with humans so just a

1821
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:45,469
personal thought can I just add that I

1822
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:48,020
think it for it will really depend on

1823
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:50,360
the context for ISR it completely makes

1824
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:54,320
sense to kind of turn this over to

1825
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:56,150
unmanned assets but when you think about

1826
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,830
the differences between getting back to

1827
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:59,960
this earlier comment about what makes

1828
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:02,269
good militaries it is the people and

1829
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:04,070
it's how those people interrelate and

1830
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:07,100
their esprit de corps and those are

1831
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:09,309
functions of sort of human attributes I

1832
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:11,470
don't think that the battlefield is it

1833
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:13,360
of chess where you can have this this

1834
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:14,620
robot that beats the the best chess

1835
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,880
player in the world I don't think the

1836
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:17,890
battlefield is like that I think I

1837
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,080
disagree with the my colleagues that

1838
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:21,730
think that you still will need in these

1839
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:25,120
contexts sort of the coming together of

1840
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:31,719
like a platoon level to go carry out the

1841
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:33,580
mission I'll point you to a really

1842
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:36,310
interesting study it's called the ten

1843
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:42,040
things we learn from Star Wars and one

1844
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:43,540
of them is their stormtroopers but I do

1845
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:46,810
anything to raise the question of

1846
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:48,250
balance yeah so it's in many of these

1847
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,660
topics today has been a balance about

1848
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,370
technology it's been a balance about

1849
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:53,260
people's for been balanced about budgets

1850
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:55,840
a balance about decisions in science

1851
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:57,400
about policy all these are constantly in

1852
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,080
airplane I come back to my earlier point

1853
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,910
that's where I think the disruptive

1854
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:03,250
technologies come in place if you can

1855
01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:04,720
bring these balances into a form where

1856
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:06,520
you do innovation and technology

1857
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,720
innovation and policy innovation and

1858
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,250
thought innovation artificial

1859
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:11,080
intelligence that's where you'll find

1860
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,610
the disruptive this technology will

1861
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,230
enable that disruptiveness but you've

1862
01:17:12,610 --> 01:17:15,639
got to bring it together in a holistic

1863
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:17,740
fashion if you can't bring it together

1864
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,580
in a holistic fashion then we'll

1865
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:21,730
continue as we are

1866
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:23,080
I admire the ambition of trying to get

1867
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:24,700
military command where you commit to a

1868
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,519
smaller force size that would be

1869
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:29,470
historic if that happened an open forum

1870
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,850
let's take one more question and then

1871
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:33,660
we're going to go to concluding remarks

1872
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:39,630
so who here has right here in the center

1873
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:39,630
sure we can get him right there that guy

1874
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:44,860
semi long calendar the youth Atlantic

1875
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:46,930
Treaty Association from Sweden so I'd

1876
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:48,820
just like to return to the historical

1877
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:51,100
perspective it was previously discussion

1878
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:52,809
about but rules and I'm just wondering

1879
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:54,340
if there are any lessons to learn from

1880
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:56,080
history when it comes to the

1881
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,570
introduction of new weapon systems new

1882
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,760
weapon technologies and a development of

1883
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:07,000
rules and norms regulating how those

1884
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:10,800
weapon systems are used thank you well

1885
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:16,000
um I think the best example right now is

1886
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:18,970
for example cyber weapons in general or

1887
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,620
cyber capabilities router right and I've

1888
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:22,900
been part of a study couple of years ago

1889
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:25,750
where we tried to adopt the Geneva and

1890
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:28,629
hate conventions for cyberspace and so

1891
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:33,130
we did a thorough study of those

1892
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:34,630
conventions and ultimately what happens

1893
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:36,040
usually historically is at the beginning

1894
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:39,880
all of these things are fairly

1895
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:42,670
unregulated usually you go back to the

1896
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:44,020
Middle Ages and you know the

1897
01:18:42,670 --> 01:18:46,330
introduction of the quote you know

1898
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:48,250
English longbow for example some would

1899
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:50,440
classify that as a disruptive military

1900
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:52,360
technology I tend to agree it

1901
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:55,960
fundamentally changed the feudal system

1902
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:59,160
and ultimately made you know mounted

1903
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:02,040
warrior obsolete in the long run and

1904
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:04,180
they banned it the church back then

1905
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:05,980
banded they issued a think even of

1906
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:08,560
people both I might be wrong about that

1907
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:12,190
but in any case so anyone who would use

1908
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:14,740
a longbow in combat or a crossbow

1909
01:19:12,190 --> 01:19:19,089
would be excommunicated and if they were

1910
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:20,679
called I think immediately executed now

1911
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:23,560
this was obviously a very harsh example

1912
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:30,250
but generally I think it will take a lot

1913
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:31,990
of a lot of determination to really

1914
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:33,670
implement and put limits on some of

1915
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:34,840
these systems because I think when they

1916
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:37,600
are out there they're out there and they

1917
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:39,670
will be used eventually and that of

1918
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,050
course you know includes also all the

1919
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:43,930
new forms of warfare that we were

1920
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:45,910
talking about with the exception of

1921
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:47,860
course of some of the things that we saw

1922
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:49,809
you know during the Second World War for

1923
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:52,089
example with chemical warfare and stuff

1924
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:53,020
so I mean some limitations may apply but

1925
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:54,400
generally I think it will be

1926
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:56,740
particularly the cyber field will be

1927
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:00,309
very difficult to really limit any of

1928
01:19:56,740 --> 01:20:03,639
these weapons okay so in in thinking

1929
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:06,150
about how to sort of conclude here I'd

1930
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:08,350
like to also promise a proposed

1931
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:10,150
historical example that might be

1932
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:12,820
relevant to the discussion of military

1933
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:15,250
disruption so my favorite disruptive

1934
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:19,120
military technology in history was the

1935
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:21,880
use of the Arab esker by samurai warlord

1936
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,330
odo Nobunaga in 1547 so here's what

1937
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:25,840
happened

1938
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:28,450
Oda Nobunaga samurai warlord is holding

1939
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:32,290
a castle and he's faced by a much larger

1940
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:34,090
force by Takata kasoori and this is a

1941
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:35,369
conventional force he's got cutlery has

1942
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:38,619
pikemen he's got

1943
01:20:35,369 --> 01:20:40,348
Cavalry's got archers Nobunaga does this

1944
01:20:38,619 --> 01:20:43,030
he gets his arabesque

1945
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:45,550
15:47 and they're using guns that take

1946
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:47,949
like five minutes to load basically big

1947
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:51,699
muskets and he sets him up and around

1948
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:53,500
and as the first wave approaches the

1949
01:20:51,699 --> 01:20:55,719
arabesque errs lay him down as the

1950
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:57,730
second wave of force approaches the

1951
01:20:55,719 --> 01:20:59,110
arabesque errs just lay him down and he

1952
01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:00,879
basically created the first human

1953
01:20:59,110 --> 01:21:02,889
machine gun and everyone said that's

1954
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,500
really in this honorable way to conduct

1955
01:21:02,889 --> 01:21:10,239
warfare but he held that castle and he

1956
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:13,809
took over Japan so in closing what is

1957
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:17,530
the arabesque or technology in the next

1958
01:21:13,809 --> 01:21:19,449
five to ten years and do we have it or

1959
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:21,940
does the adversary I'll start with You

1960
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:24,369
general you're looking back you look at

1961
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:27,098
that so so I'm going to take the safe

1962
01:21:24,369 --> 01:21:29,889
road out if you want to talk the next

1963
01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:32,349
four to five years I go back to my

1964
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:35,559
original premise the most disruptive

1965
01:21:32,349 --> 01:21:38,440
things we could do is to redress our

1966
01:21:35,559 --> 01:21:41,469
policy and see how we can use the tools

1967
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:44,650
that we already have better we find

1968
01:21:41,469 --> 01:21:48,190
ourselves set flint self limiting okay

1969
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:50,739
go ahead in a short-term perspective I'm

1970
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:54,250
afraid this is the simplification of

1971
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:56,829
this system between the sensor and and

1972
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,460
shooter and I'm afraid that bad guys are

1973
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,469
at the moment

1974
01:21:57,460 --> 01:22:00,969
it'll be better than the nos in the

1975
01:21:59,469 --> 01:22:04,030
longer term I believe the directed

1976
01:22:00,969 --> 01:22:05,710
energy will turn this

1977
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:08,080
relationship upside down and actually

1978
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:11,830
the West has an upper hand with it

1979
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:14,370
okay it's public I'll step out and say

1980
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:16,300
precision-guided non-kinetic weapons

1981
01:22:14,370 --> 01:22:18,309
precision got a nine connected weddings

1982
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:21,160
are the are the aerobatic yeah

1983
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:23,760
alright uh that's good to know go ahead

1984
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:26,320
let's go I would say militarized

1985
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:30,430
civilian drones on the homeland

1986
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:33,009
okay I'm sort of taking the idea of a

1987
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:35,020
suicide bomber that can find where the

1988
01:22:33,010 --> 01:22:37,270
most densely populated area but instead

1989
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:39,940
of blowing himself up he kind of swoops

1990
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:41,290
in a drone and does it that way and it

1991
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:43,599
will be it will be a weapon of mass

1992
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:45,970
destruction but it will be a weapon of

1993
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,190
mass disruption at least outside well

1994
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,330
actually that's a we have a touch more

1995
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:51,280
time than I originally thought

1996
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:53,920
let's on this question of the use of

1997
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:58,650
consumer drones in a incredibly

1998
01:22:53,920 --> 01:23:01,720
disruptive way do we have a effective

1999
01:22:58,650 --> 01:23:05,530
defense against that in a civilian

2000
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:08,890
setting and if not what are we doing

2001
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:11,050
about that I'll go with human scratch

2002
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:13,960
well they were demonstrating one just

2003
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:16,900
outside here earlier I dunno maybe you

2004
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:18,760
saw this so apparently there's some

2005
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:19,870
emerging technology but I mean I think

2006
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,270
like with everything it's a

2007
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:24,700
cat-and-mouse game it's like they we

2008
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,200
come up with some sort of countermeasure

2009
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:29,380
IRA measure and they'll come up with a

2010
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:31,570
countermeasure so so I just say I think

2011
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:33,910
we are working on technologies to

2012
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:36,549
counter this the real problem is think

2013
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:39,130
of the scope right how many of these

2014
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:40,810
kind of technologies would you need to

2015
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:44,260
protect Bratislava

2016
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:47,110
yeah the scope is really very infinite

2017
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:49,000
soft targets out there yeah so

2018
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:51,070
especially when you talk about urban

2019
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,870
warfare and the use of these in an urban

2020
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:55,120
setting their best technology we have to

2021
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:57,070
defend against them is jamming any W and

2022
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,840
you can't do that in an environment

2023
01:23:57,070 --> 01:24:00,400
where you've got up to five million

2024
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:03,670
different cell phone users that's not

2025
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:06,070
really going to work so what is the

2026
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:09,010
technology that defeats small consumer

2027
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:10,630
drones in an urban warfare setting in

2028
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:14,140
the next ten years okay you loot in

2029
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:15,580
general that's going to be demand but

2030
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:16,850
it's gonna be I think is so I think that

2031
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:18,440
quickest way

2032
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:19,670
maybe not the quickest way but I think

2033
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,080
one of the realistic ways again goes

2034
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:23,660
back to non kinetics because you have

2035
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:25,490
yeah you have options in the in the

2036
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:27,800
electronic space you have options in

2037
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:30,559
cyber you have all kinds of options to

2038
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:32,390
do that okay all right now let's go to

2039
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,310
Stephanie's gonna yeah I think that the

2040
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:36,440
one thing that worries me most in the

2041
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:38,660
next five to ten years is the

2042
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,740
convergence of cyber with nuclear and I

2043
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:41,780
think that's something we haven't

2044
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:45,740
touched yet and that is the use of cyber

2045
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:47,929
capabilities really to target nuclear

2046
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:50,059
missile sites and what this means really

2047
01:24:47,930 --> 01:24:52,010
for nuclear strategic stability across

2048
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:53,540
the world I think it's just the

2049
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:55,100
beginning of what we saw a few weeks ago

2050
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:57,680
with the revelations of the New York

2051
01:24:55,100 --> 01:24:59,450
Times left launched operations I North

2052
01:24:57,680 --> 01:25:01,160
Korea and that's something really that I

2053
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:03,530
think needs to go out in the public and

2054
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:05,900
needs to be studied thoroughly yeah in

2055
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:07,849
the are classified level yeah so right

2056
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:09,559
now this is something of study at the

2057
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:11,570
Air Force Research Lab at the classified

2058
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:15,170
level they've initiated a program to

2059
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:17,090
look at the future of networked nuclear

2060
01:25:15,170 --> 01:25:18,710
weapons because the theory is that you

2061
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:20,780
in a modern military you want all of

2062
01:25:18,710 --> 01:25:23,120
your things to be networked and looking

2063
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:25,639
at some of the vulnerabilities there but

2064
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:27,830
I think that it's a hugely important

2065
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:29,690
reminder to keep on them as a populous

2066
01:25:27,830 --> 01:25:31,940
and me as the media in terms of

2067
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:33,589
releasing the results of that sort of

2068
01:25:31,940 --> 01:25:35,570
finding to the extent that it's possible

2069
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:37,280
because we have to have a broad

2070
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:39,590
discussion about the interconnection of

2071
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:41,179
these weapon systems in order to have an

2072
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:43,940
informed policy discussion about whether

2073
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:46,510
or not that's a good idea so with that

2074
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:50,059
we've just about reached the end here

2075
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:52,850
this concludes today's main session at

2076
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:54,170
the global sec future 2007 forum but

2077
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:55,340
please don't forget the night owl

2078
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:58,100

future talk with dr. mr. david roberts

2088
01:26:19,610 --> 01:26:23,839
from the singularity University and

2089
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:24,800
Maria Teresa room that's the Maria

2090
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,560
Teresa room is where that's going to

2091
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,970
take place so I want you to please join

2092
