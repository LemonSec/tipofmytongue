1
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:52,160
I just say a few words why this this

2
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,200
content or this element of the globe

3
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,199
signages new one which is glob sac

4
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,800
future why this is introduced this year

5
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:03,050
and this is because security has been

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,449
changing it has been evolving it's not

7
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:09,560
security as we used to know it the hard

8
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:12,140
security the tanks the guns it is now a

9
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,890
new security security which includes

10
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,690
economic aspects which includes IT

11
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,490
includes terrorism in its different

12
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,460
forms unfortunately some of them which

13
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,130
we saw recently in Manchester so it's a

14
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,410
security which is unfortunately much

15
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,240
closer to people and it has much broader

16
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,460
dimension

17
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,770
that's why glob SiC future is supposed

18
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:37,160
to focus on those new dimensions of

19
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,990
security and to give us opportunity to

20
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,530
different stakeholders from governments

21
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:45,169
private sector from civil society to

22
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,780
talk about how we understand security in

23
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,560
this new context but also how we deal

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,060
with the new challenges that such a new

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,320
security and security company is

26
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,820
creating now this discussion is about

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,699
so-called navigating the fourth

28
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,279
Industrial Revolution when I was

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,310
Minister of Economy in salokya this was

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,669
one of the key issues we were trying to

31
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:14,540
capture understand and also try to act

32
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:16,760
on what does so-called industry number

33
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,670
four four zero what doesn't mean for

34
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,060
countries like Slovakia and this is very

35
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:24,280
much like Europe it's an open economy

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,560
economy very much dependent on exports

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,720
on its ability to be competitive in the

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,090
global environment which basically

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,820
Europe as such is very much the same

40
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,269
open economy the biggest trading nation

41
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,220
and region in the world struggling for

42
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:43,820
keeping its competitive competitive

43
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,890
position in the global environment so we

44
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,140
were trying to look at industry for zero

45
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,328
as an opportunity because there of

46
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,670
course threats which emanate emanate

47
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:55,400
from industrialization it is the

48
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,099
question about the future of of workers

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,140
are they going to be replaced by robots

50
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:02,690
what does it mean in terms of ability

51
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,239
nations to capture innovation and to

52
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:08,540
drive the process of innovation use it

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:12,260
for its own development from our point

54
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:15,410
of view our countries and Europe needs

55
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,959
to focus on industry four zero as an

56
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,700
opportunity to utilize what Europe and

57
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,160
this region of central Eastern Europe

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,869
has been always best about it was not

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,310
about natural resources it was not about

60
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,440
cheap labour force it was about the

61
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,260
ability of people to think and to

62
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,260
develop new ideas I was today this

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,359
morning we just actually was before the

64
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,579
globe SEC officially began it was there

65
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,790
was a discussion about how do we support

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,850
new innovative companies from Central

67
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,340
Europe from countries like Slovakia

68
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:51,859
companies which grew up started in in

69
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,620
this environment we have some successful

70
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,580
story like stories like asset but also

71
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,870
new ones

72
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,150
I don't know Bill I think know quite

73
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:03,260
many people although we haven't flown

74
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:06,260
yet the flying car but hopefully soon we

75
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,899
will do but also companies like GE

76
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,019
drilling which is an innovative way of a

77
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,540
very deep drilling which could bring

78
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:17,600
completely new way for for example for

79
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:22,729
oil and gas companies to to define new

80
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,590
ways of of getting their sources so

81
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:28,159
there are these companies which started

82
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,289
here they received support in private

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,220
capital or governments in terms of

84
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:37,550
startups but we still have a market gap

85
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:41,570
in its ability to develop scale up

86
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:43,850
companies so-called growth equity is

87
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,310
lacking this is one of the market market

88
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,289
webs we are at I think quite good

89
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,190
already in Europe helping companies to

90
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:54,320
to be created to start to be nurtured

91
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,910
but then most of these innovative

92
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,460
companies leave for the United States

93
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,410
for Silicon Valley or they are bought up

94
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,810
by Chinese although maybe there are some

95
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,350
Chinese friends here and we are welcome

96
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,150
or Korean over ever anyway you would

97
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:12,110
like to keep as many of these companies

98
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,940
European as possible and this is one of

99
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,430
those areas where we

100
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,719
need to do much more and is also an area

101
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,190
where for example European Investment

102
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,320
Bank is now developing a new program

103
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,620
exactly for the support of the so called

104
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,900
growth equity to provide more equity

105
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,240
capital to the to the private equity

106
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,520
funds and companies throughout the

107
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
center Eastern Europe and Europe as such

108
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,380
to be able to promote such startups and

109
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:43,010
to help them to become scale ups and

110
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:45,980
eventually eventually be listed and in

111
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:49,070
companies which can generate profits so

112
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,200
this one element of the of what we would

113
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,180
call Industrial Revolution it means how

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,940
do we capture innovation how do we

115
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,760
nurture it how do we make it part of our

116
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:01,520
of our daily life and how do we make

117
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:04,670
sure that it benefits people I think my

118
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,680
colleague Commissioner Mauro chef choi's

119
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,780
will talk much more about Smart City

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,080
concept which we are developing together

121
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,909
with the European Commission and which

122
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,930
is also I think an interesting way how

123
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,160
they bring innovation into into

124
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,750
territorial level and make sure that

125
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,710
cities are also the drivers of

126
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,750
innovation itself I want to talk much

127
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,640
more than that because I'm sure there

128
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,580
with more opportunities to do it during

129
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,710
the panel discussion and usually when

130
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,570
I'm in the audience this is the partner

131
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,030
which I'm looking forward to to have

132
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,950
more more exchange of discussion ideas

133
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,650
and that's why I think we should have

134
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,659
more space for for our panelists to

135
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,560
speak and to have discussion with the

136
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,620
audience that's why maybe my last role

137
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,050
would be to ask Simon Nixon who is going

138
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,530
to moderate this discussion too to come

139
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,690
here and to to take over the role of the

140
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,489
leader of the panel itself but thank you

141
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:05,020
again for coming here and for being part

142
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,020

me was has a diploma in artificial

166
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:36,860
intelligence so so very farsighted

167
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,660
interest in the fourth Industrial

168
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,240
Revolution before any of us rest of us

169
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,589
had even thought about it and then Basel

170
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,460
Hudak who you've just heard from and

171
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:49,430
then finally on the left Martina Larkin

172
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,560
who is the head of the Europe and

173
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,550
Eurasia and sits on the executive

174
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,489
committee for the World Economic Forum

175
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:02,300
so if we could dive straight in on the

176
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,450
panel I mean first I'd like to ask

177
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,390
people on the panel what it is about the

178
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,250
fourth Industrial Revolution that most

179
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:12,650
excites them or the changes that they

180
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,240
personally think are the most

181
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,439
transformative the most interesting from

182
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,180
their perspective perhaps I could come

183
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,120
to you first off mr flibble anyof what's

184
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,699
your

185
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,639
from your perspective what most excites

186
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:29,309
you thanks Alan thank you thank you so

187
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,860
much well there is no doubt we are

188
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:37,649
living in interesting times and history

189
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:41,009
just happens in front of us and it's

190
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:44,309
very clear that if we are very honest we

191
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:47,249
should say that if you just look back

192
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:51,360
three years ago nobody would predict

193
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:53,519
that Russia will invade Ukraine if you

194
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,649
go back two years back in time

195
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,629
nobody would predict that millions of

196
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,249
migrants will be just marching toward

197
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:01,829
European borders in the very heart of

198
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:04,709
European Union if just go back one year

199
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:06,449
ago very people a lot of people would

200
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:08,550
not believe that brexit is going to

201
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:09,809
happen but it happens and this is

202
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,579
history

203
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,469
and the very big question to me is not

204
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:15,989
that history happens in front of our

205
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,149
eyes but the very big question is who is

206
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:22,620
making history

207
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:24,899
is it the President Trump or the

208
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,779
president putting or the present heir

209
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,509
dogon who makes history and if there is

210
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,410
one question to me which is

211
00:10:29,509 --> 00:10:34,949
unquestionable there is no doubt about

212
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:38,370
that and I can stand in front of you and

213
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:40,079
say very clearly that there is there are

214
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,069
people who are making history today in

215
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,998
front of our eyes

216
00:10:41,069 --> 00:10:48,170
those are dreamers those enterpreneurs

217
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:51,120
those are amazingly smart people and

218
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:53,279
those are those who run the new

219
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,620
industrial revolution and really change

220
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,559
the way we work the way we live the way

221
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,769
we travel the way we communicate not in

222
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,439
years but in hours those people really

223
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:06,689
make history it's unbelievable if you

224
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:09,209
look back 10 years ago where we were and

225
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:10,920
we are now but it's even more

226
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,689
unbelievable where will we be in ten

227
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,729
years in the future for example recently

228
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:17,579
I talked to the vice president of Google

229
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,069
responsible for quantum computing before

230
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,809
that I talked to HP and IBM people

231
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:24,360
responsible for content computing

232
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:26,579
they're telling me the investing heavily

233
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,210
into this segment of the new Industrial

234
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:30,569
Revolution

235
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:33,800
and they expect that ten years down the

236
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,870
road a future smartphone will be having

237
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,290
the whole computing power of the world

238
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,910
today just in one smartphone so you can

239
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,689
imagine what kind of application is

240
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,219
going to be run and what unlimited

241
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:51,000
horizon for new innovation is just

242
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:53,430
coming so to make it very clear in the

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,310
next 10 years everything is going to

244
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,630
change the way we travel the way we work

245
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:03,839
the way we learn the way we communicate

246
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:06,330
call it artificial intelligence call it

247
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:11,190
Internet of Things call it quantum

248
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:14,670
computing it's coming and it's coming

249
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,580
very fast and it is up for me I was not

250
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:20,699
just a politician a minister president

251
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:27,540
but I was also a interpreter I'm an

252
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:29,970
engineer and it's up to me what is very

253
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:34,410
exciting but you're also very very

254
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:36,450
they're very careful to be debated and

255
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,089
I'm so grateful that we're here all of

256
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,820
you today and thinking about this yes

257
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,020
the world is going to change and I have

258
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,990
to be very honest with you

259
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,870
in this new industry evolution it's not

260
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,730
the politics who leads in this new

261
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,570
industrial revolution is not the

262
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:57,480
politicians who are taking the decisions

263
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,940
politics today is just a follow up but

264
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,780
it's not leading at all politics today

265
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:06,960
can just register what happens in a very

266
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:10,319
fast and dramatic speed and politics

267
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:13,140
today in many areas unfortunately is not

268
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,110
bringing solutions but is more just

269
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:18,150
registering and following up so the very

270
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,130
big question to me and I'll be very

271
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:22,290
honest with you I don't know the answer

272
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,120
yet I'm so excited about the new

273
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:28,260
distribution and I'm very very much

274
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,870
supporting trying to give all the

275
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,840
chances in my own country we managed to

276
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,300
agree with BMW managed to agree with HP

277
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,070
with IBM we're doing a lot of things we

278
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,620
are getting opportunities when using

279
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,720
those opportunities with the NIA

280
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,260
revolution but I'm worried and I'm

281
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,150
worried and excited worried about 1.7

282
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,670
billion who will be unemployed 10 years

283
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:51,740
down the road worried about one third of

284
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,199
the professions we know today which is

285
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,570
not going to exist in ten years worried

286
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,210
if politicians five to ten years down

287
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,180
the road will address and find

288
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,830
sustainable solutions for a new process

289
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,420
for a new industry revolution that is

290
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,880
going to question our ability as

291
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,680
politicians not as interpreters as

292
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,160
politicians to find sustainable

293
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,180
solutions so that this process is going

294
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:20,600
to be inclusive for everyone thank you

295
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:23,270
thank you thank I come to you now pivot

296
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,279
man group Algren

297
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,500
we just heard there about the pace of

298
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,240
change in the speed have changed the

299
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,680
great changes of the coming there are

300
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,720
particular changes that you are

301
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,699
particularly focused on that you think

302
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,350
are going to be are going to pose these

303
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,400
challenges for politicians and

304
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,850
governments that people need to be

305
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,370
thinking about as a manufacturer of

306
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,350
robotics and artificial intelligence I

307
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,560
make commercial drones for commercial

308
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,910
enterprises what I find interesting is

309
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,729
that people are only just beginning to

310
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:54,410
process things that we already have but

311
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,380
it's what's coming that's much more

312
00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:00,860
interesting so for example Elon Musk has

313
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,350
recently created a company which is to

314
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,390
do with neural lacing which means we

315
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,459
won't need a cell phone a mobile phone

316
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,779
to interface with the internet it will

317
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:11,209
simply happen through your thought

318
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:13,970
process and while that sounds fantastic

319
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:16,430
and science fiction is very clear that

320
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,170
we're not far from it now we're already

321
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,349
at the point where you literally swallow

322
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:24,740
a pill that is a robot which can conduct

323
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,050
a surgery from inside your eye so the

324
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,480
business of what is human versus what is

325
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,699
robotics is also merging incredibly

326
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,950
rapidly but I have to step back from

327
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,880
this and say as an economist what I see

328
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,279
on the landscape is we have we're going

329
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,779
to radically change the financial system

330
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,510
that we have in order to accommodate

331
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:47,810
this incredible change in computing

332
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:51,140
power and capability and I will go so

333
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,890
far as to say that what will happen is

334
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,130
we will abandon

335
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:58,319
the system of money and accounting as we

336
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,660
currently know it and we will adopt an

337
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,090
entirely new one and this has happened

338
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,439
before in history it happened in 1834 in

339
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,750
Britain when they abandoned the

340
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,150
traditional tally stick system you use

341
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,910
the phrase you tally things up because

342
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,829
they measured wealth and assets based on

343
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:16,140
a board that you cracked in half that

344
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,780
kept a record of every transaction in

345
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,670
your life and no one wanted to give

346
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,740
these up in order to move to paper money

347
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,079
which they did not trust at that time

348
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,390
and they ended up burning the tally

349
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,340
sticks to stop people from using them

350
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:32,460
which in fact is what caused the houses

351
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,140
of parliament to burn down in 1834 they

352
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,590
misjudged how much heat it would throw

353
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,900
off

354
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,900
well the equivalent of burning the tally

355
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,850
sticks today is to move away from paper

356
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,370
money and the traditional accounting

357
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,050
systems that we have and move towards a

358
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,760
new system and we already know the name

359
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,370
of it everybody knows the name of it

360
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,800
it's called blockchain and electronic

361
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,690
money can now be introduced literally in

362
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,099
a matter of weeks as we have seen in

363
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:59,070
India where they move 2 billion people

364
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,920
off of paper money onto electronic money

365
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,830
with absolutely no warning and completed

366
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,490
the entire task in about 6 weeks so I

367
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:12,480
personally see a dramatic change in how

368
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,609
we do economics where every activity in

369
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,250
the economy is automatically recorded in

370
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:19,439
the cloud there won't be a need for a

371
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,359
tax system you will literally just

372
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,550
didactic to dig up the tax at the point

373
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,379
of transaction so suddenly the whole

374
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,198
notion of a black economy entirely

375
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,620
disappears it changes the way you

376
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,210
finance innovation but I'll go a step

377
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,110
further and say it's going to have

378
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,970
enormous implications for defense and as

379
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,060
a person who advises ministries of

380
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:44,550
Defense one thing I see which I find

381
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,860
extraordinary is that we have all these

382
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,659
very sophisticated weapon systems that

383
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:53,100
are about to become infinitely more

384
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:56,580
sophisticated much faster and yet we're

385
00:17:53,100 --> 00:18:01,500
incredibly vulnerable to any breakdown

386
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:03,570
in electricity sat-nav Wi-Fi I find it

387
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,440
very interesting that the only military

388
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:07,050
in the world that

389
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,500
systematically trains without any access

390
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:13,980
to electricity sat-nav Wi-Fi or any

391
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,690
other electronics are the Chinese and I

392
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,090
think we need to think about what

393
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,520
vulnerabilities we build by becoming

394
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,250
ever more dependent on highly highly

395
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,310
sophisticated systems and finally what

396
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:29,580
it means for public policy making timing

397
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:31,590
my father was the adviser to John F

398
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,850
Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis

399
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,760
he was in charge of the missile

400
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:38,669
trajectories at that time they had 10

401
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,830
days in an era of hypersonic weapons you

402
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,410
don't have 10 days so we have to think

403
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:46,710
about the speed at which government as

404
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,360
you say can innovate itself to keep up

405
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,120
with what's happening on the

406
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,699
technological front you know in my small

407
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,360
world of manufacturing drones I see

408
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:00,030
companies saving as much as 30% in from

409
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,679
day one on their costs this is a

410
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:05,010
fraction of what is to come

411
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,540
so I'm extremely optimistic about what

412
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,490
the fourth Industrial Revolution means

413
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,010
I'll say one last thing I'm I'll take

414
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:14,180
the opposite side from you sir about the

415
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:17,280
unemployed I personally am as a

416
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:20,340
manufacturer of these things I am very

417
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:25,080
optimistic for employment in the future

418
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,929
I think that we should not delight in

419
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:31,169
having human beings engaged in manual

420
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,820
labor we should free up human capital

421
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,630
from having to do stupid things like

422
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,700
lift heavy stuff and free it to do much

423
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,320
more creative things now will that

424
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,590
require a change in how our education

425
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,290
systems work absolutely but guess what

426
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,399
it's already happened I mean we now can

427
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:52,350
access lifetime education so easily

428
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,560
millions of ways in which you can access

429
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:58,080
the world's best teaching so we are

430
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,000
better equipped than ever to handle the

431
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,939
transition from human beings doing

432
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,800
manual labor to human beings doing much

433
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,810
more innovative creative things as a

434
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,389
function of this incredible fourth

435
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,580
Industrial Revolution thank you very

436
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:15,300
much I like to bring that point so bring

437
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:17,439
Martina Larkin into the the World

438
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,560
Economic Forum Bob

439
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,510
I think lights have invented this that

440
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,340
the phrase the forth of - rubbish maybe

441
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,930
there were other others will claim

442
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,889
you've probably trademarked it no doubt

443
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:32,680
but but but vote from the but it is it

444
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:34,390
is a subject that well the web has been

445
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:38,560
discussing for some time we've heard

446
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:40,540
here now about various different risks a

447
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,110
bit of a dispute on the panel as to

448
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,760
whether you know the whether

449
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,560
unemployment is mass unemployment is one

450
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,400
that's just what's your work how do you

451
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:54,100
see the risks and the opportunities from

452
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,820
from the fourth revolution so I would

453
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,810
say since you know as with all

454
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,610
industrial revolutions or all

455
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,490
revolutions they they have the huge

456
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:06,129
potentials and usually rise you know

457
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,930
global income levels but also improve

458
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,150
quality of life and certainly we've seen

459
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:13,810
this and there's a huge potential around

460
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:17,970
this but at the same time it's also has

461
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:20,919
the risk to really increase the

462
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,350
inequalities we already have seen rising

463
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,080
inequalities across various continents

464
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:29,050
Europe also very specifically in the

465
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,699
u.s. of course and this new revolution

466
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,879
has the potential to bite in this gap

467
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:36,280
even further I'm perhaps less optimistic

468
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,610
about the outlook on the employment I

469
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,080
think we are about you know to see two

470
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,479
different scenarios and I'm not sure

471
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,000
which one we will prevail I think it

472
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,010
will depend very much on how we will act

473
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,920
in the next you know a few years or

474
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,480
month to get this on the right track and

475
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,970
to make sure that we have the right

476
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,590
future and we don't become the slaves of

477
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,510
the technology of these developments but

478
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,830
really take it as an opportunity and

479
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:02,980
really fully explore all the

480
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,720
opportunities certainly we'll see a lot

481
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,660
of long term gains in efficiency in

482
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,250
productivity but it also will you know

483
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,890
have huge demands on governments and

484
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:13,870
other actors of society in terms of how

485
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,470
do you enable and empower people how do

486
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,820
you deal with citizens that feel have

487
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,420
access to much more information that

488
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,610
feel they they want to be part of the

489
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:27,280
decision-making process in a much more

490
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,899
agile way they want to be part of

491
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,440
something that they have never had a

492
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,330
chance to do before and

493
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,879
leader systems are definitely not

494
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:37,428
enabled to do that there is no way that

495
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:40,070
governments right now really can deal

496
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:42,980
with citizens in such an agile way and

497
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,689
have governance systems and regulatory

498
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,070
frameworks that really deal with all

499
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:47,960
these new technologies that were

500
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:52,189
mentioned already and are on the horizon

501
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,580
in an efficient and effective manner yes

502
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:59,929
thank you um Mara stuff judge it subject

503
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,980
to bitch so I think um before I contact

504
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:02,389
I was supposed to say at the beginning

505
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,799
this is this session is being live

506
00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:07,870
streamed live on Facebook so just to be

507
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,830
aware of that

508
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:14,809
welcome to people on Facebook or

509
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:16,490
watching the Marathi we've heard a

510
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,100
number of challenges but what from the

511
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,289
from the European Union has been looking

512
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,658
at these issues what is the what can

513
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:28,850
what can the European Union do to help

514
00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:30,289
societies governments countries prepare

515
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:33,500
themselves for these changes that are

516
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:35,600
coming I think what really needs to do

517
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,529
in a decision-making in a policymaking

518
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,389
is actually to reflect what is we have

519
00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:43,909
already didn't start 'add the discussion

520
00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:46,459
on these two mega trends the first is

521
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:48,019
clearly Industrial Revolution we are

522
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,179
really in the midst of the process which

523
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:54,500
always led to the big changes we started

524
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:56,149
with the coal steam the locomotives and

525
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,639
the printed press which certainly

526
00:23:56,149 --> 00:24:00,649
brought the new information to the

527
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:02,959
masses and ability to travel and to

528
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:06,439
produce more efficiently then of course

529
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,720
then of course later on oil cars phone

530
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,350
TV and now we are really in in the

531
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,529
process where we have energy which I

532
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,449
believe very soon will be abandoned

533
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:19,279
because we see how the price especially

534
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,889
for enumerables is dropping which would

535
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,779
be clean which would be accessible at

536
00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:27,408
the same time we will have completely

537
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:30,559
new ways of traveling according to all

538
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:35,830
our estimates that the number of people

539
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:37,668
the the quantity of the goods we would

540
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:40,939
transport around the globe would

541
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:42,710
increase dramatically and then of course

542
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,000
if it comes to the communication we see

543
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,040
that there is something new

544
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,980
every day what is the difference between

545
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:52,460
the previous two industrial revolutions

546
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,650
and and this one is the pace is the

547
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,860
acceleration and I think we are now if

548
00:24:54,650 --> 00:25:00,380
you look at the the typical graph of

549
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,350
which reminds talking about the the

550
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:06,080
sticks not statistics but we are in

551
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:08,659
Slovakia so hockey stick so we are

552
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,699
somehow at this incremental breaking

553
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,140
point but I but I see it in our lives

554
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,790
that where we are going through the

555
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,580
technological advancement we are before

556
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:19,550
it starts to go very very fast and in

557
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:23,000
many R's in energy in mobility in the

558
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:25,430
communication and also in the cities and

559
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,830
that brings me to this second mega trend

560
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,790
which is this hype' urbanization every

561
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:34,820
single day in the world we have 180,000

562
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:37,280
people moving into the cities in 2030

563
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:39,500
two thirds of the mankind will live in

564
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,970
the cities in Europe it's already the

565
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,040
case of course it brings a huge

566
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:47,000
opportunities you know economies of

567
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,980
scale innovation environment the the

568
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,200
quality of life and at the same time it

569
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,780
brings enormous challenges what to do

570
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,180
with the air pollution how to take all

571
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,250
congestions how to manage the waste what

572
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,400
to do with the water treatment and how

573
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,530
to actually make the the cities work in

574
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,460
this new environment so we see that this

575
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:13,010
is really intertwined and that these

576
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:16,490
changes are so fast that we simply need

577
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,860
to demonstrate new leadership I believe

578
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:21,340
that in this century the key feature for

579
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,870
the leadership would be innovation

580
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:28,060
innovation would lead the way I mean

581
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:30,260
even in a security perspective in

582
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,929
legislation in policymaking

583
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,790
and we simply I have to think in the new

584
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:37,490
terms when we prepare a new policy

585
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,440
framework what we legislate how can we

586
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,390
legislate in a way that this legislation

587
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,970
would be future-proof how can we keep up

588
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:47,450
the pace with a change in a way that you

589
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:50,000
would support the tendencies create the

590
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,530
necessary regulatory stability which is

591
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,630
so important for businesses and

592
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:56,110
investors and at the same time not

593
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,500
hamper that the technological

594
00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:00,280
advancement

595
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:02,720
this is what we are currently doing in

596
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,030
the European Union when when I'm

597
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,740
responsible for for two big projects one

598
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:09,020
is energy union which is really kind of

599
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:11,960
amalgamating all this change what we

600
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:14,600
want to achieve in energy what we want

601
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,580
to achieve with with the mobility in a

602
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,580
couple of days we are going to present

603
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:21,679
the new big package which should be

604
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:24,020
called clean competitive and connected

605
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,170
mobility because I do not want to have

606
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,550
any colored moment in the European car

607
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:32,270
industry and simply we have to innovate

608
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:35,169
and we have to really support this

609
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:39,190
dramatic change which is taking place in

610
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:43,160
this industry and we need to also

611
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:46,430
provide these new tools to our mayors

612
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,470
who might see as a new driving force

613
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,600
behind these dramatic changes because

614
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,460
the mayors are the first to address the

615
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,399
issue of congestion of their pollution

616
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,290
they have to deal with the water

617
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,990
management they are responsible for

618
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:02,360
waste and I saw it in Paris when we've

619
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,940
been discussing the the climate change

620
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,469
issues that the negotiations been one

621
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,170
very important things which brought us

622
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:11,030
very good result but for me the most

623
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,730
impressive been to other segments the

624
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,680
business leaders clearly declaring that

625
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,120
they recognize this is a trend which

626
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,210
requires long term planning and they're

627
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,870
going in in that way and then the mayor

628
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:25,850
so who really realized that big burden

629
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,070
and the burden will be becoming bigger a

630
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:31,639
bigger would be on them on the local

631
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:35,960
authorities how to actually adjust the

632
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,510
city's in in these new tendencies maybe

633
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,450
last example why I believe it would be

634
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:47,120
so fast and so again it's very human I

635
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:51,500
was in in Katowice a week ago and I went

636
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,719
there because I knew how sensitive all

637
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,190
the policies or the decarbonization is

638
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,890
for the people who are working in a coal

639
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,840
mining sector I wanted to talk to the

640
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:02,710
social partners to the representatives

641
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:05,629
of miners and to the local Parliament

642
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,700
and of course I was expecting quite

643
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,740
lively discussion as you can imagine but

644
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,990
what was very very striking and what I

645
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,850
understood that

646
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,390
something which would be really the

647
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:19,059
driving force in the future was the

648
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:22,590
introductory remarks by the marshal like

649
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,730
the the speaker of the local Silesian

650
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:27,639
Parliament he told me we want to work

651
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:30,280
with you because we don't want our young

652
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,770
people to leave this region because

653
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,940
they're leaving this region because

654
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,110
they've worried if the kids would be

655
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,940
healthy

656
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:39,219
they're worried because they don't know

657
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,740
if they will find a new jobs in the

658
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,990
region help us to keep them here I want

659
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,970
our reactaline people to live here

660
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,309
in Poland in Qatar we'd say in this

661
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,080
region and we simply have to help them

662
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:51,730
with the new business models you have to

663
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,740
introduce the new technology and I

664
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,290
totally agree with the president in need

665
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,330
to bring more increase in inclusivity

666
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:00,490
into this process because we need to

667
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,740
show the people opportunities and not

668
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,620
only I would say the adverse side that

669
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,690
the worries the concerns and I'm also a

670
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,510
little bit on a more optimistic note if

671
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,820
it comes to the robot ization I think

672
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:16,570
it's quite clear that all repetitive

673
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:18,580
operations will be done by robots very

674
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:22,870
soon but I think there are human

675
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:25,659
emotions sensitivity care creativity all

676
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:28,360
that what really make us different from

677
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,370
any other being on this planet it will

678
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,649
stay with us and it would be the quality

679
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:35,790
which would be in a huge demand and I

680
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:39,130
believe that we need to focus our future

681
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:41,530
mission also the economic cycles in the

682
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:44,290
direction thank you thank you very much

683
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:46,450
so I'm getting up to two vassal who

684
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:48,370
don't now but I just say well I want

685
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,190
this to be as interactive as possible so

686
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,080
after he's been shopping we become well

687
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:57,340
you know if anyone has questions just

688
00:30:53,080 --> 00:31:00,010
raise your hand or let me know so please

689
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:05,530
think about that while he's speaking but

690
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:07,690
vassal the EIB as you mention earlier

691
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:11,440
has an important role to play in terms

692
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,570
of helping fund pan-european investments

693
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,880
or investments that can can help this

694
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:19,480
transformation but what what what are

695
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,240
the sort of what are the key areas where

696
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,600
the EIP is focusing what are the main

697
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,970
areas where

698
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,770
the challenges that you see for for

699
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,860
Europe in terms of preparing itself for

700
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:32,590
making itself better prepared for the

701
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:35,750
for the fourth Industrial Revolution

702
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:38,330
yeah I think we all spoke about the fact

703
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:41,510
that for the Industrial Revolution and

704
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:43,790
the changes we are facing they basically

705
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,590
mean a change for all of us it also

706
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,420
means a change for institution like EIB

707
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,610
European Western Bank which is the Bank

708
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,990
of the European Union we are they

709
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:52,490
actually the largest multilateral

710
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:54,490
development institution in terms of the

711
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:57,440
volume of money we put into the economy

712
00:31:54,490 --> 00:32:00,830
last year we financed projects of over

713
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,690
84 billion euros 10% of these actually

714
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,280
goes beyond the European Union and we

715
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,230
are working very closely with the

716
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,060
European Commission European Parliament

717
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:12,200
people like Khatta meetha Nova who is

718
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:14,270
here from the DG near to make sure that

719
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,040
what we do is in line with the

720
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,889
priorities of the of the European Union

721
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:21,680
but basically means for us is that and

722
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,600
I've been with the AIB for six months so

723
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,580
I'm blotting the fresh in this

724
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,980
institution and I was before in

725
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,740
commercial banking so can compare the

726
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:33,520
two different different worlds the bank

727
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:36,980
has to change as well it cannot be the

728
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:40,040
machine for large infrastructure or

729
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,930
government dominated projects anymore it

730
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,820
was kind of easy banking as I saw it you

731
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:45,860
know give two hundred four hundred

732
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,100
million euros here and there and

733
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:52,669
basically with a few projects Europe

734
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:55,610
have a free time it has to change it has

735
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,770
to be much more proactive has to go down

736
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,649
to the level of mercy to the level of

737
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:03,170
cities we are now developing this joint

738
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,790
concept of smart cities development

739
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,190
because these are the drivers of

740
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:09,530
innovation of the growth these are the

741
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:11,420
opportunities for the cohesion countries

742
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,670
as we call them here in this part of

743
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,130
Europe to leapfrog in the wreck anomic

744
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:18,500
development and also for the countries

745
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,630
which are a truly small to be able to go

746
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,300
beyond the barriers of economic

747
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:25,400
development of the geographical other

748
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,169
constraints that's how we get countries

749
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,980
like Estonia to be the leaders of

750
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:33,370
government to produce such companies as

751
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:37,320
skype with less than 2 million people

752
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:41,189
population so the IP has to change

753
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:43,560
and we are changing we also changing

754
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:49,260
thanks to the new instruments such as

755
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:51,270
you airplane this is a new basically new

756
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,610
opportunity financing opportunity for

757
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:56,160
especially for the innovations and for

758
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:58,860
energy efficiency we are implementing

759
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,150
the projects which are eventually

760
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,250
supposed to bring

761
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:05,700
total investment over over 300 million

762
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:08,489
billion billion euros by the end of 2018

763
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,310
and we should make European economy much

764
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:13,859
more competitive we are developing

765
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,989
so-called advisory hubs which are local

766
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:19,200
advisory hubs in countries like Slovakia

767
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:21,629
or hungry or Bulgaria to make sure that

768
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:24,540
the local entrepreneurs have the ability

769
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:27,090
to access finding from AIB so it's not

770
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:29,520
just a bank for the for the big

771
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,980
governments and what is very important

772
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,710
for us is the additionality we are a

773
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,199
public banking institution so we are

774
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,330
supposed to crowd in private sector

775
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,089
investment we are supposed to take the

776
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:43,590
risk in the areas there for example

777
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:46,110
commercial banks are not going or not

778
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:48,179
ready to go yet we are also giving the

779
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:50,669
private commercial banks opportunity to

780
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:54,450
be more risk risky by for example giving

781
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:57,480
them guarantees for them some some part

782
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:59,370
of the portfolio to be able to to go and

783
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,310
lend more money to the small and medium

784
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:05,970
enterprises and we are additional in

785
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:08,730
terms of bringing I would say broader

786
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:11,700
horizontal type of development so that

787
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:14,970
smart cities can drive not only cities

788
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,200
but also smart villages because for

789
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:18,600
example here in Slovakia it's very

790
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,049
important that the villages don't get

791
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,970
empty that rural development gets as

792
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,370
much attention as as the urban

793
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,410
development and I think this is part of

794
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,210
the role that public banks like you

795
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:32,759
should have in the future and we are

796
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:36,240
moving in this direction thank you just

797
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,100
a technical question for me that we've

798
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,189
heard a lot about the the disruption

799
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,420
that's coming in and how difficult it is

800
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,860
that the world is going to change so

801
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,290
much in five or ten years and yet the

802
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,330
EIB is investing in very long term

803
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,430
projects and trying to crowd in private

804
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,180
investment are you seeing any reluctance

805
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:53,509
from

806
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,980
an investment to come in are you seeing

807
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,859
people you know is there any evidence

808
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,450
that the private sector is so worried

809
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:04,500
about the speed of transformation that

810
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:07,470
they can't invest or a you you unable to

811
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,290
forecast forward or is it you know what

812
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,660
how's that you just explained how how

813
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:17,430
the financial markets are seeing these

814
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:19,649
issues well certainly there is as was

815
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:22,740
mentioned any revolution brings certain

816
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:25,829
level of uncertainty anxiety and so on

817
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:28,529
and this fast speed of change also means

818
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:30,540
that large corporations whether is in

819
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:33,200
car industry in steel production

820
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,550
metallurgy kind of traditional large

821
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,430
corporations are certainly facing the

822
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:42,900
fact that there are all these disruptive

823
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:47,029
technology type of guys whether it's

824
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,920
Airbnb whether it's uber I was amazed

825
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:53,849
recently there was a data information

826
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,220
saying that Tesla car capitalization is

827
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:58,650
not bigger than I think fourth car my

828
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,020
goodness who could imagine and you

829
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:04,290
basically recently start-up is suddenly

830
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,990
more capitalized in the old stable and

831
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:09,859
big manufacturing car manufacturing so

832
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:14,339
yes we are saying some level of anxiety

833
00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:17,160
some level of questioning in the capital

834
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:19,890
markets whether long-term financing for

835
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,720
a certain type of companies especially

836
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:24,569
in the traditional areas traditional

837
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,790
sectors is something which is safe but

838
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:29,339
this is exactly the area where AIB can

839
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:32,400
be a partner because we can provide this

840
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:34,740
longitude ET we can we can usually

841
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,349
provide funding which is is longer

842
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:42,509
tenors of 15 20 25 years and we can also

843
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:44,940
provide support to for example to

844
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:47,849
private equity investment funds so that

845
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,930
they can then deploy the money to the to

846
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:50,700
the local partners and local

847
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,140
beneficiaries so I think this is

848
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,078
actually very interesting way where

849
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:58,049
public bank European public bank can

850
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,620
leverage private money and mitigate some

851
00:37:58,049 --> 00:38:03,170
of the risks that they see from the tea

852
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:09,140
kind of private financial sector point

853
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:11,090
of view one more aspect of it because as

854
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,520
already described it very well but what

855
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:15,200
was also one of the driving moments when

856
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,090
we came up with the idea of you can

857
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,000
investment fund was the fact that we've

858
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:22,370
been after the big economic crisis where

859
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,910
the Europe was heavily under invested

860
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:28,100
and we see it on our infrastructure

861
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:30,230
almost you know in all our member states

862
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,819
including Germany I'm using the highways

863
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:34,700
quite often and I mean you could clearly

864
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,920
see that even there you need the

865
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,450
investment in infrastructure and

866
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,010
suddenly the infrastructure which is

867
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,169
visible you need much stronger

868
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:44,720
infrastructure for the digital means of

869
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:48,860
communication and and because of the

870
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,259
limited possibilities for the public

871
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,660
investment and public budgets we ended

872
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:57,950
up in a situation that we had actually

873
00:38:53,660 --> 00:39:00,170
the lots of cash in the banks very

874
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:03,379
little possibility to fund many of these

875
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,990
important projects from the public

876
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,760
financing and we need to find a way how

877
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,649
we can actually bring more of this

878
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,330
private money of this private investment

879
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:14,210
to support these transformational

880
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:16,220
projects and therefore we came up with

881
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:20,000
that idea and I would like to thank EIB

882
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:22,819
for being so cooperative on days that we

883
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,910
will develop a little bit the business

884
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:29,660
model in a way by showing the private

885
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:31,460
sector that V is a EU lets simplified we

886
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:34,460
are going into this project together

887
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:38,480
with you we are ready to take the

888
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:42,860
eventual first loss risk you go with us

889
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:46,160
you can invest and you could be s risk

890
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:48,230
free as you can be in this in this

891
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,569
banking world because such respecting

892
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:52,310
institution as the EAB is your partner

893
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:55,010
and of course the Commission is going to

894
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:57,529
assess the project as well and I have to

895
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:59,330
say that they didn't know or how this

896
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:03,290
would work but I think every to leverage

897
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:06,020
is what now take 1 to 15 in the most of

898
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:09,200
them 1 to 15 around 1 to 15 so 1 for 1

899
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,880
euro the of the public seed money we get

900
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,140
15 euros from the private investors and

901
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,260
I think that said that's a great result

902
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:17,020
and I think that would be very much used

903
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:19,860
in in the future and currently I think

904
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:23,370
thanks to this new scheme I think we are

905
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:26,110
mobilized the investment of more than

906
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:28,240
190 billion in a two and a half years so

907
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:30,220
I think that's a I think very good

908
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,779
scheme and which I'm sure they'll be

909
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,410
assessed how we can use something

910
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:38,200
similar in the future really fascinating

911
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:41,049
is that you don't need very much money

912
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:43,540
to do a lot of this innovation I mean

913
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:46,930
I'm right in this robotic space and it's

914
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:50,410
not capital intensive the fact that your

915
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:53,040
iPhone has more computing power than was

916
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:55,930
required to do the lunar mission to Mars

917
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,370
means we're all empowered to do

918
00:40:55,930 --> 00:41:00,609
extraordinary things

919
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:01,839
with actually not much cash and that

920
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,090
goes to solving some of the problems

921
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,860
that matter for the strategic security

922
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,720
world I keep coming back to this because

923
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:11,170
that's the main focus here but as a

924
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,109
small example one of the things I see as

925
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:17,050
an economist is the major driver behind

926
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:20,320
China's one belt one road strategy a

927
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:23,320
major driver between behind Russia's arc

928
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,060
of Steel strategic security strategy has

929
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:27,310
to do with their insecurities about

930
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:29,890
access to food but we live in a world

931
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:33,370
where the MIT Media Lab has already

932
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:35,230
created food production technology where

933
00:41:33,370 --> 00:41:37,839
you can literally grow any kind of

934
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:40,420
produce you want in a container like you

935
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,430
use on a container ship and you can do

936
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:45,240
it with virtually no electricity

937
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:48,509
definitely no sunlight almost no water

938
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:51,339
almost no fertilizer or chemicals and

939
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,830
they're growing it two to four times

940
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,050
faster than in the real environment with

941
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:58,810
higher nutrition and most importantly

942
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:01,780
better flavor now when you have this

943
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:04,900
already at your disposal developed by

944
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:07,450
students with no budget whatsoever using

945
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,330
open-source technology open coding

946
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:12,970
systems the application of this is

947
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:16,330
extraordinary in terms of beginning to

948
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:19,180
resolve the drive for access to food and

949
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:21,549
so I think this is another piece of this

950
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:24,279
puzzle is how do we operate in a world

951
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,350
where actually almost anybody can join

952
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,470
in this game I mean I look at this

953
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,270
audience you know

954
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,310
all of us are of a certain age it

955
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:33,710
probably is true that you have to ask

956
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:36,020
the 14 year old in your household how to

957
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,420
use the technology you currently have

958
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,190
but the fact is the 14 year old does

959
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:42,170
know how to use it and there are people

960
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:45,470
who are able to harness this

961
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,810
extraordinary capability for actually

962
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:51,230
not much cash it brings a whole new

963
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:54,259
meaning to financial needs for

964
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:56,510
innovation get to build up on what my

965
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,300
colleagues already said it's about the

966
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,310
private sector and private sector is

967
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,960
gearing up they had such a huge

968
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,090
opportunities with the new Industrial

969
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,410
Revolution and it's not just the German

970
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,810
and the American or the Chinese

971
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:11,149
companies it is also hints lavake but

972
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:13,340
also in my country we feel it we sense

973
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,109
it it's there it's a huge opportunity

974
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,590
I'm just giving some examples very

975
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:19,400
quickly

976
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:21,290
for example BMW is completely reshaping

977
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,700
the way they produce their cars in a way

978
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:26,330
that did not understand themselves

979
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:29,240
anymore as a car producer but as a

980
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:32,450
platform for mobility and a customized

981
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:36,080
solutions for mobility and we managed in

982
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:38,660
Bulgaria to organize a BMW factories for

983
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,609
the leather seats of BMW and minis where

984
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:43,549
in the past you had just three types of

985
00:43:40,609 --> 00:43:45,348
leather seats for BMWs at a Carroll

986
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,869
sport seat whatever kind of seat in the

987
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:52,010
future we have just 300 and all of them

988
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:55,609
have to be customized and this should

989
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:58,369
not cost more money but BMW becomes a

990
00:43:55,609 --> 00:44:00,230
platform for customized solutions and it

991
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,700
is the same for example I need as I just

992
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,710
recently visited one of the new

993
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,460
factories and it does it completely

994
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,280
reshaping

995
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,440
all their factories their goal is just

996
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,830
one thing they want to produce your own

997
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,109
shoe deliver it home without this to

998
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:17,569
cost any for the dollar more than you

999
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:20,869
thought its cost today so a DDoS is a

1000
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:23,240
platform so personal and customized

1001
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:25,160
solutions on shoes you're going there

1002
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,629
website you design your shoe you get

1003
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,460
your shoe in your colors and design

1004
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:31,580
whatever you want it is the same with

1005
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:34,790
the cars and this is telling us that

1006
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,319
factories and already twelve thousand

1007
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:39,500
factories moved back to the United

1008
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,210
States Obama our colleague was so proud

1009
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,270
when he was saying

1010
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:45,710
created 8.5 million jobs in the United

1011
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:49,009
States because of the Industrial

1012
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:51,590
Revolution moving back to where close to

1013
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:54,050
customers if you have to customize you

1014
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,910
need to be close to the customers we

1015
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:57,620
need to design their own customized

1016
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:00,140
products and this is happening

1017
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:02,270
everywhere and some of the industries to

1018
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,279
flourish and to come call them

1019
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:06,500
traditional industries but if the robots

1020
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,240
are going to produce more people will be

1021
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,770
going more on vacation so tourism

1022
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,859
industry is going to have a huge

1023
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:14,840
opportunity life industry is the biggest

1024
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:17,950
industry of the future just picking up

1025
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:21,470
it will be global supermarket for

1026
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:24,290
consumer and customized solutions in

1027
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:26,240
life and it is just the biggest industry

1028
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:28,690
in the future to come also linked to the

1029
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,390
new Industrial Revolution so it is

1030
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:35,330
exactly my point that private sector is

1031
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:37,400
gearing up on an amazing speed and we

1032
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:39,920
hope politics is going to bring

1033
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:43,430
regulations and solutions for this

1034
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,260
process to be inclusive and Systema good

1035
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:47,960
well you should come back to this the

1036
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,490
question of what good politicians can do

1037
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,750
and also what harm they can do in a

1038
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:52,390
second but a question from the audience

1039
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:56,960
up here peace you say who you are and

1040
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:59,560
again yeah Milo Jones are you Business

1041
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,880
School this is a delightful discussion

1042
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,890
I've been in Europe for 20 years how

1043
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,890
many people here are in a country where

1044
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:09,529
uber was opposed or is opposed

1045
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,910
I think you need to remember in the

1046
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:13,730
first Industrial Revolution the

1047
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,950
franchise was very narrow in the Second

1048
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:18,020
Industrial Revolution horses didn't get

1049
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,210
a vote about whether it be replaced by

1050
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,370
cars

1051
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:25,520
does anyone here feel that Yiruma Europe

1052
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:28,069
might be in danger of becoming a super

1053
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,020
cultural or demographic reasons might be

1054
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:33,470
in danger of becoming a sort of neo

1055
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,690
Amish backward-looking protectionist

1056
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:37,339
society what was I the only one in the

1057
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:39,890
first session that talked about the need

1058
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:42,710
for politicians to in fact shield and

1059
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:45,920
comfort populations from the changes

1060
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:48,620
that are coming there the automatic

1061
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,780
elevator was invented in 1900 the first

1062
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:53,210
automatic elevators were only introduced

1063
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:54,430
in the United States in 1945 after an

1064
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:57,490
elevator operator

1065
00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:00,759
like there's just an enormous disconnect

1066
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:02,129
between culture and technology and could

1067
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,109
you address that please

1068
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:07,450
right good I like that picture the near

1069
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:12,339
Armas you're up that's right I'll take

1070
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:15,270
that away yes at the front here we have

1071
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:15,270
a microphone at the front please

1072
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:21,819
European Commission oh joy so Drusilla

1073
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:23,650
games I don't sweep it

1074
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:26,730
Katerina Mata Nova European Commission

1075
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:30,640
DG for neighborhood and enlargement

1076
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:32,710
countries a little bit along the same

1077
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,440
lines matters you mentioned at the

1078
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:37,900
beginning hockey curve right I think

1079
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,710
that what you all described in a very

1080
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:43,540
very lively and very enjoyable panel is

1081
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:45,760
something that human brain is not

1082
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:49,390
capable of dealing with which is

1083
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:53,170
exponential 'ti and everything around us

1084
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:56,200
is linear and it took thousands you know

1085
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:58,599
several many many many long time many

1086
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,480
years too many hundreds of years to to

1087
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,339
get to the Agricultural Revolution much

1088
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,520
shorter time to industrial Internet era

1089
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:11,950
and now in a span of ten years the human

1090
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:15,970
knowledge gets doubled you were talking

1091
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:18,490
about inequality rising and you talked

1092
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:21,368
about and in this in the sense the u.s.

1093
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:23,229
is much more innovation driven and much

1094
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:25,329
easier to capture what you were

1095
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:29,049
describing but you also elected Donald

1096
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:32,890
Trump so you suddenly the the mega

1097
00:48:29,049 --> 00:48:35,859
trends come against politics and popular

1098
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:38,430
politics and the fact that there are

1099
00:48:35,859 --> 00:48:43,690
going to be the losers of the change

1100
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:47,609
whether it's the old people as so mr.

1101
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:51,010
pallone nearly as as a former president

1102
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:53,230
hence a politician what would be the two

1103
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:56,099
three things that you think are urgently

1104
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:59,619
needed for politicians and policymakers

1105
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:02,589
marriage also to do to try to bring

1106
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:04,990
these trends together because I really

1107
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:06,788
see completely separate world so

1108
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:09,698
developing

1109
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:11,949
and how would you if you were the

1110
00:49:09,699 --> 00:49:16,390
president now what would you be arguing

1111
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:19,509
for and from a policymakers perspective

1112
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,609
at the EU level does anyone else have a

1113
00:49:19,509 --> 00:49:24,519
question before we take these two great

1114
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:27,729
questions of the panel yes Peter Berea

1115
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:29,890
and I'm from ears from Russell's dealing

1116
00:49:27,729 --> 00:49:33,160
with Central Asia and my question is

1117
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:35,348
about a big initiative China is

1118
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,739
promoting Belden drought initiative and

1119
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:42,069
I listen to you I have feeling that

1120
00:49:38,739 --> 00:49:45,339
really in the future probably in 10-15

1121
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:48,459
years there there won't be so much need

1122
00:49:45,339 --> 00:49:50,919
for railways or this kind of huge

1123
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:54,578
infrastructure because many things will

1124
00:49:50,919 --> 00:49:58,058
be produced on the place closed to

1125
00:49:54,579 --> 00:50:00,819
customers and my question is really how

1126
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:03,669
the European Union your thing should

1127
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:06,069
deal with this kind of project in how

1128
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:08,769
what kind of focus on future

1129
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:14,049
connectivity should be the priority for

1130
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:17,078
us yes thank you okay so let's let's

1131
00:50:14,049 --> 00:50:18,009
just take these questions now maybe we

1132
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:20,739
could come to you first

1133
00:50:18,009 --> 00:50:22,650
Rosen since there was one directly asked

1134
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:25,209
to you me I did but it's very this is a

1135
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:27,939
important issues now how do how do

1136
00:50:25,209 --> 00:50:29,948
politicians weigh the sort of short term

1137
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:31,959
demands of populations versus what might

1138
00:50:29,949 --> 00:50:34,269
be in their long-term interesting well

1139
00:50:31,959 --> 00:50:37,928
you asked about three things I would

1140
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:39,519
advise politicians to do and the first

1141
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:45,640
and more important thing I will advise

1142
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:48,698
them to engage but really engage if you

1143
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:51,578
want people to believe you you need to

1144
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:53,349
be engaged if you want people to to

1145
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:55,689
trust you have a plan and to follow your

1146
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:58,209
plan you need to really believe in your

1147
00:50:55,689 --> 00:51:01,359
plan and today in the European Union we

1148
00:50:58,209 --> 00:51:03,939
are exactly there do we have a plan for

1149
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:06,609
the future do we believe in our own plan

1150
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:08,589
where we're heading into and how do we

1151
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:10,749
make the others trust us that we have a

1152
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:12,549
plan and this is the right one but the

1153
00:51:10,749 --> 00:51:18,729
very first beginning of all those issues

1154
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:20,470
is be engaged really burn with the

1155
00:51:18,729 --> 00:51:23,230
troubles with the problems with

1156
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:25,060
perspectives get really involved and not

1157
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:27,490
just because of Facebook and many other

1158
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,160
social platforms don't do it as a

1159
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:32,529
situation play because I'd be very

1160
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,049
honest with you 95% of the politicians I

1161
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:39,040
know our situation players but not

1162
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:42,580
strategic players anymore for many of

1163
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:45,820
the media today the day starts with the

1164
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:49,480
scenario for the day but it's not a

1165
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:52,780
strategic horizon of why are we heading

1166
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:55,270
into so if we could engage in a

1167
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:57,190
long-term vision in a strategic plan

1168
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:59,980
that really believe in and engage with

1169
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:03,490
it the others will trust us and we will

1170
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:06,760
be very very strong in in moving ahead

1171
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:08,560
and also once again businesses are not

1172
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:12,099
sleeping the businesses are moving very

1173
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:14,770
fast they use the opportunities and they

1174
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:18,970
do not just dream but they really move

1175
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:22,000
ahead on their dreams which is I'm very

1176
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:23,950
much I'm asking your peon politicians

1177
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,380
really today to come back dreaming again

1178
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:29,470
what was that dream about having no

1179
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:31,359
borders having sustainable peace how do

1180
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:33,098
you achieve that it's very simple to

1181
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,080
achieve it if you continue believing who

1182
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:38,440
you are and continue dreaming on this

1183
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:40,240
but first of all engage and engage with

1184
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:45,119
the new Industrial Revolution not

1185
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:47,379
because of some let's say populistic or

1186
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,660
day-to-day businesses but because we

1187
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:52,690
need to engage with this and after you

1188
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:55,060
engage communicate so that you include

1189
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:57,130
everyone and after engaging and

1190
00:52:55,060 --> 00:53:01,330
communicating I think it's what is

1191
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:05,130
important is educate politics to me is

1192
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:08,529
not about ratings it's not about power

1193
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:10,710
politics is even not about being a

1194
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:14,349
strong leader I am a very strong leader

1195
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:17,619
politics is like the new businesses in

1196
00:53:14,349 --> 00:53:20,740
the world to come is a platform a wise

1197
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:23,560
politician has to on the self understand

1198
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:27,220
itself as a platform for the ideas of

1199
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:29,380
citizens to flourish wise politics is

1200
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,730
being a platform for progress

1201
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:33,599
development

1202
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:36,070
not just leading in your own way

1203
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:40,420
hopefully with dependent media and

1204
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:43,859
propaganda machines so platforms great

1205
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:46,780
platforms as wise politicians the ideas

1206
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:49,240
education engagement in all parts of

1207
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:51,010
society within the newest resolution

1208
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,020
might bring a lot because the new

1209
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:55,480
industry revolution is also about health

1210
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:58,000
care is about tourism is about

1211
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,339
agriculture is about everything so

1212
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,050
everyone could be included if really we

1213
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:04,779
look at this process in this way

1214
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:07,690
speaking about China with our Chinese

1215
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:11,920
friends here in the room I am you're not

1216
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:14,310
coming from China ok so I hope there was

1217
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,349
one prediction about the European Union

1218
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:20,859
it's a nightmare for all of us that as

1219
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:23,140
we are burning into our own problems and

1220
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:25,660
dramas and we're just passing the moment

1221
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:28,569
and the road is not waiting for us one

1222
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:31,529
day will be just a beautiful and

1223
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:35,470
wonderful small part of the world for

1224
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:38,950
Chinese tourists to come in hundreds of

1225
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:44,980
millions and just enjoy you know for

1226
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:47,828
example a Venetia or deliver well it is

1227
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:52,270
not our plan with very ambitious we're

1228
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:55,359
moving in and a big part of European

1229
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:57,970
companies are also pushing the Fortin

1230
00:54:55,359 --> 00:55:01,328
distribution and even leading it so this

1231
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:03,549
gap as you were saying between Tech

1232
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:06,730
which is innovated and politics

1233
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:10,960
regulation that comes in your elevators

1234
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:14,050
example 14 something years later nobody

1235
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,490
has this time anymore and it's good that

1236
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:18,160
we have the European Commission here

1237
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:20,229
because the European Commission is an

1238
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:22,299
independent I the Germans have a very

1239
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:24,730
interesting approach they call it the

1240
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:26,140
four-eyes principle you have something

1241
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,569
on a national state but you have

1242
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:30,160
something above and European Commission

1243
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:30,609
even nation state is doing some wrong

1244
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,029
things

1245
00:55:30,609 --> 00:55:35,560
passing slipping do not working well the

1246
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,569
European Commission just send you a nice

1247
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:40,180
letters it's nice that we have this very

1248
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:42,640
good instrument of having four eyes on

1249
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,799
progress and I'm sure and I'm very

1250
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:47,020
optimistic that it's happening

1251
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,910
and last thing about the belt and road

1252
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:51,460
initiative I truly believe that our

1253
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:53,290
Chinese friends are very smart as we see

1254
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:55,300
for example an American president today

1255
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:57,520
who does not believe in the European

1256
00:55:55,300 --> 00:56:00,610
integration process who does not

1257
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,860
understand my territories Amin is not

1258
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:06,310
willing to support it

1259
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,890
well China is filling the gap big time

1260
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:11,020
in nanoseconds the extremely ambitious

1261
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:14,020
and actually the belt and roll

1262
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:16,030
initiative is also linked to really

1263
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:19,630
original development of a China itself

1264
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:20,530
the most undeveloped Chinese regions are

1265
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,660
going to flourish

1266
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:25,180
not just the others on the way to the

1267
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:27,190
boat and road initiative so it's a very

1268
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:30,250
wise politics and I think it's working

1269
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:33,310
well so we are just trying to be a part

1270
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:36,220
of this because we believe in in free

1271
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:38,920
trade and we believe in very good very

1272
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:41,919
good infrastructures platform for free

1273
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:44,860
movement of goods ideas and new

1274
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,630
industries to come take a paper guide

1275
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:50,740
brings you registered whether you think

1276
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:52,660
the European politicians are in danger

1277
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:55,060
or whether you know what harm they might

1278
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,580
do and whether whether they're going to

1279
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:02,200
turn Europe into this and maybe Musa and

1280
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:03,940
I believe an American as well certainly

1281
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,879
you can certainly talk about Americans

1282
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:09,760
it looks like it's safer it JJ yes this

1283
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,970
audience so I think technology is

1284
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,720
profoundly shifting the balance of power

1285
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:18,549
between citizens and their states and

1286
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,189
citizens are so much more empowered to

1287
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:24,850
build to create to build tomorrow's

1288
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:28,060
economy and the power of the state to

1289
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:30,910
tax and to regulate faces off the power

1290
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:35,020
of the citizen to innovate and what I

1291
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:37,480
see is that governments the biggest

1292
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:40,120
issue will be governments impede that

1293
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:43,810
process rather than encourage that

1294
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:46,509
process and in our economies industrial

1295
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:48,580
economies emerging markets two-thirds of

1296
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:50,470
the net new jobs in all economies are

1297
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:53,590
created by firms that employ less than

1298
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:55,919
50 people almost all the innovation

1299
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:58,170
comes out of smaller companies you

1300
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,869
Apple says we're not a big company we're

1301
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:04,140
a roof underneath which we have many 10

1302
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:05,460
person shops so this business of

1303
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,710
understanding what's the right balance

1304
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:10,140
of power between citizens and their

1305
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:13,109
state is a very profound issue for the

1306
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,790
4th Industrial Revolution my I wrote a

1307
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:16,799
book last year in fact on this subject

1308
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:19,049
arguing that what's happening today is

1309
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:21,900
we are renegotiating the social contract

1310
00:58:19,049 --> 00:58:24,780
between citizens and their states in

1311
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:28,020
every part of the world and the contract

1312
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:29,670
that you'll get in Europe or in parts of

1313
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,319
Europe will be very different from the

1314
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,819
one we have in the United States it will

1315
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:35,160
be very different from the one you have

1316
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:36,660
in China precisely to the point of the

1317
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,790
questioner from the back that the

1318
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,578
cultural differences are profound and

1319
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:43,259
will be respected in my opinion that's

1320
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:45,809
why we don't end up with the same social

1321
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,490
contract in every location but this also

1322
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:49,980
affects what is the magnitude of

1323
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:52,589
innovation in each place and maybe one

1324
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,510
mistake we've already made is to assume

1325
00:58:52,589 --> 00:58:56,400
that we should have and you often hear

1326
00:58:54,510 --> 00:59:00,150
politicians even in America talk about

1327
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,910
high-tech corridors high-tech locations

1328
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:04,589
high-tech cities my opinions we

1329
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:06,210
shouldn't have high-tech corridors or

1330
00:59:04,589 --> 00:59:08,490
high-tech counties we should have

1331
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:11,270
high-tech countries we should have high

1332
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:14,640
technology throughout our economies and

1333
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:17,000
accessible by from parts of society we

1334
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,980
should find ways to integrate people

1335
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,049
into that as opposed to trying to

1336
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:24,540
protect them from that so as an

1337
00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:27,540
entrepreneur I have to say to your

1338
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:30,180
points of you elected Donald Trump my

1339
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:32,940
personal view is he is almost like an

1340
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:35,390
uber phenomena in the political realm in

1341
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:37,109
the sense that he is disrupting

1342
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:39,720
disintermediating the traditional power

1343
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:41,040
structures he is his know whether he

1344
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,140
succeeds is a totally different thing

1345
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,790
but the people who supported him and I

1346
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,440
just gave two speeches in the United

1347
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:50,609
States for a thousand people who all

1348
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:52,980
adore him what they want is much smaller

1349
00:59:50,609 --> 00:59:55,680
government that is not going to regulate

1350
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:57,900
tax and impede them in their effort to

1351
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,730
build tomorrow's economy that's the

1352
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,609
social contract that America is leaning

1353
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:04,829
toward my impression is that in Europe

1354
01:00:02,609 --> 01:00:07,740
the thirty nine and a half percent youth

1355
01:00:04,829 --> 01:00:08,570
unemployed in Italy are equally starting

1356
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,399
to say

1357
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:13,280
this is a catastrophic loss of human

1358
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,400
capital that technology absolutely could

1359
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,560
put to work and we need to find ways to

1360
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,530
renegotiate that social contract in

1361
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,540
Europe that will facilitate growth here

1362
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:26,060
we should have a world where Silicon

1363
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:29,690
Valley is the tech place we should have

1364
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:32,000
tech places all over including all over

1365
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:34,960
Europe but to do that we have to have a

1366
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,390
state that doesn't so aggressively

1367
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,640
prevent businesses from being created

1368
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:43,160
and from innovating so it's a balance of

1369
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:46,009
power issue in my opinion that's what

1370
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:48,310
you wanted to come in on this I think

1371
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:51,560
very important question a question of

1372
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:54,799
basically whether Europe as a protection

1373
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,509
is the over-regulated and clave is going

1374
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:59,120
to fall behind the other parts of the

1375
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:02,060
world and I have to say I'm citing this

1376
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:05,720
president often means companies that I

1377
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:08,450
believe that that Europe will be able to

1378
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,879
move forward of course it would not be a

1379
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:14,270
linear process you will have ups and

1380
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:16,340
downs but I think that the pressure of

1381
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,759
people and the end of the day I believe

1382
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:22,040
that people have the wisdom collectively

1383
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:25,490
that they want to preserve some of the

1384
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:28,820
social elements of European contract and

1385
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:30,950
this will be able only if there is if

1386
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,660
there is competitive economy and strong

1387
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:35,540
economy in Europe to be able to sustain

1388
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:37,220
such social welfare that we have but one

1389
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:39,170
thing I want to mention is which may be

1390
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:41,810
interesting in this context this is and

1391
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:45,440
this is breaks it and I think that

1392
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:48,710
breaks it how not very much unpleasant

1393
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:54,920
situation for Europe obviously and any

1394
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:57,620
divorce is unpleasant but if UK wants to

1395
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,750
show when I think that any UK government

1396
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:02,359
will want to show that outside of you we

1397
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:04,010
do better than inside the U and I think

1398
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:06,890
they'll be pressure on the you to show

1399
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:09,530
exactly the opposite that we are able to

1400
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:13,279
be better and more competitive etcetera

1401
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:15,700
even without UK that this work shall

1402
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:19,640
create very interesting dynamic dynamism

1403
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:22,250
because in a way UK will be a mirror for

1404
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:24,500
the EU without the UK

1405
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:27,050
because I think the new government will

1406
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:30,260
go towards deregulation it will go

1407
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:33,530
towards breaking up some of these as you

1408
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:36,650
mentioned some of these old traditional

1409
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:38,600
regulatory political structures and etc

1410
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:41,630
and I think this will create a challenge

1411
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:44,150
for the you without UK to show that

1412
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:46,340
actually they can be competitive we can

1413
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:47,980
also change ourselves and and we can

1414
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:50,990
transform into something which would be

1415
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:52,880
lighter more competitive much more

1416
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:55,390
dynamic much more attuned to the needs

1417
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:58,250
of the technological revolution so

1418
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:59,330
however unhappy I am about the brexit

1419
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,220
and so on I think that there might be

1420
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:05,210
some interesting positive elements of

1421
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:09,649
this talk to Martina I come back to you

1422
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:15,140
Marisa because I before you can answer

1423
01:03:09,650 --> 01:03:17,150
on behalf of the European Union the

1424
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,129
various Chris we level a bit but Martin

1425
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:23,660
how do you how do you see the role of

1426
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:25,130
government in this well we certainly are

1427
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:28,279
seeing that governments are facing

1428
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:30,290
increasing pressures to changing their

1429
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:33,230
approach to become more agile to to

1430
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:35,930
really be more inclusive they're also

1431
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:37,640
being given much more powers technology

1432
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:40,580
will empower them also they will give

1433
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:42,799
them power to survey to do more

1434
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:45,590
surveillance to do own the sort of

1435
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:47,840
digital infrastructure the data all of

1436
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:50,180
these questions of course will empower

1437
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,860
governments also transmit and extent at

1438
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,299
the same time of course citizens will be

1439
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,800
enabled and will also have higher

1440
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:58,940
demands

1441
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:01,580
I believe that governments will you know

1442
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:03,920
do understand right now and all these

1443
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:06,380
discussions here and around the world

1444
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,620
show that governments are concerned they

1445
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:11,570
are acting to a large extent they're

1446
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:12,890
also willing to cooperate much more with

1447
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:15,050
the business sector with civil society

1448
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,750
with youth they listen they wanna

1449
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:21,080
involve youth youth is a big driver also

1450
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:23,300
for some of these activities so we're

1451
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:25,670
seeing certainly that there's much more

1452
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:29,390
dynamism I would say in the government

1453
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:31,250
sector we just also created this new

1454
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:34,020
center in San Francisco on the 4th

1455
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:37,680
Industrial ushion to help governance

1456
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:40,440
actually to navigate these new

1457
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:43,290
government in these new governance

1458
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,780
frameworks and regulatory frameworks to

1459
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:47,970
try and develop these jointly on a

1460
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:50,430
global level so not that France has to

1461
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:52,169
deal with uber and airbnb and then you

1462
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:53,730
know the UK deals with it and China

1463
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,530
deals with it in a different way but

1464
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:56,940
that we can have some sort of global

1465
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:59,730
framework for many of these new

1466
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:03,360
technologies that responds to the needs

1467
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:06,960
of the future of the citizens so I would

1468
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:09,540
say you know cautiously optimistic in a

1469
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:11,430
way but we certainly see a much higher

1470
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:13,350
response and much more positive response

1471
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:15,299
from governments around the world to to

1472
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:19,049
be an active player and future oriented

1473
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:20,400
in this space okay let's come back to

1474
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:21,810
the audience in a minute if everyone's

1475
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,540
got some more questions but Mara sure I

1476
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:27,540
mean I mean just a few quick words I

1477
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:29,400
mean on the nature of the transport and

1478
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:31,380
this Chinese big project I think the

1479
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:34,790
transport would lay hilly go through the

1480
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:40,350
huge transformation not only because of

1481
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:43,250
Buber car sharing systems driverless car

1482
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:45,270
but also because of the 3d printing I

1483
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:47,550
remember very well when I was at

1484
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:50,340
Hannover Messe how German Chancellor was

1485
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:52,170
proud says mr. president just said that

1486
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,200
address is coming back to Germany

1487
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:56,850
because they are going to 100% customer

1488
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,919
service and on top of it the shoes

1489
01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:00,299
surely manufactured somewhere in Asia

1490
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:04,380
because there will be 3d printed in

1491
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:06,360
Germany and when I talked to the mayor

1492
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:10,800
of Rotterdam they already now thinking

1493
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:13,050
how the this huge port business case

1494
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,900
would be affected because for sure in

1495
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:17,490
the future there will be probably

1496
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:21,060
importing different goods than now

1497
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:24,870
because most of the small spare parts or

1498
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:27,390
the pieces of the technologies or

1499
01:06:24,870 --> 01:06:30,330
equipment would again be 3d printed

1500
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:33,120
directly I would say on the plant side

1501
01:06:30,330 --> 01:06:34,680
or closer closer closer to the consumer

1502
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,660
so I mean this is something which is

1503
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:39,810
already happening and of course the left

1504
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:43,350
leg also such a big plans like one belt

1505
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:44,759
one row because we are here I would say

1506
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:48,180
in

1507
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:51,420
a good combination between the Europeans

1508
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:53,970
and Americans we had also in this

1509
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:57,660
conference quite a few discussions about

1510
01:06:53,970 --> 01:07:00,270
the trade between EU and United States

1511
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:03,000
and I'm strong advocate of having such

1512
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:05,280
ambitious agreement and I have to say

1513
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,490
that was not the voice which was coming

1514
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:11,700
from from Europe which she put is very

1515
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:13,290
much in halt I hope we can really revive

1516
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:16,160
it because I believe that it will open

1517
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:19,050
really a new opportunities not only for

1518
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:21,149
the economic development and increase of

1519
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:23,970
trade but also for what I would

1520
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:28,050
demonstrate is a global projection of

1521
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:30,779
the free and fair trade to the world for

1522
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:32,580
better respective labor codes for better

1523
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,560
respect for every environment that

1524
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:37,350
simply we would be able as a more than

1525
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:39,480
50% of the global trade that I mean if

1526
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:41,640
you produce your t-shirts in some kind

1527
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,960
of poisonous watered by enslaved

1528
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:44,759
children or women they're not going to

1529
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:46,620
buy it from you or if you are going to

1530
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,240
destroy half of the city because you're

1531
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:50,940
producing some genes we don't want that

1532
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:54,600
and I think this is something which we

1533
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:58,590
could do is the two big economies and to

1534
01:07:54,600 --> 01:08:01,410
be very strong on social inclusion on on

1535
01:07:58,590 --> 01:08:02,550
dumping how we simply measure what's

1536
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,170
happening and I think it's very

1537
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:06,390
important for the future because now we

1538
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:08,940
are in the situation definitely here in

1539
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:11,009
Europe then if we do not protect this

1540
01:08:08,940 --> 01:08:12,630
was the word which was probably they use

1541
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:14,070
the most frequently in the French

1542
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:16,620
presidential election it will be the

1543
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:19,020
same for the parliamentary elections so

1544
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:21,358
then we can in a matter of months lose

1545
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:24,480
complete sectors of our industry so what

1546
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:27,359
we would do we need to play for free and

1547
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:31,019
fair trade for social inclusions for

1548
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:33,420
clear rules and also for strong

1549
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,549
understanding what what that mean and I

1550
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:37,859
think that that would be something which

1551
01:08:35,549 --> 01:08:39,778
would very much determine how the people

1552
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:41,759
would also state and see this

1553
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:43,650
globalization trend in the future

1554
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,990
because currently I have to say those

1555
01:08:43,649 --> 01:08:47,608
who are well placed well educated and

1556
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:50,460
the good jobs they like it they can

1557
01:08:47,609 --> 01:08:52,319
travel they have future choice of goods

1558
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:53,880
and they have plenty of opportunities on

1559
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,250
the labour market but there is a lot of

1560
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:58,170
people for venting the angers through

1561
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,939
this election resolve in United

1562
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:01,949
sighs and across the day row because

1563
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:04,290
they're subconsciously for it what this

1564
01:09:01,948 --> 01:09:06,960
would mean for me now I'm in the global

1565
01:09:04,290 --> 01:09:08,339
market be like will I lose my job what

1566
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,230
will be the new business case for my

1567
01:09:08,339 --> 01:09:12,359
city for my town I mean that was one of

1568
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,709
the mobilizing factory United States I

1569
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:17,359
mean that's the issue which we have in

1570
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:21,469
Italy where you have the best educated

1571
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:24,319
young generations since centuries but

1572
01:09:21,469 --> 01:09:27,359
unfortunately in the wrong sectors and

1573
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:30,089
we need to work together with the young

1574
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,549
people with the students counselor with

1575
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:35,759
the parents and to tell them that you

1576
01:09:32,549 --> 01:09:39,330
know lycée is great thing but maybe if

1577
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:42,420
you if your son is or daughter is able

1578
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:44,339
to do something else they can even earn

1579
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:46,770
more money they would be happier than

1580
01:09:44,339 --> 01:09:48,509
struggling at the universities and and

1581
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:50,940
studying the subject very well have very

1582
01:09:48,509 --> 01:09:52,948
difficult to get the job afterward so it

1583
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:55,889
would require a lot of honesty stronger

1584
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:59,339
guidance of what would be better for the

1585
01:09:55,890 --> 01:10:00,870
for the young people to study and I

1586
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:03,270
think with the situation which we have

1587
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:06,650
with the youth in Europe we clearly need

1588
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:09,870
to invest massively in wrestling in

1589
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:11,879
education and to and to really do it in

1590
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:13,679
a very systematic way because we know

1591
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,190
what will be the skills of this century

1592
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:18,840
we know what what we need to know and I

1593
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:21,299
think our end generation is already

1594
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,370
pointing to what might be needed because

1595
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,460
there won't be better than we are but we

1596
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:28,199
need to shift that huge I would say

1597
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:30,120
machineries in our Member States to

1598
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:32,639
change the education to skill the

1599
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,290
teachers to evolve more companies into

1600
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,810
that process so that people would

1601
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:38,400
believing that the secondary school the

1602
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:40,140
universities would be definitely much

1603
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,750
better prepared than they are right now

1604
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:45,540
less frustrated and really voting for

1605
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:47,310
the future and not for attempts to

1606
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:49,410
protect something which is gone which

1607
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:51,150
would never come back and for which the

1608
01:10:49,410 --> 01:10:57,120
parents especially had the nice memories

1609
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:57,599
I think we had a question here yes thank

1610
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:59,760
you

1611
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:01,770
my name is Shivani and I am at Johns

1612
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:07,199
Hopkins University in Washington DC and

1613
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:09,360
before I first of all a beautiful segue

1614
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:10,949
into my question is what you just said

1615
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:13,139
about people's skills in the future

1616
01:11:10,949 --> 01:11:15,329
people skills but before I ask my

1617
01:11:13,139 --> 01:11:18,599
question I really want to applaud you

1618
01:11:15,329 --> 01:11:20,340
for a totally new take on the Trump

1619
01:11:18,599 --> 01:11:22,920
phenomenon because it's a totally

1620
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:25,440
outside a box situation which suddenly

1621
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:28,139
found an outside-the-box response and we

1622
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,940
nobody knows what to do with it but you

1623
01:11:28,139 --> 01:11:31,979
need an outside-the-box approach to it I

1624
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:32,759
just want to say that at our University

1625
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:35,099
which is one of the preeminent

1626
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,559
universities in the United States our

1627
01:11:35,099 --> 01:11:41,280
engineering school is really struggling

1628
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:43,949
to figure out what it is going to be

1629
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,409
teaching not in ten years time not in

1630
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:49,138
five years time in two years time a

1631
01:11:46,409 --> 01:11:51,719
year's time because everything is

1632
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:53,610
changing and I just want to have your

1633
01:11:51,719 --> 01:11:55,590
take on it no but you touch upon a lot

1634
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:57,150
of things I think you're right our

1635
01:11:55,590 --> 01:11:59,459
university is at the forefront of

1636
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:00,959
figuring out health and all that but I

1637
01:11:59,459 --> 01:12:04,110
want to ask you you didn't touch upon

1638
01:12:00,959 --> 01:12:07,349
the future of teaching education what

1639
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:09,420
the heck I know you touched upon it a

1640
01:12:07,349 --> 01:12:10,860
little bit but I'd like you to elaborate

1641
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,349
on that maybe Philippe but you have an

1642
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:15,119
interesting take on it

1643
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:17,729
I'm a European living in Washington

1644
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:22,499
today I have to say that we in America

1645
01:12:17,729 --> 01:12:25,820
are a little bit ahead but I like you

1646
01:12:22,499 --> 01:12:30,719
any other yes a question over here right

1647
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:31,530
anymore what show hands a lot of yes

1648
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,719
thank you

1649
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:35,880
Benedict Miller working for BAE Systems

1650
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:38,099
and to bring this whole thing back to

1651
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,590
security a little bit more we talked

1652
01:12:38,099 --> 01:12:44,010
about renegotiating the social contract

1653
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:47,659
and earlier Estonia was mentioned as

1654
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:52,289
being at the forefront of a government I

1655
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:54,179
think for a lot of young people when

1656
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:55,949
renegotiating a social contract

1657
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:58,440
you don't really feel like we're sitting

1658
01:12:55,949 --> 01:13:02,098
on the negotiation table for a lot of

1659
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:06,329
citizens do you think that investment

1660
01:13:02,099 --> 01:13:08,820
into more Digital Inclusion of the

1661
01:13:06,329 --> 01:13:12,780
society could be something that could be

1662
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:17,280
driven on a local national and also

1663
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:22,159
international level thank you any any

1664
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,159
any more we go it was

1665
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:26,290
well we're running we're coming towards

1666
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:28,060
the end now anyways so that's um should

1667
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:30,460
we take well start with pepper yeah

1668
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:35,110
sorry cuz I love this question oh and I

1669
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:37,420
actually but actually the Europeans have

1670
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:39,880
a huge advantage here because as a

1671
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:41,920
manufacturer of drones right you would

1672
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,030
think I go out and I hire people who

1673
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,330
know how to make them

1674
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:47,920
no no one teaches how to make drones in

1675
01:13:46,330 --> 01:13:49,930
engineering schools because they're so

1676
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,020
new until there's a textbook then

1677
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:55,360
there's no class and what I find is that

1678
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:58,780
I try to hire these world-class

1679
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:02,410
engineers they are brilliant

1680
01:13:58,780 --> 01:14:05,170
at math they cannot solder metal

1681
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:07,809
together they have never handled

1682
01:14:05,170 --> 01:14:11,470
physical things so I have a very strong

1683
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:14,140
view on this which is if we had more of

1684
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:16,810
the German style education system we

1685
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:18,580
used to call the gymnasium system where

1686
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:20,890
you have to learn your literature and

1687
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:24,790
your opera but you equally have to learn

1688
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:27,070
a practical physical skill and we should

1689
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:29,860
treat people with those skill sets with

1690
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:34,540
equal respect to those who have a white

1691
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:36,370
collar College lead path if we did that

1692
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:39,250
in the United States our innovation

1693
01:14:36,370 --> 01:14:41,290
would be much higher because so much of

1694
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:44,170
the innovation actually doesn't come

1695
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:46,740
from the classroom learning it comes

1696
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:49,540
from playing with things in a workshop

1697
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:51,910
that is where and I'm at the cutting

1698
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:54,190
edge of this and I'm finding I am often

1699
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:56,440
hiring kids who have very little

1700
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:58,210
education but they are great at modeling

1701
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,000
they've spent their whole teenage years

1702
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:03,280
playing with stuff putting it together

1703
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,510
so I actually think in this one respect

1704
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:11,230
the European emphasis on practical

1705
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:13,090
apprenticeships is very wise and we

1706
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,559
would see far more innovation in our

1707
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:16,230
economies I'll finish with this I wrote

1708
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,050
a piece on this for Wired magazine

1709
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:23,139
everybody forgets Einstein's uncles ran

1710
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:24,940
a repair shop and as a kid he was in

1711
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,610
there all the time and they'd throw him

1712
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:30,669
the broken toaster the broken radio he

1713
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:32,449
said hey kid fix that and his awareness

1714
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:34,820
of physics I'm sure

1715
01:15:32,449 --> 01:15:37,489
was influenced by that practical

1716
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:40,070
experience so that's another thing that

1717
01:15:37,489 --> 01:15:42,079
makes me hugely optimistic about the

1718
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:44,329
ability to include people in the economy

1719
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:47,299
that we currently exclude because we say

1720
01:15:44,329 --> 01:15:49,429
they're not educated that's because of

1721
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:50,989
the skill sets we're emphasizing just

1722
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:53,420
one last thing on your Digital Inclusion

1723
01:15:50,989 --> 01:15:55,190
as an economist what I see is

1724
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:56,719
government's how do they collect data

1725
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:58,669
about the condition of the economy

1726
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:01,940
that's the Federal Reserve collected yep

1727
01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:04,429
pieces of paper this is ridiculous

1728
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:06,949
we should have a digital approach to our

1729
01:16:04,429 --> 01:16:09,019
knowledge of the economy every time a

1730
01:16:06,949 --> 01:16:11,900
new business registers it's a digital

1731
01:16:09,019 --> 01:16:13,789
process bang it tells you about the pace

1732
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:16,070
of new job creation or new business

1733
01:16:13,789 --> 01:16:18,800
openings right now we got a lag of like

1734
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:21,139
nine months this is insane in a modern

1735
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:25,519
economy so the business of digitizing

1736
01:16:21,139 --> 01:16:28,429
does give voice I do think one good

1737
01:16:25,519 --> 01:16:31,219
thing about the populist movement the

1738
01:16:28,429 --> 01:16:34,599
election of Trump the event of brexit is

1739
01:16:31,219 --> 01:16:37,280
that every young person I know every

1740
01:16:34,599 --> 01:16:39,349
twenty-year-old every 18 year old become

1741
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,849
optimistic hey I'm Friday night could we

1742
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:44,479
come hang out with you and talk about

1743
01:16:40,849 --> 01:16:47,599
politics I'm like excellent now we got

1744
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:49,369
kids are interested in politics that's I

1745
01:16:47,599 --> 01:16:54,079
think they will come into this and have

1746
01:16:49,369 --> 01:16:55,639
more of a voice as a result a puzzle you

1747
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,009
want to call it yes briefly on this

1748
01:16:55,639 --> 01:17:00,070
point that Phillipa brought which is the

1749
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:03,860
importance of technical skills in this

1750
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:05,539
new new world and actually when when I

1751
01:17:03,860 --> 01:17:06,768
was in the Slovak government this was

1752
01:17:05,539 --> 01:17:10,219
something which was heavily discussed

1753
01:17:06,769 --> 01:17:12,679
and it was at that time when a strategy

1754
01:17:10,219 --> 01:17:14,809
of so-called dual education was adopted

1755
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:16,309
which basically means that those

1756
01:17:14,809 --> 01:17:18,679
students who are in the secondary

1757
01:17:16,309 --> 01:17:20,690
schools should spend some time in the

1758
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:23,119
companies to get these technical skills

1759
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:25,009
and and and the idea is to promote

1760
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:26,808
cooperation rosco close cooperation

1761
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:28,729
between secondary educational

1762
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:31,999
institutions and companies and there was

1763
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:33,709
also incentives introduced what might be

1764
01:17:31,999 --> 01:17:35,420
interesting is that some of us remember

1765
01:17:33,709 --> 01:17:36,920
the socialist times that this actually

1766
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:39,590
existed during the socialist regime

1767
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:42,380
because it was all socialist educational

1768
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:45,530
system is the state-owned industries and

1769
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:46,380
and they did have this exchange but I

1770
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:50,009
think that

1771
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:51,690
education reform is a key key component

1772
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:54,000
of the change especially in this region

1773
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:56,280
and I think the president would agree I

1774
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,650
see it in all countries of Central

1775
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:01,949
Europe of course it's about what to

1776
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:04,080
teach but it's also about who to teach I

1777
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:06,629
mean we need to create incentives for

1778
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:09,269
high quality teachers to go to schools

1779
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:10,830
and to teach these new subjects and

1780
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:12,960
bring the new skills to the to the

1781
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:14,909
students and unfortunately currently we

1782
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,219
don't have this so this is I think a

1783
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:20,549
huge huge change that we have in all

1784
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:22,770
countries of Central Europe great well

1785
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:25,170
we're coming towards the end so I'm just

1786
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:26,670
going to ask the speakers you don't want

1787
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:28,880
to come in just if they also have any

1788
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:33,290
well as answering these questions we'll

1789
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:36,929
also any final thoughts but perhaps I

1790
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:39,030
could go to Martina next time so maybe

1791
01:18:36,929 --> 01:18:41,190
also on the point of the education piece

1792
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:43,019
we do quite a bit of work we work with

1793
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:46,769
many of the top universities across the

1794
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:49,290
world and it's certainly one of the next

1795
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:52,920
big areas that will be disrupted in a

1796
01:18:49,290 --> 01:18:55,469
major way you know the traditional way

1797
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:58,440
of for eight years of education I think

1798
01:18:55,469 --> 01:19:00,600
to begin with which used to be sort of

1799
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:02,129
the job you keep for eight years and you

1800
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,840
go and go to school for eight to four

1801
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:06,150
years whatever will be completely

1802
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:09,060
transformed ably even and you know many

1803
01:19:06,150 --> 01:19:10,940
of our research areas show that the

1804
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:13,230
aspect that you always have to have this

1805
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:14,699
teacher-student relationship and you

1806
01:19:13,230 --> 01:19:17,099
can't learn from each other or learn

1807
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:19,199
from other aspects or you know diversify

1808
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,969
completely also have multiple tracks at

1809
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:22,379
the same time like the gig economy where

1810
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:25,139
you have different jobs at the same time

1811
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:27,719
all of these things I think will come up

1812
01:19:25,139 --> 01:19:30,540
and will really transform the education

1813
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:34,139
system entirely and we won't we don't

1814
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:36,269
even know yet how to do that in terms of

1815
01:19:34,139 --> 01:19:38,250
meat of what we see is successful

1816
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:41,670
certainly the apprenticeship model works

1817
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:43,199
quite well but also really you know

1818
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:44,940
driving much more of the soft skills

1819
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:47,299
also that were mentioned before and

1820
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:49,530
collaboration and creative thinking and

1821
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:51,929
problem-solving we're not necessarily

1822
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:53,639
like math or you know that sort of

1823
01:19:51,929 --> 01:19:55,409
finance or accounting which will be done

1824
01:19:53,639 --> 01:19:57,060
in the future by robots or by sort of

1825
01:19:55,409 --> 01:19:57,679
sort of artificial intelligent machine

1826
01:19:57,060 --> 01:20:00,380
learning

1827
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:02,480
thing I would say that that's kind of

1828
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:04,580
like from ours perspective something

1829
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:07,209
very very important to keep an eye on

1830
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:09,320
and help us at universities really

1831
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:11,030
revolutionize their own systems and

1832
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:13,360
their own institutions for them for

1833
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:18,170
their for this fourth in this revolution

1834
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:21,200
hmm all right so let's go mara she

1835
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:23,000
actually come in with some just just to

1836
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,700
sum up on the education I think it's a

1837
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,340
rather symbolic and I think it's a good

1838
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:31,309
conclusion because that would be the key

1839
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:34,400
how we would manage the these new

1840
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:36,800
megatrends how it would be preparing the

1841
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:39,290
new generation for the completely it's a

1842
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:41,360
new way how we would live in this

1843
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:43,700
century and what would be the best

1844
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:46,009
combination I totally agree with you

1845
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:47,840
that these technical skills are very

1846
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:50,330
important and they somehow disappeared

1847
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:52,400
from our school systems over the last

1848
01:20:50,330 --> 01:20:56,210
decade now we're trying laborious ly to

1849
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:57,500
bring them back and to increase the

1850
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:00,110
interest of the AG people that

1851
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:03,980
inquisitive nice that oat a playfulness

1852
01:21:00,110 --> 01:21:05,929
with the technical technical work give

1853
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:09,290
to you so we can also better decide what

1854
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:12,350
you probably want to do in the future at

1855
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:14,090
the same time I think as a father of a

1856
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:16,550
son who is trying to complete the

1857
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:21,380
secondary of school just these moments

1858
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:23,750
and I'm checking my messages all all the

1859
01:21:21,380 --> 01:21:26,990
time also I think what is very important

1860
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:29,680
to somehow explain to the children that

1861
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:32,090
not everything is on the Google that

1862
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:33,980
Daddy why do I have to learn you know

1863
01:21:32,090 --> 01:21:35,690
the day that the name I can find that I

1864
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:38,209
know you don't because if you do not

1865
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:40,280
know the context if you never heard the

1866
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:42,530
NAP alone existed could hardly you know

1867
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:44,840
finding him on Google you just have to

1868
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:47,150
have the basic understanding of the

1869
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,980
history how the how the world works what

1870
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:52,070
is the democracy about so we can orient

1871
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:54,320
yourself better and that I what I found

1872
01:21:52,070 --> 01:21:57,290
very very important third thing I would

1873
01:21:54,320 --> 01:22:00,860
say this was about the inclusion of the

1874
01:21:57,290 --> 01:22:04,220
people using the electronic means for

1875
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:07,730
that I think that all our democratic

1876
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:11,660
systems are currently overhelmed by the

1877
01:22:07,730 --> 01:22:16,129
pace of politics by the new cycle

1878
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:18,170
and by that viral possibilities which

1879
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:19,700
can destroy the politician in a second

1880
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:21,500
which can set completely on your agenda

1881
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:25,940
from from the night to the morning and

1882
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:28,010
and from the fact that the people now

1883
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:31,700
are living in kind of information

1884
01:22:28,010 --> 01:22:33,650
bubbles that thanks to the filters they

1885
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:36,139
are getting the information which they

1886
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:38,929
like they're listening to the statements

1887
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:40,520
they prefer they talk to the people with

1888
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:42,320
whom they sympathize and somehow they

1889
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:45,350
tend to forget that there is also

1890
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:46,820
another group but there is another view

1891
01:22:45,350 --> 01:22:49,930
on this at that point and that's the

1892
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:52,370
nature of democracy that always the best

1893
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:54,080
solutions the best decision been always

1894
01:22:52,370 --> 01:22:56,630
generated by the by the good discussion

1895
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:59,930
I think we need to find a way how to do

1896
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:01,940
that how to balance that information

1897
01:22:59,930 --> 01:23:05,150
flow and that would be very important I

1898
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:07,219
was in Vilnius yesterday there is new

1899
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:09,799
progressive mayor and I see that we have

1900
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:14,060
here the advisor of Bratislava mayor and

1901
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:16,340
he's very much talking to his citizens

1902
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:18,260
through the through the emails and I

1903
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:19,880
asked him aren't you over him by all the

1904
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:22,070
input by all the complete with the SVR

1905
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:24,680
we had to hire more people because if

1906
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:27,099
you do not respond within week or two if

1907
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:29,540
you do not see that there is a practical

1908
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:31,640
consequence of your of your statement or

1909
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:32,870
of your input so then you then you

1910
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,030
wouldn't believe in it then then you

1911
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:36,830
would lose the interest so it must be

1912
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:38,330
done in a way that not only the means

1913
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:40,640
and platform is creating but also

1914
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:43,550
responsiveness is there you have to feel

1915
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,470
that you make a change and I saw one

1916
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:47,060
practical or app which I very much liked

1917
01:23:45,470 --> 01:23:49,430
and I promise that I will pass this on

1918
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:51,860
to the mayor of Bratislava the mayor of

1919
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:54,680
Vilnius introduce the new app if you see

1920
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:56,389
a pothole you can make a picture you

1921
01:23:54,680 --> 01:23:59,840
send it to the mayor it must be fixed

1922
01:23:56,390 --> 01:24:02,150
within two weeks so and everybody can

1923
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,320
check if it's true or not and he told me

1924
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:05,239
that they are already behind the

1925
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:07,190
schedule I think in very Slavic people

1926
01:24:05,239 --> 01:24:09,259
need a little more lead in time for that

1927
01:24:07,190 --> 01:24:11,179
but it's something but the people like

1928
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:12,800
to do because they are included into the

1929
01:24:11,180 --> 01:24:14,870
process how to make this city more

1930
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:18,770
livable thank you thank you very much

1931
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:21,110
much so yes I present you of your

1932
01:24:18,770 --> 01:24:25,050
concluding thoughts thank you

1933
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:27,139
thank you if you look for example

1934
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:29,970
Switzerland there is very interesting

1935
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:32,250
statistics Switzerland is the country

1936
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:35,130
the lowest unemployment rate in Europe

1937
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:37,200
but also Switzerland is the country the

1938
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:40,560
lowest youth unemployment rate in Europe

1939
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:44,040
there is almost no young men and girl in

1940
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,750
Switzerland that is unemployed if you

1941
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,790
look at the European Union the statistic

1942
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:49,710
in the European Union now then you have

1943
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:51,330
five countries on one side of the table

1944
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:54,030
and all the others on the other side of

1945
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:57,269
the table and those five countries who

1946
01:24:54,030 --> 01:25:00,330
Ref have very low unemployment rates who

1947
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:03,900
have very low youth unemployment rates

1948
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:09,870
in the European Union are countries like

1949
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:12,179
Germany like Austria then work I don't

1950
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:13,769
know about Slovakia but I could adjust

1951
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:16,380
to three of them the Netherlands

1952
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:20,640
definitely and those countries are

1953
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:22,320
exactly those who have the so-called

1954
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:24,990
dialogues building system so the

1955
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:27,120
apprenticeship programs we in my country

1956
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:29,849
also trying to address this as we know

1957
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,670
if we don't do this we are passing the

1958
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:33,810
third the new industrial pollution

1959
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:36,990
factories are not going to come if you

1960
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:39,870
do not have a human capital that is that

1961
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:42,240
is part of the investment process so

1962
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:44,670
it's something to learn here in Europe

1963
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:46,650
and the results are overly seen but what

1964
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:49,950
do you teach children in the future I

1965
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:53,730
would try to teach them the right

1966
01:25:49,950 --> 01:25:56,160
approach approach if business is going

1967
01:25:53,730 --> 01:25:58,259
to become a platform if governments are

1968
01:25:56,160 --> 01:26:00,870
going to become platforms for ideas and

1969
01:25:58,260 --> 01:26:02,520
projects to develop we need to teach in

1970
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:04,220
the right approach and here I come back

1971
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,870
to my worries from the beginning

1972
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:10,320
President Trump all young people in

1973
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:13,050
United States voted for him marine lepen

1974
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:16,110
all young people in France voted for her

1975
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:19,470
and I'm coming to a major point for me

1976
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:23,969
where I see a lot of danger not learned

1977
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:26,400
lessons from history we can teach them

1978
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:28,440
whatever you want but if we're not

1979
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:29,849
learning from history history repeats

1980
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:34,360
big time

1981
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:37,330
protectionism okay we've seen that in

1982
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:39,820
the 20 century big time as a result of

1983
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:41,699
this there was a war and now we have a

1984
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:45,000
new protectionist American president

1985
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:47,769
what are we learning from history the

1986
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:50,500
new American president is saying I want

1987
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:52,920
to strike deals but to be president is

1988
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:55,840
everything but not striking deals

1989
01:26:52,920 --> 01:27:00,580
president is a moral compass of a nation

1990
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:02,800
a president is a visionary a leader so

1991
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:04,780
just to make the point clear because I'm

1992
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:08,920
also an engineer and I'm looking for

1993
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:10,659
solutions there is no solution to any of

1994
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:14,020
the world problems we have today on

1995
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:15,489
bilateral and if we have now American

1996
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:17,679
president who is saying I'm going to do

1997
01:27:15,489 --> 01:27:21,190
bilateral deals but just show to me one

1998
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:23,290
problem terrorism migration new

1999
01:27:21,190 --> 01:27:25,480
industrial Russia just one free trade

2000
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:27,989
that could be solved on bilateral we

2001
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:30,129
need multilateral solutions and

2002
01:27:27,989 --> 01:27:32,888
international platforms the United

2003
01:27:30,130 --> 01:27:34,860
Nations European Union a major platform

2004
01:27:32,889 --> 01:27:38,290
for peace and development in Europe and

2005
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:41,259
everyone has to use those platforms so

2006
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:43,630
that his ideas could flourish so I want

2007
01:27:41,260 --> 01:27:45,850
to thank you once again by hoping that

2008
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:48,639
we will be having the right approach on

2009
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:52,870
history and future thank you thank you

2010
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:54,250
you began by saying who's going to make

2011
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:55,719
history and you ended by saying we

2012
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:56,889
should learn from history I think it's a

2013
01:27:55,719 --> 01:27:59,500
good that's a good that's a good point

2014
