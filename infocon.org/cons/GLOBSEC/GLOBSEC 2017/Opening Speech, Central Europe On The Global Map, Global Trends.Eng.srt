bank of the Danube and you saw in a

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,960
short video that there is a headlight

33
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,450
the theme for this year glob sac is

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:03,209
adopting in the brackets to the future

35
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:05,760
and this is precisely the essence of

36
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:09,209
what we've been trying to do with glob

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,190
six in the past our mothers when I teach

38
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,709
students at the University they call me

39
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,709
on Darwinist in politics because I think

40
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,780
that the evolution of humanity is driven

41
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:21,930
by the same principles as evolution of

42
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,959
species and it's cruel but is very

43
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,720
simple are your adapt to changing

44
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,860
environment you survive and you thrive

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,220
or you do not and you go down the hill

46
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:38,430
the forum glob sac is one of those event

47
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:39,480
when we try to comprehend where the

48
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,959
world is going on

49
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,000
and to adapt to the future in terms of

50
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,090
what kind of policymaking with

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,340
industrial policies are what kind of

52
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,620
input from the think tanks to help the

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,810
process feels like all of people most of

54
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,209
the people think that the world is

55
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,540
getting into dynamics which is like you

56
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:05,610
sit on the merry-go-round and it's

57
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,190
spinning and it keeps spinning faster

58
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,500
and there is no handbrake on which you

59
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,109
can break any you know you get dizzy you

60
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,168
may feel bad on the stomach or what to

61
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,120
do you know truth is that world is

62
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:21,690
spinning at a higher speed and this

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,450
Darwinistic human capacity of adaptation

64
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,340
is at certain pace but when we come to

65
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,710
the point where the dynamics of the

66
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,849
world dictated by technological change

67
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,250
divers

68
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,740
too much and the gap starts to open this

69
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,419
can create serious point of this balance

70
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,840
and uncertainty and I think we are

71
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:41,370
precisely at that point where gap opens

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,989
the Sierra Club psyche is little

73
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,750
different because we want to stress

74
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,740
these dynamics and these trends so we

75
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,960
set up two stages

76
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:54,240
this is the stage maria theresia

77
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,060
which is you know in a coincidental way

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
symbolizing that we need the roots

79
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,840
we need to think of a past we need to

80
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,210
draw from historical experience this

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,909
year it's 300 years anniversary of

82
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,940
coronation of Maria Theresia she was

83
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:11,850
coronated here in town and actually she

84
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,480
was also a leader at the time of the

85
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,130
change

86
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:21,240
she was adopting the feudal system to a

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,370
new modern Renaissance thinking so there

88
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,770
was a challenge like we faced today

89
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,690
before but the second stage which I

90
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,210
welcome everybody to look at it's the

91
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,190
stage we call the future stages it's

92
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,440
about the futures not the future but

93
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,270
futures because you know how we behave

94
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,790
how we take the world there are many

95
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,799
possible futures there are many things a

96
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,410
lot of people do not appreciate enough

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,810
how technological change how things like

98
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,150
artificial intelligence communication

99
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,190
are the processes which we often with

100
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,049
horror call the globalization how these

101
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:54,440
are going to change the world if they

102
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,240
are not result by conspiracies by

103
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,550
whatever you know shadow cabal's

104
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,650
it's just given by the progress of

105
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,750
humanity of an end we to adapt to them

106
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,820
so I would welcome and encourage you

107
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,710
warmly to look at the second stage

108
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,380
future stages where a good debate will

109
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:13,280
be going on adopting to the future

110
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,750
cannot happen without everybody

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,849
participating and taking part and I'm

112
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,710
hoping that globe sake is a symbol of it

113
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:22,740
it's a perfect public-private

114
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,169

to your presentations and as we've heard

156
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,070
the organizers have prepared a very full

157
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,010
program and I'm glad that they've also

158
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,740
added a new element to it because indeed

159
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,770
we know that the innovations new

160
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,660
technologies information age and using

161
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:28,109
and misusing these new technologies have

162
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,990
become an inseparable part of security

163
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,380
policy these days where we stand

164
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,630
compared to a year ago to begin on a

165
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,820
positive note the yesterday's NATO

166
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,010
summit produced some good messages

167
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,530
especially the strong message of

168
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,540
transatlantic unity United States

169
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,150
reconfirmed their commitment to Europe

170
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,180
and Europe made a strong pledge to

171
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:54,240
increase its defence spending and the

172
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:57,329
new building is great by the way but the

173
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,280
general picture is not so positive there

174
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,230
are not many reasons to be more

175
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,300
optimistic than last year and if you

176
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,440
remember we were not at all optimistic

177
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,880
last year the Volt is not a safer place

178
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,850
continues to be full of uncertainties

179
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,650
not only future predictions are hard to

180
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,530
make it's more and more difficult to

181
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,540
assess what's going on right now the raw

182
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:21,939
power politics is still dominating and

183
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:24,429
the spirit of tensions continues to rise

184
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:27,118
far too easily we are sliding back into

185
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:30,009
traditional East less confrontations and

186
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:31,889
perceptions while we have still not been

187
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:35,379
able to resolve the long-standing

188
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:37,629
north-south paradigm in many corners of

189
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:39,779
the world anger and frustration is

190
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:42,819
boiling between the rich and the poor

191
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:44,439
mistress has taken roots between

192
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:47,259
political and economic elites and

193
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:49,779
ordinary citizens the Information boom

194
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:53,739
has been abused to blur facts and truth

195
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:56,409
with illusions and lies cyber attacks

196
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:58,779
are more frequent and systematic

197
00:09:56,409 --> 00:10:02,649
brutally attacking even the civilian

198
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:04,599
infrastructure hybrid threats have taken

199
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:09,159
the unpredictability of the conflict to

200
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:11,499
an unforeseen level chemical weapons are

201
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:15,429
again being used on the battlefields

202
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:17,709
almost with impunity and all these

203
00:10:15,429 --> 00:10:20,039
phenomena shatter people's belief in

204
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:22,748
government's and state institutions

205
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:26,470
placing Democratic systems worldwide and

206
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:30,459
the doubt and peace and the constant

207
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:33,489
pressure moreover the number of unsolved

208
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:35,248
or new challenges is rising with no

209
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:37,869
solutions in sight

210
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:40,419
European Union is losing its first

211
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:43,899
member which also contributes to a

212
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:46,199
global feeling of instability the new US

213
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:50,079
administration has to deal with both

214
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:53,649
expectations and questions alike new and

215
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,409
reborn powers seek the role and pursue

216
00:10:53,649 --> 00:11:00,159
their interests with clear determination

217
00:10:56,409 --> 00:11:02,409
and worse dialogue has become a last

218
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:05,919
resort instead of being the first option

219
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:09,579
to avoid confrontation and thus as a

220
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:12,999
result we lack common answers to those

221
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:15,969
many serious problems as if we forgot

222
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:19,059
that in our globalized globalized world

223
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,689
no state or even the region is able to

224
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:25,478
cope with these challenges alone in this

225
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:28,299
scheme I strongly believe the time is

226
00:11:25,479 --> 00:11:32,079
ripe for Europe to rise up with more

227
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:33,639
self confidence seventy years ago when

228
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,370
George Marshall presented his

229
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,640
groundbreaking plan

230
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,589
use one sentence very simple one which

231
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,900
was hidden in the text but it was very

232
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:46,470
irrelevant back then and I think it's

233
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,930
equally relevant today and it says the

234
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:53,550
initiative I think must come from Europe

235
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:56,370
and the US should only help back then as

236
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:59,490
we know it was more about economy these

237
00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:02,550
days is about politics and security but

238
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,810
the message is the same so I wish to see

239
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:10,979
Europe which is engaged and delivering

240
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:14,000
inside and outside otherwise every next

241
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,800
election in Europe will be a nail-biter

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,760
will be a fight between the pro EU and

243
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,469
anti-eu forces the migration could spit

244
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,060
all out of control again because let's

245
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,330
not forget there are millions out there

246
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,479
still wishing to get in the terrorism

247
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,850
will hold Europeans changing our way of

248
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,450
life and questioning the very u.s.

249
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,300
resident data the Western Balkans could

250
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,339
slide back into despair and

251
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,400
nationalistic nightmare of the 90s the

252
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:47,250
eastern partners will struggle to define

253
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,949
that identity and to find a place on the

254
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:53,100
map of the world the transatlantic bond

255
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,430
would falter the European Union's soft

256
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,400
power would fade away and the EU itself

257
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:02,040
might drift into irrelevance so I think

258
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,920
these are all very good reader reasons

259
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,430
for us for us to expect and support the

260
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:12,390
European Union to take its role as a

261
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:14,959
global foreign and security player to

262
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:19,260
conclude let me say a word about urgency

263
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,930
yes the pressure is in the air and many

264
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,110
are saying that we need to act quickly

265
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,319
and I agree to that time is not on our

266
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:32,550
side and many issues do require a swift

267
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,440
action yet let us not forget that in the

268
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,650
end it's the strategic thinking that

269
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:42,450
will prevail in practical terms it means

270
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:44,670
leadership and vision not just

271
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:48,410
constantly reacting to the developments

272
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:51,769
around us no matter how pressure

273
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:54,469
difficult the issues around us are hasty

274
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:57,889
or instinctive reactions are not good

275
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:00,889
enough we need a bigger picture to be

276
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:03,440
able to make a better SS assessment to

277
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:05,540
plan our actions and this is exactly why

278
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,629
we need gatherings like this and this is

279
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,339
exactly what we need people like you so

280
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:12,860
I wish you very fruitful discussions

281
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:15,230
enjoy of stay in Bratislava enjoy

282
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:25,100
Slovakian hospitality and thank you very

283
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:27,379
much for attention thank you very much

284
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,230
mr. minister for your opening remarks

285
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:32,029
and now let me warmly welcome at the

286
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,730
stage our president of the Slovak

287
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:35,990
Republic mr. Andrzej Kiska mr. president

288
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:43,929
please close yours

289
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:43,929
[Applause]

290
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:49,969
dear madam president

291
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,519
Delinda grabber katara which dear mr.

292
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,519
president Angie Duda dear mr. president

293
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:59,240
wasn't played nearly Oh excellencies

294
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:03,500
ladies and gentlemen it has been only

295
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:09,009
few hours since I came back from NATO

296
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:12,980
summit in Brussels this one was highly

297
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:15,410
anticipated not surprisingly it was the

298
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:18,199
first summit of head of states and

299
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:23,149
governments with the participation of

300
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:27,529
the new US president and let's be honest

301
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:30,399
in months since the u.s. elections many

302
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:32,860
of us in this room were worried about

303
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,730
what to expect

304
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:41,319
fortunately our transatlantic bond is as

305
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:45,170
strong as ever we stick together

306
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:47,889
regard each other's back the Alliance

307
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:52,430
remains the backbone of our security and

308
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:58,930
moreover we have a new lie on a board on

309
00:15:52,430 --> 00:16:01,189
Team agro all 28 member states are

310
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,099
determined to fulfil

311
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:07,190
their share of responsibility this is

312
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,900
also important for me personally as the

313
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:15,740
president of Slovak Republic some of you

314
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:21,050
may know that I have been very vocal

315
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:24,850
about the half-hearted attitude of our

316
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:27,890
authorities towards our NATO commitments

317
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,950
so I was pleased to announce yesterday

318
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,800
in Brussels that government approved

319
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:37,580
Slovak contribution to securing our

320
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:43,160
allies in the Baltics through so-called

321
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:45,200
enhanced forward presence moreover we

322
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,050
will join up fighting terrorism efforts

323
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:53,900
of the Alliance by deploying Slovak

324
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:56,750
troops to Iraq it also reaffirmed the

325
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,300
commitment of the Slovak government to

326
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:03,770
allocate more resources to the defence

327
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,490
budget last week the Slovak Parliament

328
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,339
approved

329
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:12,650
historically the first declaration on

330
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:16,220
defense spending and it underlines the

331
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:21,170
basic fact that our security is not a

332
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:24,410
question of political partisanship but a

333
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:28,610
matter of common responsibility towards

334
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:33,340
our citizens and that it cannot be

335
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:39,850
provided but by others but it can only

336
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:45,379
be shared our people naturally want to

337
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:49,879
live their lives without fear bin in

338
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:55,790
Slovakia Poland Bulgaria in Croatia in

339
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:59,810
Estonia in France but whatever resources

340
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:06,170
we spend on defense it may never be

341
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:09,950
enough to feel secure we need trust in

342
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,260
collective will leaving no room for

343
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,309
doubts that we would ever think twice

344
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:19,280
before coming to help you

345
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:23,059
this should be a clear message of all

346
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:27,860
leaders of our alliance to anyone who

347
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:32,418
would like to test us so on the surface

348
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:36,320
it seems that after turbulent months of

349
00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:38,600
full of uncertainty about the future we

350
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:44,649
finally managed to deliver some good

351
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:48,889
news I am NOT going to dispute it but as

352
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:53,450
some of you may know there has always

353
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:56,120
been some but in my opening speeches

354
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,870
here at globe sit this time will not be

355
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,449
different there are three things that

356
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:09,199
worry me and I would like to address

357
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:13,490
today first we struggle lately to

358
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:17,360
maintain institutions of the West be it

359
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:19,880
NATO or the EU as fellowship of truly

360
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,770
democratic countries base and common

361
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:29,539
values second we allowed the enemies of

362
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:32,740
the free world to get into our heads to

363
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:36,770
matter too much in our own affairs and

364
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:41,260
third we let our elections to be

365
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:45,559
deformed into a survival game of our

366
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:48,200
democratic destiny so let me level

367
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:54,340
elaborate a bit more on the first point

368
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:58,760
I want to stress this the vest is not

369
00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:04,120
only a geographic concept the modern

370
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:08,450
West is decades old and value-based

371
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:11,330
partnership with NATO and the EU being

372
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:13,179
the two institutions wider for our

373
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,908
survival

374
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:21,850
that said the European Union is not just

375
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:24,309
another trade area but the single most

376
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,049
important project of peace and

377
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:28,000
prosperity in the history of our

378
00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:31,060
continent

379
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,760
NATO is not purposive firepower pool

380
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:38,620
that bunch of countries put together to

381
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:42,370
defend themselves surely we are the

382
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:48,189
Alliance of common interest but more

383
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:56,620
important we are the Alliance of common

384
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:59,800
values it is the core of what we are it

385
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:06,760
is unquestionable part of our security

386
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:11,530
our values are our strongest survival

387
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:15,010
weapon against any enemy that's why we

388
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:19,000
can act globally as the advocates of the

389
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:24,370
human rights and respect for dignity of

390
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,450
every single human being our values are

391
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,820
the unique reasons why we are the good

392
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:34,270
guys

393
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:40,270
whether it is freedom of speech freedom

394
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:45,160
of media respect for NGOs or fight for

395
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:50,080
good governance none of them can be

396
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:52,840
betrayed without the gene Ian will to

397
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,320
tender democratic principles in every

398
00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:02,290
single Member State our ability to act

399
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:04,720
together could be compromised now let me

400
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:08,680
explain that the second point what I

401
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:14,110
mean by talking about our enemies

402
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:18,130
getting into our heads especially holds

403
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:21,310
true here in Europe to put in simply we

404
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:23,830
should stop helping them to paint a

405
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:28,210
picture of gloom and doom of Western

406
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:31,240
civilization surely we have been facing

407
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:35,620
many challenges and security threats

408
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:40,420
recently maybe too many in a short

409
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,250
period of time we are all horrified by

410
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,890
terrorists our

411
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:48,270
getting our people in our peaceful way

412
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:50,850
of life they murdered 22 you know some

413
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:56,970
young man women and kids again in

414
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:59,459
Manchester this week also there are

415
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:03,330
challenges in the EU we have to solve

416
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,390
part of hard work is needed and there is

417
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:10,470
always plenty of ways how something can

418
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:13,370
go wrong so my intention is not to

419
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:17,640
downplay the difficulties of our

420
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:22,879
situation or to underestimate the tasks

421
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:27,270
we face individually and together but

422
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,400
let's stop playing the game of the

423
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,660
enemies of the peaceful and prosperous

424
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,000
West

425
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,250
let's stop creating the picture of

426
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,860
apocalypse just waiting to happen

427
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:41,640
let's stop supporting the narrative of

428
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:46,620
the EU and NATO being on the verge of

429
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:49,410
terrible irreparable breakdown let's

430
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:54,300
stop seeing the need for revolution and

431
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:58,860
radical solutions when in fact what we

432
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:02,990
need is old-fashioned politics and sober

433
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:07,500
policies because what I see in our

434
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:11,280
countries is still the best the most

435
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:16,170
prosperous the most secure and stable

436
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:22,470
place on earth for people to live in by

437
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:26,250
far and finally my third point which i

438
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:32,750
think is the unfortunate outcome of the

439
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:36,320
first two we all have been reminded by

440
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:40,020
recent election how fragile our

441
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,350
democratic societies could become once

442
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:46,410
they are under combined pressure of

443
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,899
dissatisfied voters targeted

444
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:53,750
anti-western propaganda and weakest

445
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,750
pawns from our political leaders

446
00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:03,120
I think I will speak on behalf of all of

447
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:06,250
us here when I say we have learned our

448
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,250
lesson we have witnessed too many

449
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,190
attempts to heck our democratic

450
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:15,490
societies recently there is no need to

451
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:19,690
play the Russian roulette about the end

452
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:22,690
of NATO the EU or the whole Western

453
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:26,770
civilization every time our people

454
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:33,250
exercise their freedom to vote we have

455
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:38,410
seen enough now our tasks as political

456
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:42,100
leaders is to make our election like

457
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:45,490
boring again seriously we should do our

458
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:47,949
best to count down election races to

459
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:51,820
battle of ideas stemming from our

460
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:55,000
democratic societies not battles for

461
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:58,360
survival of our democratic world the

462
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,720
elections in Netherlands in Austria and

463
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:04,659
most recently in France paved the way in

464
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,690
right direction they demonstrated that

465
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:10,770
we can rely on our public then we show

466
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:13,780
determination to find solutions and

467
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:19,629
political courage to defend our common

468
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:23,560
principles and values ladies and

469
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:26,410
gentlemen Georgian President Mark Ballas

470
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:31,210
really a good friend of mine officially

471
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:34,690
visit it Slovakia recently and you all

472
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:38,670
know how difficult times this country

473
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:43,270
and its people have had to go through I

474
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:47,500
asked him how they managed and he

475
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:51,160
answered although complicated the

476
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:54,880
current situation is not a problem the

477
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:59,320
problem will be if we give up on our

478
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:04,330
moral imperative and stop fighting for

479
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:08,270
what is right I agree if we build the

480
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,879
strength and resilience at home

481
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:14,570
we can be more confident when dealing

482
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,730
with international crisis grave breaches

483
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,490
of international law in Georgia and

484
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,550
Ukraine atrocities committed on

485
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:26,030
civilians in Aleppo and several other

486
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:30,320
cities in Syria in Iraq are important

487
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:37,280
reminders that our ability or inability

488
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:41,120
to act decisively is crucial we can't

489
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,520
ever forget what defines us although we

490
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,489
face many challenges and are busy with

491
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:53,690
various problems let our values and

492
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:57,970
principles guide us that is our single

493
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:03,470
most important security policy our

494
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:06,430
unique adaptation tocut thank you very

495
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,430
much for your attention

496
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,010
Thank You mr. president very much for

497
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,940
your candid words I like an ocean of

498
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,330
Russian roulette

499
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:27,180
if it's with one round that can be a fun

500
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,419
and thrill if it's with six that is a

501
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,830
suicide I hope we do not end up there

502
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:35,910
it's a special privilege and pleasure to

503
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:38,310

without any doubt growing systematically

569
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:02,070
it has been growing since we shook off

570
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:06,000
the bond of communism and since we

571
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:09,240
became again fully independent countries

572
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,780

collaboration on the development and

595
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:22,908
cohesion within the European Union which

596
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:25,440
is termed as the three C's initiative

597
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:29,340
now let me use this opportunity and

598
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,010
stress very strongly that Poland wants

599
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,960
to be a unifying power and an active

600
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:37,810
participant of both this format of

601
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,360
regional cooperation within two

602
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:42,190
fundamental organizations of the

603
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,100
euro-atlantic community within the

604
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:51,670
European Union and within the North

605
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:54,400
Atlantic Alliance Poland considers it as

606
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:56,740
a strategic task in international

607
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,520
politics but at the same time also as a

608
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:04,240
logical consequence of its membership in

609
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:08,110
the European Union and in NATO Poland

610
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,910
wants to Co shape the transatlantic

611
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:16,560
community through the regional community

612
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:20,020
it is precisely central Europe which is

613
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,870
that natural political environment for

614
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:26,680
Poland that is why we want and we are

615
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:31,330
striving for its security cohesiveness

616
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,890
and economic and dynamic from the

617
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:35,590
economic point of view at the same time

618
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:39,460
Poland is committed to making sure that

619
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:44,580
both NATO and therapy and Union remain a

620
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:47,710
unity yeah just like security is

621
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:52,540
indivisible within NATO in the same way

622
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:55,240
the development of Europe is reasonable

623
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:57,160
only if the European Union remains to be

624
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,379
a whole as I said during the security

625
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,420
conference in Munich if the West is

626
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,810
supposed to be strong it will be strong

627
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:09,760
only by its unity if it is supposed to

628
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:11,860
fall it will fall divided Poland also

629
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,260
wants to make sure that the Atlantic

630
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:18,130
community through the contribution of

631
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:23,050
our region also remains open to new

632
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:26,440
States this is crucially important task

633
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:28,720
of Central Europe to be an advocate of

634
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:33,040
the open-door policy both to the

635
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:36,250
European Union and NATO it is in the

636
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,120
interest of our part of Europe not to

637
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:44,320
become a permanent border region but to

638
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:46,400
expand your Atlantic bonds to the east

639
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,170
and to the south

640
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,810
therefore we are advocates of extending

641
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:56,690
stability and important staff on the

642
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:59,110
path to turn our objectives into reality

643
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:02,450
was last year's NATO summit in Warsaw

644
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:05,180
back then we took breakthrough decisions

645
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:07,819
they concern strengthening of the

646
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,339
defense potential of the entire North

647
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:13,550
Atlantic Alliance and of its further

648
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:18,020
adaptation to challenges of the 21st

649
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:22,100
century in our decisions we were led by

650
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:26,030
the principle of the so called 360

651
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:30,650
degrees which means that security is

652
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:33,800
indivisible in NATO States the guarantee

653
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:36,050
of that should be a priority of all

654
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,560
member states of NATO irrespective of

655
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,970
where they are situated geographically

656
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,500
Central European countries have

657
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:47,689
demonstrated that they have done their

658
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,610
homework as regards this very important

659
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:52,550
principle of building of the global

660
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,260
peace prior to NATO summit Poland

661
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,150
together with Romania Bulgaria the Czech

662
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:00,530
Republic Slovakia Hungary Lithuania

663
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:03,620
Latvia Estonia decided to tighten their

664
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:07,000
cooperation within the framework of the

665
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:09,560
already mentioned Bucharest 9 and

666
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,840
despite differences in individual

667
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,279
concepts of national security we reached

668
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,150
an agreement on a couple of fundamental

669
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,910
issues referring to defence policy among

670
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,800
them was our conviction of the

671
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:25,129
indispensable strengthening of the

672
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:29,140
eastern flank of NATO through deployment

673
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:32,210
of battle groups of NATO member states

674
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:34,509
in the Baltic Sea region as part of the

675
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:39,050
so-called enhanced forward presence and

676
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:41,840
on the other hand increasing the

677
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,960
presence of NATO forces in South Eastern

678
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,610
Europe and the Black Sea region as part

679
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:52,070
of the so-called tailored forward

680
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:54,350
presence as region we gave as a letter

681
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:58,340
based response to the question

682
00:38:54,350 --> 00:39:03,440
how to best guarantee harmony and order

683
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:05,870
in Europe however the aforementioned

684
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,790
solidarity would have not come about

685
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,400
without a feeling of responsibility on

686
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,930
part of countries of Central Europe as

687
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,210
reliable members of NATO and European

688
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:17,120
Union we take our share of

689
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:20,090
responsibility for the European and

690
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,460
global security we want to improve the

691
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,630
level of security through the expansion

692
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,930
of non-aggressive

693
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:31,490
deterrence and defense capabilities such

694
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:34,790
a posture is presented by us through

695
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,439
modernizing our own Armed Forces we are

696
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:39,380
decreasing our defense spending

697
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:42,260
we are modernizing the equipment of the

698
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:45,620
Armed Forces and we are developing our

699
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:47,720
territorial defence forces in such a way

700
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:52,370
Central Europe tries to maximize

701
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:54,379
security guarantees to optimize the

702
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:57,770
military potential of its own Armed

703
00:39:54,380 --> 00:40:02,090
Forces and which is obvious to minimize

704
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:04,400
threats an important aspect of the

705
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,100
message which is going out from Central

706
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:11,690
Europe is stressing the importance of

707
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:14,960
international law it's absolute respect

708
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:16,790
is treated by us as a lodestar which

709
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,130
leads us in all our international

710
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:21,740
activities therefore we have

711
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,130
consistently supported putting an end to

712
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:28,129
aggression and for peaceful resolution

713
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:31,130
of any conflicts we are absolutely

714
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:33,140
opposed to armed aggression we are

715
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:36,200
involved in the global anti-terror

716
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,839
collision and anti dodge collisions in

717
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,180
the most explosive regions of the world

718
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,140
we have been providing the indispensable

719
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:47,299
humanitarian and training assistance

720
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:50,180
Central Europe is therefore not only the

721
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,340
consumer but and I want to stress it

722
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:56,720
very strongly also the provider of

723
00:40:52,340 --> 00:41:00,620
security our region treats this in a

724
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,020
comprehensive way therefore we do not

725
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,210
only want to invest in developing land

726
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,230
forces and maritime forces and air

727
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,520
forces and

728
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,950
virtual countries of the region have

729
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,130
participated in developing anti-missile

730
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:16,220
defense systems we are developing also

731
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,859
the cybersecurity in our countries we

732
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:23,299
are countering hybrid threats including

733
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:25,069
des information this is our

734
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,410
comprehensive approach vis-a-vis

735
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,720
security and we have proved that in our

736
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:31,450
activities with taken within NATO in

737
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,450
Slovakia the Czech Republic Estonia

738
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:38,560
Lithuania Latvia Bulgaria Romania

739
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:41,720
Slovenia in Hungary and in Poland and

740
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,369
there are centers of excellence

741
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,890
established by NATO which are

742
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:48,380
functioning smoothly their basic task is

743
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:50,720
to better prepare the Alliance among

744
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:54,310
others in cooperation among special

745
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,890
services crisis management communication

746
00:41:54,310 --> 00:42:02,000
strategic communication or energy

747
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:05,720
security ladies and gentlemen

748
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,490
distinguished guests all of us are

749
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:12,680
perfectly aware of the fact that

750
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,569
security of our countries is strictly

751
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,419
intertwined with the economic

752
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:19,580
development of our estates peace cannot

753
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:23,420
be guaranteed without well-functioning

754
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:26,259
market on the other hand the economic

755
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:31,700
advancement will surely be stopped

756
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:33,590
should a real military threat appear the

757
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,080
speed of economic growth depends on many

758
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:38,650
circumstances one of the most important

759
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,420
factors is the adopted development model

760
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:44,690
over the last couple of years we were

761
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,940
able to see which markets turned out to

762
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,760
be most resilient visited crisis and

763
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:52,520
that slowdown in the global economy it

764
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,760
was the time of the global verification

765
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,910
of how rational the principles were on

766
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,270
which economy is based Central Europe

767
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:03,680
has passed that test the country

768
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,690
situated between the Adriatic Sea the

769
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,879
Baltic Sea and the Black Sea have

770
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:10,460
demonstrated their resilience they have

771
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:13,800
proved their stable and their economies

772
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,600
are robust our countries have a

773
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,260
efficiently limited their budget

774
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:21,960
deficits decreased public debt and cut

775
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:23,910
down the unemployment rate we have

776
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,320
remained to be a written attractive for

777
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:31,319
investments and here businesspeople from

778
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,970
Western Europe from Asia or from America

779
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,640
can come and conduct their businesses

780
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:37,529
with success recently next to the

781
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,960
dynamic increase in mutual trade

782
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:42,540
relations we have deepened economic ties

783
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,150
with the western part of the old

784
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:48,420
continent thanks to such instruments as

785
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:51,510
funds from the cohesion policy of the

786
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:54,540
European Union we have come closer to

787
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:57,410
the high living standards of the

788
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:00,660
societies in western and northern Europe

789
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,970
this impressive transformation would not

790
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:06,660
have been possible however without the

791
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:10,169
huge potential which is so typical for

792
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:12,690
Central Europe it makes us stand out we

793
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:15,270
can and I believe that we want to use a

794
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:17,640
number of assets in our region they

795
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,410
create a catalogue of competitive

796
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,910
advantages which are decisive about the

797
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:23,730
growing economic position of our

798
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:26,520
countries the place of Central Europe on

799
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:27,770
the economic map of the world results

800
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,030
from its characteristic features

801
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,890
geographical closeness and cultural

802
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:35,580
closeness of the countries of Central

803
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:38,400
Europe big discipline of public finances

804
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:40,560
and diligence as well as high

805
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,550
professional qualifications of our

806
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:50,779
society's modernization of our economic

807
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:53,550
systems is however still an open process

808
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:57,690
remembering among others those features

809
00:44:53,550 --> 00:45:01,200
I have decided to turn the three seas

810
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:04,800
initiative one of the priorities of my

811
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,470
presidency now let me use this

812
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,250
opportunity and stress very strongly not

813
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:14,520
so much the political as infrastructure

814
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:17,850
and economic character of this

815
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:21,600
initiative which right from the start I

816
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:23,460
have been conducting together with madam

817
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,560
president of Croatia Kalinda grabber

818
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,690
Qatar ovitch who is present in this room

819
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:32,380
with us today

820
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:35,350
ladies and gentlemen we have set up this

821
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,510
three seas initiative thinking about an

822
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:41,400
informal platform of cooperation between

823
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:44,410
Poland Croatia Lithuania Latvia Estonia

824
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:49,540
the Czech Republic Slovakia Slovenia

825
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:52,899
Hungary Romania Bulgaria Austria our

826
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:55,240
priority is to build infrastructure or

827
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,780
he sickness and economical his illness

828
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,700
along the north-south axis this will

829
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:04,390
multiply the positive effects of our

830
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:07,029
membership of the European Union by way

831
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:08,850
of complementing of the already advanced

832
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,730
relations between the East and the West

833
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:14,200
but doing so we want to be not only

834
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,660
beneficiaries but first and foremost we

835
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,450
want to be co-authors of the European

836
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:22,120
unity the unity which is expressed

837
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:24,819
through a dense network of roads rails

838
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:28,480
flight connections and energy

839
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:30,910
connections the success of the three

840
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,190
seas initiatives is a guarantee of

841
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:36,069
smooth functioning of the common

842
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,990
European market and increasing in the

843
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:40,000
credibility of a Ridge not only visit

844
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:42,970
the European partners but also

845
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,910
physically the global partners all these

846
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:49,540
issues will be discussed by us during

847
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:51,310
the upcoming second three seas summit

848
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:55,090
which will be organized in broad swath

849
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:57,040
in July this year we want the three seas

850
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:59,140
initiative to bring effects such as

851
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,900
increased innovation of our economies

852
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:05,350
and societies the implementation of

853
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,290
tasks which are so ambitious requires us

854
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:09,759
to continue our cooperation among the

855
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:14,020
three sea State this initiative is

856
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,830
addressed to a broad group of recipients

857
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:21,040
businesses experts local governments and

858
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:21,819
state-owned companies this openness for

859
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,650
different

860
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,570
melius for different groups and let me

861
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:29,250
stress this very strongly is the DNA

862
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,250
code of this initiative

863
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:36,559
distinguished guests ladies and

864
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:38,779
gentlemen I can see a certain important

865
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,029
similarity between our discussions today

866
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:43,369
concerning security here in Bratislava

867
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:47,869
and the discussions which will take

868
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:49,939
place in July in Poland during the

869
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:53,929
latter meeting we will discuss about

870
00:47:49,939 --> 00:47:57,769
economic development no matter which of

871
00:47:53,929 --> 00:48:00,199
these important regions who important

872
00:47:57,769 --> 00:48:01,848
topics will be discussed we are joined

873
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:03,499
in the conviction that is safe and

874
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:06,199
subjective Central Europe is an

875
00:48:03,499 --> 00:48:08,138
important element of stability and

876
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:11,719
development of the euro-atlantic world

877
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:14,389
therefore once again let me thank you

878
00:48:11,719 --> 00:48:16,099
for inviting me to Glock the conference

879
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:18,679
at the same time I would like to draw

880
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:21,349
your attention to that July 3 C's

881
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:23,059
initiative summit in Vlad suave there we

882
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:24,649
will be able to follow up on the

883
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:26,799
discussions which we started today on

884
00:48:24,649 --> 00:48:30,799
the dynamic community of Central Europe

885
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:32,419
which is the community of aspirations

886
00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:42,489
and ambitions alike

887
00:48:32,419 --> 00:48:46,239
thank you very much for attention ladies

888
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:48,829
I recommend our careful attention

889
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:52,159
because I think this will perfectly set

890
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:53,899
the stage in a very challenging way what

891
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:56,359
is going on in the world and will give

892
00:48:53,899 --> 00:49:01,009
you a very plastic and an interesting

893
00:48:56,359 --> 00:49:03,859
image so Nick please let me welcome your

894
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:07,189
panel and we will wait for a couple of

895
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:10,819
seconds until president leave the room

896
00:49:07,189 --> 00:49:11,828
but I think speakers can already take

897
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:14,299
their seats

898
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:16,880
there will be couple of free seats for

899
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:19,519
those who are your who stayed outside

900
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,829
and cannot get place as we got vacancies

901
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,049
in front please

902
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:29,689
refill the room there will be more free

903
00:49:24,049 --> 00:49:32,719
space here all right um very good to be

904
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:35,719
here again can I encourage we don't want

905
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,519
to speak to a third empty room so can I

906
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:40,549
encourage if you want to come forward

907
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:42,859
please because as some of you have seen

908
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:43,259
in recent years we've made this kind of

909
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:44,640
thing in

910
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:47,420
active and I want to start with you

911
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:50,549
right at the beginning in a moment so as

912
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:52,530
people come in from outside and please

913
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:55,770
take these seats at the front as well

914
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:58,440
I'm giving you one minute notice of a

915
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:00,690
brainstorming we have mics in the room I

916
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,030
want you to be thinking about the kind

917
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:06,030
of things that should be still on the

918
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:09,350
agenda here because we are talking about

919
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:12,690
global trends but I'd like to suggest

920
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:15,930
that in reality this is not just global

921
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:18,720
trends it's do we really get what is

922
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:21,569
happening what's the direction of travel

923
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:23,640
and what's the scale and it could just

924
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:25,920
be that even in this very extensive

925
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,170
agenda for the next two days there are

926
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:30,450
things missing and what I want to do is

927
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,610
encourage the panel to address some of

928
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,870
those issues as well so I'm giving you

929
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,880
that minute

930
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:38,100
really for you to think of the kind of

931
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,690
things which you are which others are

932
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,660
not thinking about remember where we

933
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:43,370
were this time last year brexit hadn't

934
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,839
happened

935
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:47,850
president Trump hadn't been nominated

936
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:50,010
let alone elected look at what's

937
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:52,110
happened in France look at so many

938
00:50:50,010 --> 00:50:54,480
things that have happened and look at

939
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:58,050
what wasn't on the agenda not even

940
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,640
mentioned here I'd like to quote and

941
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:02,160
remind you what the president said a

942
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:05,279
moment ago we have learned our lesson

943
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:08,190
weak response of political leaders he

944
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,080
said um he also added we need

945
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:12,390
old-fashioned politics but the foreign

946
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:15,600
minister added something equally

947
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:18,660
important leadership and vision should

948
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:21,150
not be constantly reacting hasty and

949
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,399
instinctive reactions are not good

950
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:25,830
enough that means for those of you in

951
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,020
companies those of you in governments

952
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:30,660
those of you in public service that's

953
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:32,550
your job to come up with the left field

954
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:35,160
right field idea of what's coming down

955
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:36,930
the track however unpopular it might be

956
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,810
to your political leaders who are

957
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:42,509
thinking in a more conformist way so

958
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:43,980
you've had 50 seconds so far I want to

959
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:45,690
get the microphones moving around for

960
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,430
ten minutes before I invite the panel up

961
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,200
they're going to stimulate you as well

962
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:51,240
we're going to run for the next hour and

963
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,700
20 minutes so who'd like to come in with

964
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,790
ideas of what is yet not yet on the

965
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,790
agenda

966
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:04,799
Jonathan aisle from rusi please let's

967
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,349
make it quick quick otherwise I'll

968
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:09,390
simply say you've got no ideas and we'll

969
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:12,480
move on to the panel I would like to

970
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:15,420
take the the the sort of the position or

971
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:19,549
the idea put by our Slovak colleagues on

972
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:23,519
the subject of these Russian roulette of

973
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:25,980
elections in Europe the very narrow

974
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,598
escape that we seem to register every

975
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:31,289
time we have an election in Europe

976
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:34,049
without actually killing of the Hydra of

977
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:36,900
the fundamental problem backlash against

978
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:38,849
globalization fear of a younger

979
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,829
population about the future employment

980
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:42,869
opportunities a feeling that our

981
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:46,410
institutions are not working

982
00:52:42,869 --> 00:52:49,109
so we have not dealt with a populist

983
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:50,700
problem when we continually engage in

984
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:52,499
the Russian rule that's a very big

985
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,509
challenge and they're already issues

986
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:56,730
here Jonathan thank you very much

987
00:52:54,509 --> 00:52:58,109
pericana who's technically still a

988
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,519
millennial you'll be talking as a

989
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:02,910
millennial in a moment anyone else

990
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,140
please yes over there and put your hands

991
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:07,170

992
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:10,319
you please John Robert with me things we

993
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:13,710
have a problem of identities you've got

994
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:18,029
in Britain large numbers people who do

995
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:23,269
not know necessarily what identity they

996
00:53:18,029 --> 00:53:27,210
are accepted as having take for example

997
00:53:23,269 --> 00:53:29,160
many not all but many Muslims in Britain

998
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:32,220
they're perfectly happy to describe

999
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:36,359
themselves a British but they're not

1000
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:37,529
English even if they live in England all

1001
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:40,348
right John what identity

1002
00:53:37,529 --> 00:53:42,539
what happens if Britain breaks up right

1003
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:44,849
I didn't that's a different one identity

1004
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:45,299
right okay could it be the dis United

1005
00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:49,079
Kingdom

1006
00:53:45,299 --> 00:53:51,630
please who would like to come in okay

1007
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:54,180
all of you have please over here yes hi

1008
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:58,440
hi I'm Elena crystal universe Ted Kenda

1009
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:00,569
um global security strategy 2016 and put

1010
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:02,640
at the center of the strategy the

1011
00:54:00,569 --> 00:54:04,200
concept of resilience I would like the

1012
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,390
panelists if possible actually to

1013
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,819
comment whatever put whatever there is a

1014
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:09,420
moment on resilience because the concept

1015
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:11,970
actually

1016
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,980
is quite complex so that is how can we

1017
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:15,959
enable resilience especially in the

1018
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:20,430
neighborhood but also within Europe

1019
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,770
itself on prescription does it work how

1020
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,720
can we build resilience and

1021
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:27,599
self-governance of those states lovely

1022
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,790
thank you anyone else please anyone else

1023
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,790
you're afraid to the back anyone else

1024
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:37,259
over here yes hello naturally new grid

1025
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:39,240
from The Guardian I I I'm struck that as

1026
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,180
we contemplate all these events that

1027
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:45,540
you've mentioned Nick we we're still

1028
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:48,359
missing a picture a wider global picture

1029
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:51,900
that includes that includes the mention

1030
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:56,910
of China China is building the one belt

1031
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:58,559
one road project we we tend not to look

1032
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,420
at it when we have these discussions

1033
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,220
about European security architecture and

1034
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,200
values but I think we need to think

1035
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,459
about this because it's also going to be

1036
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,230
a big part of this particular after the

1037
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:08,670
big meeting last week but Parag is going

1038
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:10,170
to talk exactly about that

1039
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:14,250
so you've preempted him anyone else

1040
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:16,559
please please yes we got five more

1041
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:20,369
minutes no more my name is Karl kovanda

1042
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:22,710
from Brussels and Prague and I was

1043
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:24,299
intrigued by president Duda observation

1044
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:26,819
that he doesn't want Poland to be a

1045
00:55:24,299 --> 00:55:29,040
border country number one and number two

1046
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:31,410
that he's standing for further

1047
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:35,579
enlargement of NATO and the European

1048
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:38,098
Union Ukraine is the obvious question

1049
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:42,480
that comes to mind and Ukraine is a

1050
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:44,190
country with tremendous tremendous

1051
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,690
weight in Europe and I don't know that

1052
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,160
we're giving it another tension thank

1053
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:49,020
you all right let me encourage you down

1054
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,270
the issue of resilience about identity

1055
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:53,849
what Jonathan I'll mentioned about the

1056
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:55,829
very serious issues of automation of AI

1057
00:55:53,849 --> 00:55:57,450
and all this other stuff coming down the

1058
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:59,220
track very quickly which politicians

1059
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:04,558
have to handle the overarching themes

1060
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:05,819
here anyone else please you're all

1061
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,040
comfortable with the way the world is

1062
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:09,720
going that's great okay fine so you

1063
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,390
don't need to be here for two days right

1064
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:14,308
anyone else please you've got four

1065
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,509
minutes now and then Yakka will be

1066
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:17,640
speaking okay thank you

1067
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:19,170
I'm the Australian ambassador in Vienna

1068
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,640
so I come from a very different part of

1069
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:22,430
the world I've just come from Sydney

1070
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,288
yesterday today

1071
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:26,029
well you'll understand that there's a

1072
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:28,849
massive security dynamic going on in

1073
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:30,289
Asia and the indo-pacific as well I want

1074
00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:31,760
to reinforce the point made earlier

1075
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:35,079
about the importance of China that is a

1076
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:37,700
bigger longer-term game than Russia and

1077
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:39,410
attention needs to be paid to that there

1078
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:41,720
are massive proliferation problems in

1079
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:44,118
with North Korea but the key point I

1080
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:46,160
want to make is as a huge Liberal

1081
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:48,859
Democratic resource out there beyond

1082
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,779
Europe that needs to be harnessed for

1083
00:56:48,859 --> 00:56:52,520
global purposes and I'd point

1084
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:54,619
particularly to the countries of the

1085
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:57,079
Western Hemisphere other than the United

1086
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:59,000
States particularly the emerging Latin

1087
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:01,819
American countries there are tremendous

1088
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,319
force for democratic values thank you

1089
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:04,849
and I think it's interesting having been

1090
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:07,339
to the Australian leadership retreat in

1091
00:57:04,849 --> 00:57:09,170
Gold Coast last week the way that

1092
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:11,779
there's already disaffection now growing

1093
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:13,789
significantly in Australian parties as

1094
00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:16,400
well political parties to anyone else

1095
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:18,410
please so it's not unique to Europe and

1096
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,390
where everyone else comes from here and

1097
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,490
in Latin America and what else right

1098
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:25,520
I'll close the tab then right let me in

1099
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:27,319
that case invite Jakob to to join us on

1100
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,089
the platform what I'm going to do is

1101
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:31,308
invite the other panelists up in a

1102
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:33,049
moment but Jakob who is the echo breach

1103
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:35,599
Nevsky was the vice president of globe

1104
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:38,390
sec and the director of the Policy

1105
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,890
Institute here in Bratislava until last

1106
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:43,190
year was the Polish Ambassador to the

1107
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:45,589
OECD give us your three critical points

1108
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:47,359
Jakob which really need to stimulate

1109
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:48,500
even further debate and what I'd like

1110
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:50,900
you to feel is that this is a

1111
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,559
conversation not just a panel talking to

1112
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:57,260
you thank you very much Nick it's

1113
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:01,279
sunshine outside but this room is just

1114
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:03,500
gonna be about more darker and and I

1115
00:58:01,279 --> 00:58:07,700
want to talk about free witches

1116
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:10,279
sorry for this demonology they keep the

1117
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:14,029
globe SEC Policy Institute staff awake

1118
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:17,000
at night our research revolves around

1119
00:58:14,029 --> 00:58:20,029
three big topics and that these are just

1120
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,670
like the free witches from from

1121
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:25,430
Shakespeare's Macbeth by prophecies

1122
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:29,599
about the future that will happen if we

1123
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:32,848
ignore the warning signs first the world

1124
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:35,249
of rules is tottering

1125
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:38,579
paradoxically a few decades ago it were

1126
00:58:35,249 --> 00:58:42,410
liberal intellectuals who advocated for

1127
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:43,650
deconstruction of common narratives

1128
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:47,129
post-structuralism

1129
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:50,309
was in fashion this exercise became a

1130
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:54,420
copy of average on and even all over the

1131
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:57,180
world we learned to deconstruct do we

1132
00:58:54,420 --> 00:59:00,869
know how to reconstruct something new

1133
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:04,259
and workable the unipolar moment of the

1134
00:59:00,869 --> 00:59:07,769
us-led world development is definitely

1135
00:59:04,259 --> 00:59:11,460
over the EU is being laughed at in many

1136
00:59:07,769 --> 00:59:14,488
corners of Europe and the world while we

1137
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:17,970
are waiting to create new meanings to

1138
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:20,069
fill the void others step up illiberal

1139
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:22,979
democracy is on the rise

1140
00:59:20,069 --> 00:59:26,069
some countries stand by the rules only

1141
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:29,089
when it suits them let us not get

1142
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:31,589
depressed though there is always hope

1143
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:35,849
technology makes us more prosperous

1144
00:59:31,589 --> 00:59:39,210
better informed safer industrial

1145
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:42,719
automation promises new heights of

1146
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:45,900
manufacturing productivity also loss of

1147
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,029
jobs big data helps us to enable

1148
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:51,210
government and businesses to better

1149
00:59:48,029 --> 00:59:55,200
serve citizens it also creates

1150
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:57,509
temptation for abuse think of the impact

1151
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,808
of technological change on the

1152
00:59:57,509 --> 01:00:04,319
International Relations once upon a time

1153
01:00:00,809 --> 01:00:10,910
the UN loftily debated human rights

1154
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:13,999
issues in New York City bubbles and

1155
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:18,029
suffering people had no effective voice

1156
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:20,819
now those victims have mobile phones we

1157
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:23,940
also pictures of Syrians after lethal

1158
01:00:20,819 --> 01:00:26,819
gas attack citizens around the world

1159
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:29,910
have new ways to keep an eye on what

1160
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:33,440
their leaders are doing these changes

1161
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:36,479
create a new sense of shared global

1162
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,900
responsibility if you walk down the road

1163
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:42,118
and see a man

1164
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:45,089
flogging brutally his wife or his child

1165
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,589
or his dog in the garden you probably

1166
01:00:45,089 --> 01:00:48,900
think it right to inter

1167
01:00:46,589 --> 01:00:51,058
Dean what at least to call the police

1168
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,549
why should it be different at the

1169
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:56,910
international level can national

1170
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:58,739
sovereignty be a shield protecting

1171
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,950
tyrants who are persecuting their own

1172
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:04,650
citizens their own people

1173
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:07,618
not really but as Iraq and Afghanistan

1174
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:10,259
and Syria clear clearly show it is one

1175
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:13,079
thing to identify a moral cause for

1176
01:01:10,259 --> 01:01:16,710
intervention it is quite another to work

1177
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:18,950
out what exactly to do citizens now use

1178
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:22,019
technology to follow their leaders

1179
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:24,749
government use technology to follow over

1180
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:28,288
citizens this is why we need the world

1181
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:30,569
of rules more than ever and here comes

1182
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:34,229
the second which the open model of

1183
01:01:30,569 --> 01:01:37,140
society which is vulnerable the empires

1184
01:01:34,229 --> 01:01:39,239
of the future are the empires of a mind

1185
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:42,359
I'm quoting Winston Churchill here in

1186
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:45,329
the world with our children inherit what

1187
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:47,219
defines a superpower will not be weapons

1188
01:01:45,329 --> 01:01:50,549
of mass destruction that can never be

1189
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:54,269
used it will be ability to combine and

1190
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:57,779
to build the power of mass innovation

1191
01:01:54,269 --> 01:02:01,288
and the and must teamwork this is why

1192
01:01:57,779 --> 01:02:03,660
our mindsets are so important are you

1193
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:05,969
someone who feels that Muslims Roma

1194
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:09,049
people asylum seekers Brussels

1195
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:11,279
bureaucrat just wait to do your harm or

1196
01:02:09,049 --> 01:02:14,609
do you think it's a big beautiful I

1197
01:02:11,279 --> 01:02:18,299
would wear a big beautiful world out

1198
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:19,890
there full of opportunities well the

1199
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:23,190
choice for openness does not come

1200
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:26,219
naturally globalization has made some

1201
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:29,279
people really confused people want to

1202
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:31,529
take back control over borders of their

1203
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:35,880
professional lives of institutions that

1204
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:38,130
they are governed by them they are angry

1205
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,249
at the elites it does not help that

1206
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:44,729
wages are not growing fast enough

1207
01:02:40,249 --> 01:02:48,328
societies are aging and the people

1208
01:02:44,729 --> 01:02:50,399
become risk-averse these are these are

1209
01:02:48,329 --> 01:02:52,890
there are countries who are grave eight

1210
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,729
the problem they won't ask the West to

1211
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:58,730
fail and very preach of a night is Right

1212
01:02:56,729 --> 01:03:02,180
principle

1213
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:04,700
is asymmetric war of ideas they practice

1214
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:08,330
propaganda and propaganda is like

1215
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:11,930
cooking a frog the water is heating up

1216
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:14,350
slowly until the frog is cooked can we

1217
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:17,480
wake up and jump out of the water before

1218
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:18,310
before it is too late yes I believe we

1219
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,619
can

1220
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:24,890
third and last trend is that we are

1221
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:27,950
living in post truth society politicians

1222
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:32,390
have always flirted with untruths to put

1223
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:35,480
it mildly now lies however have become

1224
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:38,650
systemic subjective perceptions are

1225
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:42,560
increasingly more important than facts

1226
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:45,080
lies spread like fire the media in

1227
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:48,680
crisis journalism is no longer neutral

1228
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:53,049
we eliminated the gatekeepers who

1229
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,049
verified whether a given story is true

1230
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:58,250
dissemination of fake news is so easy

1231
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:01,780
anybody can be a journalist with a smart

1232
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:05,359
phone or a useful idiot spreading lies

1233
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:09,170
so social media have become information

1234
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:10,640
war weapons fact-checking is needed we

1235
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:13,160
should empower people to think

1236
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:15,200
critically it is in the interest of

1237
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:17,960
social media to help the public

1238
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:20,359
authorities to find solutions Media

1239
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:24,140
literacy could be the curriculum of

1240
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:27,290
pupils at school we in the West have our

1241
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:30,589
stories to tell about the world of rules

1242
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:33,170
about the benefits of open society we

1243
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:36,940
just forgot how to tell them we have our

1244
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:39,710
own appealing emotional narratives

1245
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:42,890
ladies and gentlemen before I finish it

1246
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:45,980
would be the tragedy of all of us if the

1247
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:48,770
West became mismanaged divided in word

1248
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:51,680
looking there are things we all can do

1249
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:54,950
we as glob SEC staff you as glob sac

1250
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:57,109
honorable guests you will find some

1251
01:04:54,950 --> 01:05:00,799
policy prescriptions of my Institute in

1252
01:04:57,109 --> 01:05:03,799
our publications outside this room defy

1253
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:07,130
the negative trends we are not bound by

1254
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:10,640
fate to fail in our efforts like poor

1255
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:12,050
wretched Macbeth if only we pay

1256
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,330
attention

1257
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:23,120
beware of the three witches thank you

1258
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:24,770
very much thank you Jakob right global

1259
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,870
trends anyone want to add anything to

1260
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:29,270
the mix from earlier having heard Yakko

1261
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:31,970
but let me invite the three panelists on

1262
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:34,520
stage professor Steve Walt from Harvard

1263
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:37,399
University Stephane Dion who is

1264
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:39,530
currently about to be the ambassador for

1265
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:41,480
Canada in Germany next week it'll be

1266
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:43,760
formalized he's designate technically

1267
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,980
but also a new post for the Canadian

1268
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,590
government in Europe as special envoy

1269
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:51,200
and finally pericana who's a senior

1270
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:53,570
research fellow at Singapore University

1271
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:56,089
in the Lee Kuan Yew school but

1272
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:57,830
particularly here because he does

1273
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:59,900
represent the next generation the

1274
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:01,790
Millennials were not largely in this

1275
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:03,680
room at the moment and because of the

1276
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:05,720
work he's been doing on connect ography

1277
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:07,190
which is going to address some of the

1278
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,410
things you've already raised let me put

1279
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:11,480
to you that global trends and I was

1280
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:14,080
asked to chair a session about a vision

1281
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:17,050
of the world in 20 or more years

1282
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:20,450
addressed from various perspectives I

1283
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:24,280
said 20 years you'll be lucky if it's 20

1284
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:28,160
months maybe 20 weeks maybe 20 days

1285
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:29,780
maybe just 20 minutes after all it's

1286
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:33,379
easier in a session like this to say the

1287
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:35,510
world in 2020 or 2030 five I should tell

1288
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:36,830
you that's only seven hours away if you

1289
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:38,800
look at your watch I'm not being

1290
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:42,319
facetious here this world is moving

1291
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:43,880
incredibly quickly so um Stephen is

1292
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:46,370
going to talk about geopolitics in a

1293
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,290
moment particularly because of what he

1294
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:50,240
says is that there are many certainties

1295
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:52,370
in the world Stephan is going to put the

1296
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,720
geopolitical context on it as well and

1297
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:55,940
first of all though I'd like to ask

1298
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:59,480
Parekh who picking up on what Natalie

1299
01:06:55,940 --> 01:07:03,260
said you heard if Eric you've come here

1300
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:06,080
from Singapore via Bangkok to talk about

1301
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:08,900
exactly that about the impact of this on

1302
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:10,430
our assumptions of global trends so the

1303
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,140
deal is that parrot is going to give

1304
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,250
have a few minutes for remarks

1305
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,569
everyone's going to have a few minutes

1306
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:17,270
for remarks but I'd like you to come

1307
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:19,100
back very quickly after each person has

1308
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:22,940
spoken in case you want to clarify add

1309
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:24,910
or move the move the discussion in a

1310
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:27,730
slightly different direction

1311
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:29,859
should also say Facebook live we welcome

1312
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:32,500
you you're watching us and we feeding

1313
01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:34,630
into you so this discussion is not just

1314
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:36,460
about here in this room it's about vast

1315
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:38,830
numbers out there not just those

1316
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:40,270
watching having coffee next door Pike

1317
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:41,560
the floor is yours Thank You Nick you

1318
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:43,900
should have told me about the Facebook

1319
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:47,110
live earlier I would have had my phone

1320
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:49,240
out but anyway I'm delighted to be here

1321
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:50,980
Thank You Nick and thank you for for

1322
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:53,560
starting us off in a very from a global

1323
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:56,020
perspective and identifying this time

1324
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:57,820
horizon perhaps just the next few years

1325
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:59,790
because I think in the spirit of what

1326
01:07:57,820 --> 01:08:02,200
Steve also said earlier there are

1327
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:05,860
uncertainties that we should be taking

1328
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:07,330
or having taking into account for the

1329
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,770
rest of the conversations if we can

1330
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,060
start I have a couple of images that I

1331
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:11,860
want to share just to kick off the

1332
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,570
conversation that aren't going to go

1333
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:16,660
into some of the issues that you raised

1334
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:18,040
yet around populism and uncertainty but

1335
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:20,529
I think again should inform the

1336
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:23,170
conversation so the first image if we

1337
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:26,920
can get the first slide up here this

1338
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:29,200
shows you today today already China

1339
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,270
hat is the number one trade partner of

1340
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,130
more than twice as many countries in the

1341
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:36,250
world as the United States is that's

1342
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:38,560
today and so when you ask yourself when

1343
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:40,930
you look at how much time our media has

1344
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,520
spent focused on the transatlantic trade

1345
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:45,160
and investment partnership the TPP

1346
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:47,670
agreement neither of which unfortunately

1347
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:49,750
is moving forward thanks both to

1348
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:52,540
European leaders and the US and the

1349
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:54,640
former case and certainly the the Trump

1350
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:57,189
administration in the latter case though

1351
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,920
of course Barack Obama himself had had

1352
01:08:57,189 --> 01:09:02,529
sort of been forced to diminish his

1353
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,540
support for the TPP you should not be

1354
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:05,920
surprised to know that this is not only

1355
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,840
an image for today but it's probably

1356
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,140
only going to deepen and expand in terms

1357
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:13,090
of the number of red lines on the map

1358
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:15,130
in the years ahead because Western

1359
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:17,740
countries are not as aggressively

1360
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:19,270
pushing for free trade agreements or

1361
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:22,149
trade liberalisation the way Asian

1362
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:24,340
countries are and in the absence of TPP

1363
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:26,109
what you'll see is that on the right

1364
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:28,900
side of the screen if you will some of

1365
01:09:26,109 --> 01:09:31,839
the even more Asian countries are going

1366
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:35,620
to be even more wedded closely towards

1367
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:37,889
China now that's not just a map of trade

1368
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:41,189
in a way because historically in a store

1369
01:09:37,889 --> 01:09:42,719
patterns of of geopolitical change trade

1370
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:44,519
relationships become investment

1371
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:46,920
relationships investment relationships

1372
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,210
become strategic relationships so again

1373
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,880
looking at this why should it surprise

1374
01:09:48,210 --> 01:09:53,130
anyone to know how much more active

1375
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,050
China's NAIT China's Navy wants to be

1376
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:58,110
for example in the Indian Ocean or the

1377
01:09:55,050 --> 01:10:00,780
fact that it's opened up a base of some

1378
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:03,420
kind in in countries like Djibouti that

1379
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:05,909
will only continue to expand as those

1380
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:08,909
red lines become more fixed and a China

1381
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:10,320
slowdown and ever-so-slight or even a

1382
01:10:08,909 --> 01:10:13,049
significant slowdown in the Chinese

1383
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,969
economy doesn't change the fact that it

1384
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:17,310
is really the largest trade partner for

1385
01:10:14,969 --> 01:10:18,719
now two-thirds of all the countries in

1386
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:21,449
the world if we can quickly look at the

1387
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:24,480
second slide as well and that will help

1388
01:10:21,449 --> 01:10:26,969
us to isolate the geography of the

1389
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:29,580
eastern two-thirds of your of Eurasia

1390
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:31,380
why is this map interesting well what

1391
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:34,730
you don't see on it is a very important

1392
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:37,800
statistic most of the world's population

1393
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:39,150
more than more like sixty percent of the

1394
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,310
world's population lives on this

1395
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:43,739
two-dimensional image right and I've

1396
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:45,900
almost purposely crafted it to cut off

1397
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:47,549
at the Black Sea so we're not where we

1398
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,080
are sitting or is not yet on this map

1399
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:52,619
but two-thirds of the world's population

1400
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:54,239
almost lies just east of us here

1401
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:54,719
stretching all the way to the Pacific

1402
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:57,150
Ocean

1403
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,590
now Nick referenced earlier the the belt

1404
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:00,869
and road initiative the one belt one

1405
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:03,239
road summit that that that took place

1406
01:11:00,869 --> 01:11:07,139
last week in Beijing and this is a map

1407
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:11,879
that shows you what major high-speed

1408
01:11:07,139 --> 01:11:14,190
railways ultra high voltage electricity

1409
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,860
cables

1410
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:18,780
let's see oil and gas pipelines and so

1411
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:20,549
forth are going to be developed and you

1412
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:22,949
all saw this in the news I hope the

1413
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:24,630
incredible enthusiasm with which dozens

1414
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:27,509
and dozens of countries turned up and

1415
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:29,130
this is actually a story that began 25

1416
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:31,830
years ago with the collapse of the

1417
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:33,750
Soviet Union when China began to lay

1418
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:37,860
these foundations of infrastructural

1419
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:39,719
connectivity reaching from from east to

1420
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,280
west in this direction and I think to

1421
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:44,550
Europe's credit Europe has been very

1422
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,590
positive and in a way of breaking if you

1423
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,719
will from US pressure not to participate

1424
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:50,730
in the Asian infrastructure investment

1425
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:53,310
bank the one belt Run Road and in

1426
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:54,719
said turning up there to participate in

1427
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:56,370
what is and I think that is a map of

1428
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,020
certainty that is not just a map

1429
01:11:56,370 --> 01:12:00,660
actually to 20/20 Nick I would put that

1430
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:02,490
as the map of 2040 and I can say with

1431
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:05,010
some certainty having traveled those

1432
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:06,420
silk roads for the last 20 years that a

1433
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:08,250
lot have already been built in the next

1434
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:11,010
20 I expect all the RET all of the rest

1435
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:13,770
to be built and I expect Europe and Asia

1436
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:15,960
to really come together into into this

1437
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:17,940
mega continent and many of you may not

1438
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:21,360
know as you follow trade and economic

1439
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:23,429
dynamics we tend to think of the us-eu

1440
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:25,009
trade relationship as the single largest

1441
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:26,850
in term intra-regional trade

1442
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:28,830
relationship in the world more than one

1443
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:32,130
trillion dollars a year of goods and

1444
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:35,700
services but the --use trade with China

1445
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:38,790
plus its trade with India ASEAN Japan

1446
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:41,250
Korea and Australia so Asian countries

1447
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:42,780
is already far larger than its trade

1448
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:44,310
with the United States so for those of

1449
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,679
you here in this room want to adapt to

1450
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:48,960
the future I think you could be very

1451
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:51,240
well served by looking and mapping out

1452
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,130
the infrastructure linkages and the

1453
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,960
trade relationships that that you

1454
01:12:53,130 --> 01:12:57,030
collectively have with Asia because they

1455
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,890
are already larger than your

1456
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:01,139
relationships with the United States and

1457
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:03,600
that's before you have any meaningful

1458
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:05,820
trade agreements whatsoever with Asian

1459
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,680
countries and it's before many of these

1460
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:09,599
Silk Road corridors are even built so it

1461
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:12,690
brings me to the third and final map

1462
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,550
just to stop and this is a map of

1463
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:16,530
Europe's energy grid this is

1464
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:18,810
particularly just oil and gas pipelines

1465
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:20,639
it serves several purposes first of all

1466
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:23,280
it's a reminder of just how integrated

1467
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:25,350
Europe already is it's fine and well to

1468
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,389
focus just on brexit and to see the

1469
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:29,520
glass as half empty but this is a

1470
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:31,770
reminder that Europe is also in many

1471
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:35,130
ways an egg that cannot be unscrambled

1472
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:37,440
and the the energy sharing across the

1473
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:39,600
region is one very good example of that

1474
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,339
so this is a existing oil and gas

1475
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,110
pipelines and the dotted lines are some

1476
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,570
of the proposed ones what I think is

1477
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:47,490
very interesting here is that the

1478
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:50,219
eastward connections that are that are

1479
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:52,679
being built so additional North stream

1480
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:54,510
routes potentially South Stream and so

1481
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:57,210
forth the point is really that there is

1482
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:59,160
a growing energy diversification that is

1483
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:02,280
helping Europe build energy resilience

1484
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:04,320
it's no longer the case that that Russia

1485
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:04,650
you know singularly dictates Europe

1486
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,750
center

1487
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:08,489
she flows we should look at North Africa

1488
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:10,100
we should look at the Arctic and we

1489
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:13,949
should look when we look east at Russia

1490
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:16,020
across Turkey and of course to Iran and

1491
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:17,730
this is another case where I think the

1492
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:19,710
eastern side of this map helps you

1493
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:21,629
understand the extent to which in the

1494
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:23,489
coming years one very significant issue

1495
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:25,140
and I was very glad to hear the word

1496
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:27,599
earlier this morning self-confidence

1497
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:30,270
right European self-confidence is going

1498
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,489
to be pivotal in deciding how Europe has

1499
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:34,650
a region Europe as a collective deals

1500
01:14:32,489 --> 01:14:36,360
with Russia Turkey and Iran three

1501
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:38,790
countries that are getting obviously

1502
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:41,009
very negative headlines in some cases in

1503
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:42,929
some instances deservedly so but are

1504
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,940
crucial to your energy future to your

1505
01:14:42,929 --> 01:14:46,980
economic future to your future export

1506
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,620
markets Europe already is the leading

1507
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:51,718
investor in these three countries and is

1508
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:53,969
the leading market for exports for these

1509
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:55,949
countries and therefore it's very very

1510
01:14:53,969 --> 01:14:59,730
pivotal that Europe come to a coherent

1511
01:14:55,949 --> 01:15:01,019
cohesive and and comprehensive strategy

1512
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:04,349
towards these countries in the years

1513
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:06,480
ahead and I hope that we can map more

1514
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:08,429
connectivity to these regions and use

1515
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,830
that connectivity as an agent of

1516
01:15:08,429 --> 01:15:12,780
stability in the coming years thank you

1517
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:14,730
quick question then European

1518
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:16,620
self-confidence you had you say Europe

1519
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:18,629
has to have self-confidence do you

1520
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:21,330
believe it does at the moment I think

1521
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:23,310
that there is an opportunity to return

1522
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:26,610
to the period in time when there was

1523
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:28,170
less existential angst about the future

1524
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:30,420
of the eurozone and I hope that with the

1525
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:31,890
French election and the perhaps

1526
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:33,870
predictable outcome in the German

1527
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:37,040
election that they will once again have

1528
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:40,980
a strong franco-german axis that's Pro

1529
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:42,480
solidarity and that's Pro sort of unity

1530
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:43,980
in European foreign policy and those

1531
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:45,959
would be two very important elements

1532
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:47,699
Stephan and Steve can I just ask you to

1533
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,890
pick up on those points that Parekh's be

1534
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:51,599
making about about this how much is this

1535
01:15:49,890 --> 01:15:53,730
understood in Ottawa I mean I can

1536
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,650
imagine that if if that first map about

1537
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:57,959
China was on president Trump's

1538
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:59,639
screensaver he might sort of froth at

1539
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,520
the mouth before he's even opened I

1540
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:04,409
opened up his his Twitter feed in the

1541
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,940
morning Steve what what do you what what

1542
01:16:04,409 --> 01:16:07,379
is your reaction do you think this is

1543
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:09,178
understood in that way the Parekh has

1544
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,860
put it I don't think it's understood in

1545
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:12,690
the way he's put it I think that there

1546
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:14,250
are many Americans including President

1547
01:16:12,690 --> 01:16:16,469
Trump who are obviously concerned about

1548
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,650
China's rising what it means certainly

1549
01:16:16,469 --> 01:16:19,360
what it means for the

1550
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:22,179
and commitments in Asia and elsewhere

1551
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:23,559
the real debate in the United States and

1552
01:16:22,180 --> 01:16:25,630
it's going to be the issue we really

1553
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:28,090
wrestle with going forward is whether or

1554
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:30,700
not China's spectacular rise of the last

1555
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:32,890
30 or 40 years will continue or whether

1556
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:35,110
the accumulated liabilities China is

1557
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:37,120
facing and in particular its demographic

1558
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:39,460
challenges are going to be overcome in

1559
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:41,260
the next 10 or 20 years I'm actually

1560
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:43,000
much more optimistic about where the

1561
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:44,410
United States is going to be visa vie

1562
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,020
China but I think there's no question

1563
01:16:44,410 --> 01:16:49,599
that the sino-american relationship and

1564
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:52,450
how that plays itself out over the next

1565
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,130
10 20 30 40 years is going to cast an

1566
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:55,929
enormous shadow over the rest of world

1567
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:57,430
politics Stephane you are foreign

1568
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:59,500
minister until very recently how much

1569
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:01,570
does Ottawa get the scale of the

1570
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:04,840
challenge from China whether it be one

1571
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:06,730
belt one road or more broadly it's a

1572
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:10,270
challenge but it is an opportunity as

1573
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:12,639
well is it seen that way by some and by

1574
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:15,610
the government that I represents we have

1575
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:18,100
a debate in Canada about can we open

1576
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:21,099
talks and negotiations with China on

1577
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:24,070
free trade and some are opposed to that

1578
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:27,640
saying China is not a democracy their

1579
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:29,170
human rights record is appalling and the

1580
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:31,660
reaction of the govern that I

1581
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:34,030
represented Justin Trudeau's government

1582
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:37,389
is to say the world is not what we would

1583
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:41,349
like to but then engage the world and if

1584
01:17:37,390 --> 01:17:44,710
Canada is open to trade with China it

1585
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:46,780
may be beneficial for the human rights

1586
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:49,270
record of China but if we isolate

1587
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:51,840
yourself and we come with the megaphone

1588
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:55,060
politics by the sidelines and and

1589
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,400
criticize the world and pull out what

1590
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:59,410
will be the relevancy of Canada it will

1591
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:02,830
not be good for our economy but even for

1592
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:03,820
our ability to influence the world it

1593
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:06,250
would be negative

1594
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:08,170
Jakub do you think China and I'm being

1595
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:10,480
provocative here it could be classed as

1596
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:12,850
a fourth which judging by what you said

1597
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:14,919
earlier no no I would not treat it like

1598
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:16,870
that I think it's a opportunity for the

1599
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:19,060
world we are all richer because of china

1600
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:20,800
because chinese input to the world the

1601
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:22,960
problem is that the international

1602
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:26,140
institutions after the second world war

1603
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:28,930
were created and there was no space

1604
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:30,620
there is no space for them at sufficient

1605
01:18:28,930 --> 01:18:34,370
space for China I'm talking

1606
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:36,740
out say IMF World Bank I work at the

1607
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:38,750
OECD and there was endless questions

1608
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:40,940
among ambassadors among the staff

1609
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:43,010
whether we should like to to take a

1610
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:45,230
China on board as a another members

1611
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:47,840
Member State but then it appeared that

1612
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:50,000
Chinese do not want to be part of a ECD

1613
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,760
because they know that we're going

1614
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,310
stronger every day and in future the

1615
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:57,430
standards will not be imposed by the

1616
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:59,660
West but by gonna have to be negotiated

1617
01:18:57,430 --> 01:19:02,180
along with the Chinese and other

1618
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:04,490
emerging economies Steve let me just

1619
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:06,740
pick up on what youyou believe that the

1620
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:09,139
future world order is not entirely

1621
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:11,540
unknown how does what we've just heard

1622
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:14,510
from Parekh have to be calibrated by

1623
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:17,600
policymakers given the expectation that

1624
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:19,250
was put on leadership from those first

1625
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,960
few remarks this morning from the

1626
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:22,640
presidents and certainly the foreign

1627
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,110
minister yeah well let me talk a little

1628
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,120
bit about what those leaders are going

1629
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:28,570
to have to grapple with and things we do

1630
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:31,490
actually know if you think out 10 20 30

1631
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:33,590
40 years we actually know an enormous

1632
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:35,059
amount about what the population profile

1633
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:36,350
of the world will look like we know that

1634
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:38,480
China will have about a billion people

1635
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:40,940
so will India we know that the United

1636
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:42,919
States will have in excess of 400

1637
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:44,780
million people and by the way will be

1638
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:46,550
substantially younger than most of the

1639
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:48,530
industrialized world as a demographic

1640
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:50,600
profile we know that Europe's population

1641
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:52,820
is going to decline and is going to get

1642
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:54,410
older we know that the population of

1643
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:56,150
Russia is going to decline even more

1644
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:57,980
dramatically and get much older we know

1645
01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:00,290
that Japan is going to decline even more

1646
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:01,969
dramatically and get much older and we

1647
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:04,670
know that countries like Uganda Ethiopia

1648
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:07,550
and Nigeria other populations will

1649
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:07,850
double by 2050 think about that for a

1650
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:10,820
minute

1651
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:12,590
as you sit here in in Europe so we know

1652
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:13,969
a lot about the future world in terms of

1653
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:16,280
population we also know a lot about

1654
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:18,470
wealth we know that the members of the

1655
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:20,690
g20 today are likely to be the members

1656
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:22,730
of the g20 going forward at least most

1657
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:25,610
of them we know that France will not

1658
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:27,950
turn into Bolivia we know that Burundi

1659
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:30,620
will not turn into Singapore in the next

1660
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:32,690
30 to 50 years that the countries that

1661
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:34,340
are wealthy and powerful today are going

1662
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:37,339
to be the countries that are wealthy and

1663
01:20:34,340 --> 01:20:40,130
powerful going forward how they manage

1664
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:42,170
their problems remains to be seen but

1665
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:43,920
what does that mean if you trace all

1666
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:45,780
these trends out

1667
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,239
relative importance will continue to go

1668
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:50,370
up I'm sorry to say as I sit here

1669
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:51,239
Europe's relative importance is going to

1670
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:53,070
decline

1671
01:20:51,239 --> 01:20:55,709
that doesn't mean Europe is declining as

1672
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:57,570
an absolute sense but as a relative

1673
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:59,670
share of wealth and power it's going to

1674
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:01,530
decline the United States I'm still

1675
01:20:59,670 --> 01:21:03,570
relatively optimistic if we don't

1676
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:07,380
inflict too many wounds upon ourselves

1677
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:09,239
and we're capable of doing that as we

1678
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:11,850
have seen but I'm relatively optimistic

1679
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:14,160
because all of the advantages the United

1680
01:21:11,850 --> 01:21:17,100
States has traditionally had in terms of

1681
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:21,000
geography Natural Resources innovative

1682
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:23,130
population etc will continue there are

1683
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,840
some things we don't know we don't know

1684
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:26,160
what the future alliance structure

1685
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,070
around the world is going to be because

1686
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:31,650
alliances are malleable NATO I think

1687
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:34,320
today is more fragile than it was 20 or

1688
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:36,449
30 years ago the American alliance

1689
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:39,030
system in Asia I believe will be

1690
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:42,480
maintained but is going to require some

1691
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:45,449
deft diplomatic maneuvering in the years

1692
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:48,480
ahead and it's more fragile than perhaps

1693
01:21:45,449 --> 01:21:50,879
would be ideal second we don't know what

1694
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:53,250
the future ideological environment looks

1695
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,310
like 30 or 40 years ago millions of

1696
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:58,260
people believed in Marxism Leninism

1697
01:21:55,310 --> 01:22:04,050
hardly anybody does anymore except in a

1698
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:06,960
few isolated university towns but the

1699
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:09,090
few and and extremist ideology such as

1700
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,520
the things that have inspired Isis were

1701
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:14,880
completely marginal 30 or 40 years ago

1702
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:17,610
if you look forward how ite ideologies

1703
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,190
norms around the world evolve much

1704
01:22:17,610 --> 01:22:22,830
harder to forecast that and my third

1705
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:24,540
very difficult to forecast unknown is

1706
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:26,519
what the nature of the scientific and

1707
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:29,550
technological environment is going to be

1708
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:31,260
we are in fact terrible at forecasting

1709
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:33,330
what the technological frontier is

1710
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:35,610
really going to be like because we're

1711
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:37,530
very bad at anticipating how different

1712
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:39,000
technologies will be combined in various

1713
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:41,730
ways and all we have to do is think

1714
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,890
about the last 40 50 hundred years of

1715
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:45,089
all the things that people got wrong

1716
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:47,190
about what was going to be

1717
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:50,880
technologically possible which means

1718
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:52,589
leaders in 2030 2040 2050 are going to

1719
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:54,840
be wrestling with scientific and

1720
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:57,600
technological possibilities in biology

1721
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,670
and artificial intelligence etc the

1722
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,530
haven't even been conceived of and

1723
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:04,050
that's what political institutions are

1724
01:23:01,530 --> 01:23:06,300
going to have to deal with if I add all

1725
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:08,610
this together I would basically

1726
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,560
characterized the period we're moving

1727
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:13,500
into as the third phase of the

1728
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,900
post-world War two order first phase was

1729
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:17,760
the bipolar Cold War the second phase

1730
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:20,280
was the brief period of American

1731
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,600
unipolar dominance and the third year I

1732
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:25,290
think is going to be a sort of

1733
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:27,450
multipolar but very lopsided uneven

1734
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:28,710
world where China in the United States

1735
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:31,200
they're the two most powerful countries

1736
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:33,750
not in that order I'd put the United

1737
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:36,210
States ahead and the other major powers

1738
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:38,700
will be distinctly less I want to end on

1739
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:40,830
just one final provocative generational

1740
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:43,679
note as we think about all the things

1741
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:45,630
that happened in 2016 we think about

1742
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:48,930
that in demographic and generational

1743
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:51,630
terms consider that if people older than

1744
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:54,120
I am I'm 61 if people older than I am

1745
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:56,520
were denied the right to vote in the

1746
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:59,640
major democracies that would have been

1747
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:03,000
no brexit there would be no president

1748
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:07,530
Trump marine lepen would have lost by an

1749
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,570
even larger margin right etc etc etc in

1750
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:11,969
other words many of the disturbing

1751
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:14,910
trends you can point to in our politics

1752
01:24:11,970 --> 01:24:17,940
over the last year or two are in part

1753
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:21,480
because old people continue to vote and

1754
01:24:17,940 --> 01:24:23,400
if you want to be an optimist those

1755
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:26,160
younger people are not likely to change

1756
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:28,349
their political views all that much so

1757
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:30,540
democratic politics may in fact be

1758
01:24:28,350 --> 01:24:30,960
improving once people like me get out of

1759
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:33,269
the way

1760
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:35,790
thank you Steve do you want me to shift

1761
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:38,370
this discussion to ban the vote the old

1762
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:39,810
people know all right that was not a

1763
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,280
proposal that was an empirical

1764
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:44,880
observation think you've just made a

1765
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:46,500
headline but Jonathan I'm not going to

1766
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,780
suggest which generation you're from

1767
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:50,850
Jonathan Isle from Lucy and Natalie do

1768
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:52,650
you want to come in on China what you

1769
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:53,850
heard from Perec would you just like to

1770
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:54,990
pick up these points at all

1771
01:24:53,850 --> 01:24:58,320
yeah the microphone there please

1772
01:24:54,990 --> 01:25:00,300
Jonathan well I just just one say your

1773
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,070
challenge Stephen the sad thing about

1774
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:05,430
young people is they also tend to get

1775
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:07,110
old the people who voted for brexit now

1776
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:09,820
were the people who voted to stay in the

1777
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:11,769
European Union when Britain voted in 97

1778
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:15,099
five that's the sad thing about young

1779
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:17,199
people now to just do a more direct

1780
01:25:15,099 --> 01:25:20,770
question on China if I may on the

1781
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:22,629
subject of Stefan's point the it's a

1782
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:25,510
false dichotomy that you are putting

1783
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:26,829
nobody is arguing about isolating China

1784
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:28,449
or ignoring China

1785
01:25:26,829 --> 01:25:32,290
the question is what kind of an

1786
01:25:28,449 --> 01:25:34,839
engagement with China now the Chinese to

1787
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:37,179
simply scoop up all the high technology

1788
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:41,260
firms in Europe which is what they're

1789
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:43,500
doing now under the win-win definition

1790
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:46,750
which usually means the China wins twice

1791
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:50,860
so that that is that is the first point

1792
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:53,050
and the second point to Stefan and you

1793
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:56,199
said Marxism is dead but with this

1794
01:25:53,050 --> 01:26:00,480
alliance of autocracies this view of

1795
01:25:56,199 --> 01:26:04,540
China as a successful autocratic system

1796
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:07,150
that produces generates goods with that

1797
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:09,190
poison the liberal order that we have

1798
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:11,170
right Steven Stefan and Yahoo just stack

1799
01:26:09,190 --> 01:26:13,989
up one moment Natalie on particular on

1800
01:26:11,170 --> 01:26:19,270
just on China well we've had what piraka

1801
01:26:13,989 --> 01:26:21,879
said please yes thank those were very

1802
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:27,000
very interesting maps my question I

1803
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:28,960
suppose is how do we take that in and

1804
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,869
defend some of the things that were said

1805
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:34,150
earlier today which is that are the

1806
01:26:31,869 --> 01:26:36,280
global order or the and the and and the

1807
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:39,960
institutions that we care about are

1808
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:42,670
based on values so how do we embrace

1809
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,409
China's rise if you want to look at it

1810
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:48,239
in a very positive way which is which

1811
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:53,049
was I think the tone of your your talk

1812
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:55,900
while keeping in mind that we are values

1813
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:58,570
based democracies and I think that's

1814
01:26:55,900 --> 01:27:01,809
going to be a key issue just one one

1815
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:03,909
example of this we always we spend so

1816
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:06,579
much time analyzing Russian propaganda

1817
01:27:03,909 --> 01:27:10,509
what are we going to do tomorrow when

1818
01:27:06,579 --> 01:27:14,590
actually China starts spreading more you

1819
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:16,630
know of its notion of news and influence

1820
01:27:14,590 --> 01:27:19,630
across Europe how do we deal with that

1821
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:21,880
they are doing it already I think Steve

1822
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:23,090
there was question to you but aperitivo

1823
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:23,989
and Stefan you've been

1824
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:26,239
dealing with them as a foreign minister

1825
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:28,339
recently what what picking up both what

1826
01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:29,989
Natalie and Jonathan have said does

1827
01:27:28,340 --> 01:27:31,520
anyone else want to come in on on China

1828
01:27:29,989 --> 01:27:33,230
specifically okay I'll come to you in a

1829
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:37,010
moment please we should not

1830
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:39,440
underestimate oh sorry let me sit down

1831
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:42,290
to the moment we should not

1832
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:45,440
underestimate the challenges but we

1833
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:47,269
should face the challenges and so of

1834
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,638
course it's awfully difficult to

1835
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:52,130
negotiate with a country like China but

1836
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:55,310
we need to do so and we need to do so

1837
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:58,460
open eyes but we cannot pretend that if

1838
01:27:55,310 --> 01:28:03,440
we don't do it will avoid the problem if

1839
01:27:58,460 --> 01:28:05,750
we go with as I said megaphone politics

1840
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,750
bite us to the sidelines and to

1841
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:10,540
criticize China and to pull out which

1842
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:16,040
way will improve the situation in China

1843
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:18,290
so no I think we need to to to face the

1844
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:20,630
world and I'm convinced and then our

1845
01:28:18,290 --> 01:28:23,960
democratic tools will be assets for us

1846
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:27,170
if we will use them wisely facing the

1847
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:28,760
autocratic world I have you raised those

1848
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:30,679
points that naturally raised about

1849
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,719
values particularly in your bilateral

1850
01:28:30,679 --> 01:28:35,599
discussions with China and what what's

1851
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:38,780
it like when you do I think our values

1852
01:28:35,599 --> 01:28:41,050
are key and one of them is the sense of

1853
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:43,790
responsibility that means what are the

1854
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:46,280
consequences of what we are doing for

1855
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:49,760
others and for ourselves because if we

1856
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:52,159
have abstract concepts a conception of

1857
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,080
all values saying since they are not a

1858
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:56,509
democracy they don't have the rule of

1859
01:28:54,080 --> 01:29:00,619
law will not deal with them will ignore

1860
01:28:56,510 --> 01:29:03,260
them will bash them then what are the

1861
01:29:00,619 --> 01:29:05,360
consequences of this behavior in which

1862
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:07,099
way it will improve the world we know

1863
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:10,848
that the will has been improved but the

1864
01:29:07,099 --> 01:29:13,699
will is far to be perfect State so then

1865
01:29:10,849 --> 01:29:14,989
engage the world strong of your values

1866
01:29:13,699 --> 01:29:16,909
and your convictions we're not going to

1867
01:29:14,989 --> 01:29:18,468
stay on China indefinitely but there are

1868
01:29:16,909 --> 01:29:20,629
important points here about global

1869
01:29:18,469 --> 01:29:22,699
trends let Steve exactly and I would say

1870
01:29:20,630 --> 01:29:25,460
we shouldn't overestimate the degree to

1871
01:29:22,699 --> 01:29:27,830
which the Chinese model such as it is is

1872
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:29,750
attractive to others all right I will be

1873
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:32,630
far more concerned when I discover

1874
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:35,480
European and American billionaires

1875
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:36,889
buying condominiums in Shanghai because

1876
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,688
they want a safe place to go

1877
01:29:36,889 --> 01:29:40,880
- if everything falls apart in the West

1878
01:29:38,689 --> 01:29:43,159
as opposed to what's happening now where

1879
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:46,070
Russian oligarchs buy real estate in

1880
01:29:43,159 --> 01:29:49,070
London and where Chinese millionaires

1881
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:50,419
want to get visas and property in the

1882
01:29:49,070 --> 01:29:52,938
United States so that they have

1883
01:29:50,419 --> 01:29:54,800
someplace to go that suggests that there

1884
01:29:52,939 --> 01:29:56,539
is something about the Western model

1885
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,079
that they find attractive whether it's

1886
01:29:56,539 --> 01:30:02,509
stable property rights rule of law

1887
01:29:59,079 --> 01:30:05,239
places to educate their children and air

1888
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:07,099
you can breathe all of those things are

1889
01:30:05,239 --> 01:30:09,138
relatively appealing so I don't think we

1890
01:30:07,099 --> 01:30:11,599
want to be selling ourselves too short

1891
01:30:09,139 --> 01:30:12,679
too soon all right let me just pick up

1892
01:30:11,599 --> 01:30:14,599
on some of these critical issues

1893
01:30:12,679 --> 01:30:15,979
particularly what values what Jonathan

1894
01:30:14,599 --> 01:30:20,059
was saying but also the other point

1895
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:21,709
about the robotize ation the automation

1896
01:30:20,059 --> 01:30:23,749
that's coming in the artificial

1897
01:30:21,709 --> 01:30:25,789
intelligence the algorithms which in the

1898
01:30:23,749 --> 01:30:28,159
end as we've seen with Foxconn and other

1899
01:30:25,789 --> 01:30:30,349
companies in China are already

1900
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:33,110
destroying jobs what does that mean for

1901
01:30:30,349 --> 01:30:34,669
the stability of China let's start with

1902
01:30:33,110 --> 01:30:36,409
the question about sort of world order

1903
01:30:34,669 --> 01:30:38,090
because it's not really first and

1904
01:30:36,409 --> 01:30:39,558
foremost of values-based question it's

1905
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:42,050
about the distribution of power and

1906
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:44,030
steve is right the relative power of

1907
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:45,919
Europe and even the United States some

1908
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:47,300
extent is declining we're moving into a

1909
01:30:45,919 --> 01:30:49,099
multipolar world but it's not a

1910
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:51,739
multipolar world in the sense that we

1911
01:30:49,099 --> 01:30:53,689
know from European history it's a global

1912
01:30:51,739 --> 01:30:56,089
multipolar situation where you have

1913
01:30:53,689 --> 01:30:58,130
super powers great powers on every

1914
01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:00,019
continent at the same time that are

1915
01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:01,999
freely developing various kinds of

1916
01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:05,659
relationships with each other some based

1917
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:07,219
on values such as trans-pacific security

1918
01:31:05,659 --> 01:31:09,919
arrangements that the United States has

1919
01:31:07,219 --> 01:31:11,829
with Japan and with South Korea in other

1920
01:31:09,919 --> 01:31:13,820
cases just based purely on

1921
01:31:11,829 --> 01:31:17,058
complementarities on supply and demand

1922
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:20,090
so the fact that Europe has already such

1923
01:31:17,059 --> 01:31:21,679
deepening relations across Eurasia with

1924
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:23,239
China and other Asian countries doesn't

1925
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,189
mean that you are suddenly importing

1926
01:31:23,239 --> 01:31:27,409
Chinese values that the fact is that

1927
01:31:25,189 --> 01:31:29,479
right here this country Slovakia and

1928
01:31:27,409 --> 01:31:32,839
also Hungary have built into their

1929
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:35,239
economic plans to be passageways hubs

1930
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:37,760
junctions for Chinese build railways

1931
01:31:35,239 --> 01:31:39,379
coming to Europe and even from railways

1932
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,329
coming up from the Piraeus port of

1933
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:43,579
Greece up through here through Central

1934
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:45,648
Europe so already European countries are

1935
01:31:43,579 --> 01:31:47,389
reorienting their economic thinking

1936
01:31:45,649 --> 01:31:49,189
around the growing trade and

1937
01:31:47,389 --> 01:31:49,710
relationships of Asia that doesn't mean

1938
01:31:49,189 --> 01:31:52,800
that

1939
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:54,750
only you are becoming Asian in terms of

1940
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,820
values what one can transpire without

1941
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:58,800
the other and that opportunism that

1942
01:31:56,820 --> 01:32:00,900
commercial opportunism that European

1943
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:02,489
countries are our pursuing is of course

1944
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:04,730
very important for your for your

1945
01:32:02,489 --> 01:32:07,589
economic growth a country like Germany

1946
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:09,299
for example is getting attacked by the

1947
01:32:07,590 --> 01:32:11,580
United States Treasury for having large

1948
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:13,320
trade surpluses but meanwhile from their

1949
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:15,960
point of view they are finding ready

1950
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:17,519
markets for their exports in the Middle

1951
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:19,020
East in Asia and they are aggressively

1952
01:32:17,520 --> 01:32:21,570
looking outward and so clearly that's

1953
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:23,400
one reason why the German economy is so

1954
01:32:21,570 --> 01:32:24,269
strong and others in Europe want to be

1955
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:27,150
like that as well

1956
01:32:24,270 --> 01:32:29,550
now what Asia is doing when you refer to

1957
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:31,730
these job displacing technologies is

1958
01:32:29,550 --> 01:32:34,110
trying to move away from being primarily

1959
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:35,790
commodities or manufacturing driven

1960
01:32:34,110 --> 01:32:37,139
particularly the manufacturing that has

1961
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:40,100
been the cause of the East Asian

1962
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:42,989
economic miracle of course a lot jobs in

1963
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:44,430
emerging markets in those labor

1964
01:32:42,989 --> 01:32:46,049
intensive areas that have been the

1965
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:47,310
drivers of economic growth and

1966
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:49,350
prosperity those jobs are going to

1967
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:52,110
disappear a lot faster than anyone

1968
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:53,820
thought they would and as they do that's

1969
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:55,860
going to put pressure on Asian countries

1970
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:57,570
to focus much more on services and on

1971
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:59,040
consumption and that means they're going

1972
01:32:57,570 --> 01:33:00,090
to have to obviously liberalize their

1973
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,410
economies more they're gonna have to

1974
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:03,270
prop up the social pressure on

1975
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:05,280
governments there is a lot of pressure

1976
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:06,900
on government remember that these are

1977
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,670
countries with very large populations

1978
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:10,620
like China but they also have very high

1979
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:13,770
savings rates right and they have very

1980
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:14,430
large they don't necessarily have even

1981
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:16,320
if they don't have current account

1982
01:33:14,430 --> 01:33:18,239
surpluses they have very large savings

1983
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:20,610
they have large currency reserves and

1984
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:22,650
they are in the position to invest

1985
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:23,940
evermore capital that's what they have

1986
01:33:22,650 --> 01:33:26,099
been doing let's remember that when it

1987
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:28,379
comes to China every time you turn on a

1988
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:30,239
western television station like CNBC or

1989
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:31,710
Bloomberg you're going to have ten

1990
01:33:30,239 --> 01:33:33,780
people one after the other

1991
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:35,280
say that China has been over investing

1992
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:36,960
it needs to stop investing there all

1993
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,940
these ghost cities and it needs to start

1994
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,190
just consuming consuming consuming the

1995
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:43,049
truth is that China does both right it

1996
01:33:41,190 --> 01:33:44,250
invests a lot and it consumes a lot and

1997
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:47,700
that investment has been absolutely

1998
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:49,860
critical as a driver of new new areas of

1999
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:51,900
the economy like e-commerce the reason

2000
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:53,880
Alibaba is a multi hundred billion

2001
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:55,019
dollar company today is because of all

2002
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:56,250
the infrastructure investments so

2003
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:58,830
they're they are finding ways to

2004
01:33:56,250 --> 01:34:00,120
continue to create jobs even as jobs are

2005
01:33:58,830 --> 01:34:01,559
getting lost through automation right

2006
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:03,120
what I'm doing is layering this

2007
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,590
discussion and Stefan is going to give

2008
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:05,450
us some

2009
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:07,400
arts in a moment to take forward some of

2010
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:08,780
the discussion points but picking up on

2011
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:10,790
what all of them have said let me just

2012
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:11,960
recognize two others please I can only

2013
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:14,150
just see you can have some lights on

2014
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:16,700
here Kevin thank you hi I'm Matt Rhodes

2015
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:19,009
from the George C Marshall Center one of

2016
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:20,870
the usual suspect issues for future

2017
01:34:19,010 --> 01:34:23,150
security panels that hasn't been issued

2018
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:25,130
is hasn't been mentioned much is climate

2019
01:34:23,150 --> 01:34:27,530
change I'd be interested if the pan was

2020
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:29,210
to imagine that affecting geopolitics

2021
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,769
and geo economics right let's just pause

2022
01:34:29,210 --> 01:34:33,500
that ambassador do you want to come in

2023
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:34,850
on China yes I do think because China is

2024
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:36,410
something that Australia is wrestling

2025
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:38,090
with well let me just first say we've

2026
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:40,550
been watching China incredibly closely

2027
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:42,140
for twenty years so we and our

2028
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:44,870
relationship with China is a very strong

2029
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:46,370
one has two parts to it and we do have a

2030
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:47,960
free trade agreement with China we're

2031
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:50,300
very happy with it we also have one with

2032
01:34:47,960 --> 01:34:52,610
Japan and one with South Korea which is

2033
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:54,140
tremendous for our economy and China is

2034
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:55,580
a tremendous source of investment and

2035
01:34:54,140 --> 01:34:57,530
it's a great country and it's going to

2036
01:34:55,580 --> 01:35:00,710
be an even greater country so engagement

2037
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:03,019
is crucial but how do you engage and let

2038
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:04,970
me say we do a number of other things in

2039
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:06,440
terms of our conversations with China we

2040
01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:09,170
have a very active human rights dialogue

2041
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:11,169
with China and the best method we've

2042
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:13,910
found with China is be direct and

2043
01:35:11,170 --> 01:35:15,710
challenge the values because the big

2044
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:17,750
question is what will China do with its

2045
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:19,820
future greatness will it be a part of a

2046
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:21,590
rules-based international system or will

2047
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:24,019
it try and stand outside and get

2048
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:25,400
outcomes by using raw power and I don't

2049
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,610
think any of us want the latter

2050
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:31,309
but you have been concerned about the

2051
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:33,679
buying up of Darwin the push back on

2052
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:35,210
trying to buy ranches like Kidman in

2053
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,550
other words it doesn't come with a

2054
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:39,350
comfortable relationship well it's not a

2055
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:41,870
bad relationship the only reason that

2056
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:44,120
we've said no to some Chinese

2057
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:47,210
investments is because there's been a

2058
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:50,000
national security dimension but almost

2059
01:35:47,210 --> 01:35:52,610
all Chinese bids for investment in

2060
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,080
Australia are accepted we're quite happy

2061
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:55,610
we're quite happy with that foreign

2062
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,590
investment on the other hand we're not

2063
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:58,849
at all happy with how China's been

2064
01:35:57,590 --> 01:36:01,550
acquiring territory in the South China

2065
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:03,290
Sea so you can do both and I think

2066
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:03,740
European countries already know about

2067
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,300
this

2068
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:07,010
it's a rough patch with Russia at the

2069
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:09,830
moment but for many many years people

2070
01:36:07,010 --> 01:36:11,420
managed to work with Russia whilst at

2071
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:13,280
the same time standing up to Russia on

2072
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:14,910
some issues and Chinese students are

2073
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,009
keeping many universities in

2074
01:36:14,910 --> 01:36:19,080
in the in the black absolutely right

2075
01:36:17,010 --> 01:36:21,720
please can you keep all your remarks

2076
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:23,070
preachers little mention of India hang

2077
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,840
on we're still talking about China at

2078
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:27,150
the service so yes you know what China

2079
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:29,640
by China little mention of India in

2080
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:32,519
connection both with China the one belt

2081
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:34,110
initiative and it's rivalry and also

2082
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:36,360
when are we going to address the

2083
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:37,769
question of values with question of

2084
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:39,269
whether we've already talked about that

2085
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:42,390
ten minutes ago it's good to be a

2086
01:36:39,270 --> 01:36:43,920
microphone there Thank You Teresa Fallon

2087
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:46,920
Center for Russia Europe Asia studies

2088
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,260
three points you mentioned the belton

2089
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:50,940
Road initiative conference but no one

2090
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:52,560
mentioned how Moody's downgraded China's

2091
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:53,700
credit rating on Monday so it kind of

2092
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,800
took the shine off the Belton Road

2093
01:36:53,700 --> 01:36:57,480
initiative the Europeans refused to sign

2094
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:58,980
the document so it doesn't show that

2095
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:02,940
European cooperation the Europeans are

2096
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:04,440
very annoyed by the lack of openness

2097
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:06,570
into the Chinese what we're looking for

2098
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:09,030
though is strategic okay right changes

2099
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:11,429
and so rhetoric trend true but you you

2100
01:37:09,030 --> 01:37:13,139
had this incredible map and it makes it

2101
01:37:11,430 --> 01:37:14,730
appear that it's inevitable but the

2102
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:17,970
reality is that the Chinese economy is

2103
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:19,980
slowing down and the trains going that

2104
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:22,500
you mentioned across Eurasia to Europe

2105
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:24,929
are returning empty so we call it oh bow

2106
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:27,870
one belt one way so how can this

2107
01:37:24,930 --> 01:37:31,800
continue that's the issue about

2108
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:33,750
connectivity and okay and what about

2109
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:35,400
this post globalization world that

2110
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:36,990
Credit Suisse talks about we're assuming

2111
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,549
that this is what the world's going to

2112
01:37:36,990 --> 01:37:40,590
look like but the world has changed

2113
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:42,240
we've had three decades of China growing

2114
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:44,430
very rapidly but now it's slowing down

2115
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,900
so this isn't inevitable thing just pick

2116
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:49,290
up on that in a minute one was is about

2117
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:51,299
China yeah Alan rally is just a craft my

2118
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:53,820
point about China is simply this the

2119
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:55,830
strategic play for the west and the lady

2120
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:57,690
was referring to this little in a

2121
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:59,730
previous question the strategic issue is

2122
01:37:57,690 --> 01:38:01,530
we've had 35 years of enormous amounts

2123
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:03,150
of growth and the idea is for

2124
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:05,009
policymakers that this will continue on

2125
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:07,830
a straight line trajectory this surely

2126
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:11,340
isn't true the the key step I would give

2127
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:13,440
you for this is the total Chinese debt

2128
01:38:11,340 --> 01:38:16,470
corporate local and central as 200 III

2129
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:18,450
percent of GDP look the key thing is is

2130
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:22,110
that two-thirds of that has been

2131
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:23,460
generated since 2008 and it's the devil

2132
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:25,830
when you understand the level of debt

2133
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:27,540
creation we realize charlie'll probably

2134
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:28,619
won't collapse but we're looking at is

2135
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:31,619
stagnation

2136
01:38:28,619 --> 01:38:34,799
and how you do deal not with the PR of

2137
01:38:31,619 --> 01:38:38,009
one belt one road but the reality of

2138
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:40,889
long terms Chinese stagnation and what

2139
01:38:38,010 --> 01:38:43,379
is the Western response to that and it

2140
01:38:40,889 --> 01:38:46,349
seems to me that the issue of stagnation

2141
01:38:43,379 --> 01:38:48,719
is actually the early to mid 21st

2142
01:38:46,349 --> 01:38:50,699
century issue of how we deal with China

2143
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:52,379
and indeed or a issue that China has to

2144
01:38:50,699 --> 01:38:53,999
deal itself right I'm going to just have

2145
01:38:52,379 --> 01:38:55,679
one round on the on the panel then move

2146
01:38:53,999 --> 01:38:57,929
on to other issues from Stephan can lead

2147
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,070
on that Stephan again your your

2148
01:38:57,929 --> 01:39:00,300
assessment I know your your

2149
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:02,789
responsibility is Europe at the moment

2150
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:04,409
but more broadly when you're looking at

2151
01:39:02,789 --> 01:39:06,629
and you hear that that worry about

2152
01:39:04,409 --> 01:39:10,530
stagnation is there danger of seeing

2153
01:39:06,629 --> 01:39:14,189
China just moving up but China will move

2154
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:17,699
up if we move down that come in

2155
01:39:14,189 --> 01:39:20,579
comparison with us but can we then focus

2156
01:39:17,699 --> 01:39:23,129
on our strengths as well and can we make

2157
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:27,209
the right decisions as countries and

2158
01:39:23,129 --> 01:39:28,559
governments and populations if I may

2159
01:39:27,209 --> 01:39:31,499
come back to the question that being

2160
01:39:28,559 --> 01:39:31,860
asked to ask back to that in a moment if

2161
01:39:31,499 --> 01:39:34,800
I may

2162
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:37,978
I just wanted then cap China and then

2163
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:40,590
move on to your points if I may I think

2164
01:39:37,979 --> 01:39:45,919
we have strengths that China doesn't and

2165
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:51,629
one of them is democracy circulation of

2166
01:39:45,919 --> 01:39:55,079
ideas scientific freedom academic life a

2167
01:39:51,629 --> 01:39:57,689
free press able to criticize us when we

2168
01:39:55,079 --> 01:40:00,949
are making mistakes the ability to say

2169
01:39:57,689 --> 01:40:05,459
the truth about the estimation of our

2170
01:40:00,949 --> 01:40:08,969
environment or water management due to

2171
01:40:05,459 --> 01:40:11,489
everfree justice system we cannot

2172
01:40:08,969 --> 01:40:15,629
underestimate what that means and in

2173
01:40:11,489 --> 01:40:19,018
which way it means it may make difficult

2174
01:40:15,629 --> 01:40:21,419
for China to cope with what we are able

2175
01:40:19,019 --> 01:40:23,519
to achieve if we use these tools

2176
01:40:21,419 --> 01:40:25,019
properly and it's what I would like to

2177
01:40:23,519 --> 01:40:26,969
develop now Steve is there a danger of

2178
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:28,550
saying things only in extra bleh in one

2179
01:40:26,969 --> 01:40:31,739
direction with a country like China

2180
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:33,119
absolutely I would just reinforce the

2181
01:40:31,739 --> 01:40:34,978
point that was made here with another

2182
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:36,659
observation that of course if you look

2183
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:38,489
at China's population it's going to have

2184
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:41,929
by far the world's largest elderly

2185
01:40:38,489 --> 01:40:44,120
population in fact it's in

2186
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:45,980
joy Dover it's remarkable run over the

2187
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:48,530
last 30 or 40 years a really almost

2188
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:50,990
perfect demographic profile with a very

2189
01:40:48,530 --> 01:40:52,639
large slug of population in their prime

2190
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:54,889
employment years their most productive

2191
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:57,080
years that's about to change because of

2192
01:40:54,890 --> 01:40:58,670
the one-child policy they actually are

2193
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:00,890
going to have a huge labor shortage

2194
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:03,920
having to support all of those

2195
01:41:00,890 --> 01:41:05,860
increasingly elderly people so China is

2196
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:07,670
about to hit a part of perfect storm

2197
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:08,540
demographically in terms of its own

2198
01:41:07,670 --> 01:41:09,980
productivity

2199
01:41:08,540 --> 01:41:11,630
I don't think China is going to collapse

2200
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:14,120
or anything like that agents but

2201
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:17,000
certainly certain sea stagnation is a

2202
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:18,650
real issue there's a seventh set of

2203
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
issues which perhaps we'll get to on

2204
01:41:18,650 --> 01:41:21,530
what this means for the sort of

2205
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,030
geopolitics of Asia but I think we've

2206
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:25,280
got to move on to some higher tech

2207
01:41:23,030 --> 01:41:26,240
nation cleric well I just want to get to

2208
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:28,550
one point versus which is about

2209
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:30,260
reciprocity so the concerns that and

2210
01:41:28,550 --> 01:41:32,000
this relates to values because when you

2211
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:34,010
deal with China as the gentleman from

2212
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,240
Australia said you know having values as

2213
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:37,400
an important part of the conversation

2214
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,590
and not wavering from that is important

2215
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:41,059
and demanding that they not come to your

2216
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:43,250
country and presume that they're still

2217
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:45,020
in their own is extremely important and

2218
01:41:43,250 --> 01:41:47,270
this applies very much in terms of trade

2219
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:49,190
and investment so you are within your

2220
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:51,770
rights to determine what is a national

2221
01:41:49,190 --> 01:41:53,660
what is a sort of strategic asset that

2222
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:55,550
foreign investors are not allowed to

2223
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:57,110
take ownership of every country in the

2224
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:58,910
world is now doing this this happened in

2225
01:41:57,110 --> 01:42:00,980
Canada after the Nexen deal where the

2226
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:03,260
Canadian government said you know this

2227
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:04,969
was this will be allowed this time but

2228
01:42:03,260 --> 01:42:06,680
not next time when it comes to upstream

2229
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:09,290
acquisition of energy assets

2230
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:11,060
just remember reciprocity just demand

2231
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:12,380
reciprocity that's why the European

2232
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:14,630
business community I think this is the

2233
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:17,780
implication that you had in your comment

2234
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:19,820
as well just demand that that everything

2235
01:42:17,780 --> 01:42:22,040
be mutual everything be reciprocal that

2236
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:24,049
it be win-win in the Western sense of

2237
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:25,790
when we're not in the Chinese sense of

2238
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:27,560
win-win is probably the best thing you

2239
01:42:25,790 --> 01:42:29,720
can do with China across the board trade

2240
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:33,080
investment values and so forth that's an

2241
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:37,520
in stagnation under the honest with you

2242
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:39,080
it's it's far to sort of oversimplify

2243
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:41,330
the conversation we're having about

2244
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:43,580
China a country and economy of that size

2245
01:42:41,330 --> 01:42:45,350
does not simply stagnate overnight not

2246
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:47,600
because of the level of debt in the

2247
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:49,850
economy and not because of the fact that

2248
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:51,620
it's an aging population neither of

2249
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:55,370
those an addition to the other five

2250
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:55,849
major issues that China is confronting

2251
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:58,280
such as

2252
01:42:55,850 --> 01:43:00,230
environmental issues and and obviously

2253
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:02,059
concerns about the future of its

2254
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:04,580
political evolution you can take all of

2255
01:43:02,060 --> 01:43:06,830
the problems that China has and after

2256
01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:08,059
all every problem that China has is the

2257
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:11,150
biggest problem in the history of the

2258
01:43:08,060 --> 01:43:13,970
world and yet still it's not going to

2259
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:16,309
mean that that China and Asia more

2260
01:43:13,970 --> 01:43:19,040
broadly is not going to be wedded to and

2261
01:43:16,310 --> 01:43:21,110
bought into and and participating in

2262
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:24,019
this broader Asian growth story and

2263
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:25,820
China's composition or China's driving

2264
01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:27,770
that story may decline but others are

2265
01:43:25,820 --> 01:43:29,210
going to step up and in India actually

2266
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:31,520
is one of them of course because India

2267
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:34,700
now has that perfect demographic profile

2268
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:36,680
it won't even reach having the majority

2269
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:38,870
of its population of peak working age

2270
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:40,280
until actually past the year 2030 and

2271
01:43:38,870 --> 01:43:42,440
it's already the world's fastest growing

2272
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:44,719
economy it did not send an official

2273
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:46,940
presence to the one belt one road summit

2274
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:48,590
for diplomatic reasons but far more

2275
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:50,389
importantly than any one particular

2276
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:52,070
event is the fact that it's the second

2277
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:53,990
largest shareholder in the Asian

2278
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:56,420
infrastructure investment bank so it

2279
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:58,370
wants to be a part of and every country

2280
01:43:56,420 --> 01:43:59,630
surrounding China and China has more

2281
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:03,559
neighbors than any country in the world

2282
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:05,720
pop quiz for you geography buffs and so

2283
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:07,940
every country wants to be a part of that

2284
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:09,140
growing connectivity and they're going

2285
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:11,780
to continue to and that's going to be

2286
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:13,130
part of a part of a new model of Chinese

2287
01:44:11,780 --> 01:44:14,509
growth if you will because they're going

2288
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:16,640
to keep exports strong as those

2289
01:44:14,510 --> 01:44:18,260
economies grow they're going to be input

2290
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:19,670
they're going to be asset owners of all

2291
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:20,900
of these infrastructures that are being

2292
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:22,370
built they're going to generate revenues

2293
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:24,230
from that from utilities from the

2294
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:25,880
transportation there's all sorts of ways

2295
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:28,160
in which China will continue to grow

2296
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:30,230
that most people aren't really talking

2297
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:31,309
about right now all right now we've got

2298
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:33,320
25 minutes to run

2299
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:35,210
let me Stefan let me pick up with I said

2300
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:37,340
we were going to do it in stages

2301
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:39,830
let's meet go to the fourth stage now

2302
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:41,870
your your thoughts about the trends

2303
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:44,240
which are coming down the track which

2304
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:47,960
can be either identified or at least

2305
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:49,760
pointed to Thank You Nick I will come

2306
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:52,160
back to the question that has been asked

2307
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:55,160
to us to prepare ourselves for this

2308
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:58,639
panel and it was a how can we keep the

2309
01:44:55,160 --> 01:45:00,559
world safe and moving forward with so

2310
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:04,130
many contradictory interests and

2311
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:07,870
challenges so I thought my mind racing

2312
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:11,270
is so prestigious moment how can I

2313
01:45:07,870 --> 01:45:15,580
calculate what I have to say and my view

2314
01:45:11,270 --> 01:45:19,070
is these interests are not contradictory

2315
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:22,100
they must be not only balance is not the

2316
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:25,340
right word they should be combined in a

2317
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:28,010
way to reinforce each others let me give

2318
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:31,970
you some examples and if we do that I'm

2319
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:34,100
confident that when when the wisdom

2320
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:35,990
Kiska said we need to be optimistic and

2321
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:37,910
we should not over react to every

2322
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:40,309
problems I think it's completely right

2323
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:42,830
if we choose this idea that we may

2324
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:45,320
reconcile our goals instead of opposing

2325
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:48,019
them I will give you a couple of example

2326
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:51,290
first example I have in mind is NATO

2327
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:53,870
meetings I yeah it's my third little

2328
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:56,450
meeting yesterday at the beginning the

2329
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:59,210
first one there were a big division

2330
01:45:56,450 --> 01:46:01,429
within NATO about the attitude facing

2331
01:45:59,210 --> 01:46:04,520
Russia and there were the one that they

2332
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:08,800
were arguing for deterrence and orders

2333
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:11,540
for dialogue and yesterday there were

2334
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:14,930
consensus that we need both and which

2335
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:17,420
not oppose the two Canada has increased

2336
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:20,120
its sanctions against Russia increase

2337
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:22,480
its support concrete support to crane

2338
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:25,190
and increases dialogue with Russia

2339
01:46:22,480 --> 01:46:28,009
because we know that the goal is to find

2340
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:30,860
the path to reconciliation in order to

2341
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:33,230
avoid estimation where we are spending

2342
01:46:30,860 --> 01:46:35,960
so much of an investments in resources

2343
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:37,940
to have deterrence in the East part of

2344
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:41,390
Europe instead of working all together

2345
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:43,790
to develop Africa and to strengthen

2346
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:46,070
relationship with Asia in order to go

2347
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:48,769
there we need both deterrence and

2348
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:50,960
dialogue there is a consensus on this

2349
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:53,720
right policy another example and they

2350
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:55,340
give to you is there are some that are

2351
01:46:53,720 --> 01:47:00,110
telling us in order to have economic

2352
01:46:55,340 --> 01:47:02,930
growth you need now to build this only

2353
01:47:00,110 --> 01:47:05,870
on the market and to stop to have the

2354
01:47:02,930 --> 01:47:08,660
only spending and social programs and so

2355
01:47:05,870 --> 01:47:10,460
on that's that's a big mistake we have

2356
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:13,370
all the evidence that shows that the

2357
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:16,520
path to economic growth is fighting and

2358
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:19,130
equalities fighting inequalities in a

2359
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:21,170
way that is it is clever but it's clear

2360
01:47:19,130 --> 01:47:23,630
that the societies that are

2361
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:26,660
strongest economies have large middle

2362
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:29,060
class they held up their their kids to

2363
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:31,880
find the ways to develop their talents

2364
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:34,310
they are safe in the streets they have

2365
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:36,530
good schools good hospitals they invest

2366
01:47:34,310 --> 01:47:39,650
in it invest in their universities and

2367
01:47:36,530 --> 01:47:42,290
it's what we are decided to do on their

2368
01:47:39,650 --> 01:47:44,330
justin trudeau to be sure that canada

2369
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:46,580
will have a strong middle class we have

2370
01:47:44,330 --> 01:47:49,640
asked the richest part of our country

2371
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:51,620
the 1% the richest to contribute more in

2372
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:55,400
order to give a tax release to the

2373
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:58,160
middle class we have invested a lot in a

2374
01:47:55,400 --> 01:48:00,710
childhood development because this is

2375
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:03,260
the way to have a strong economy and

2376
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:05,630
another position that we are doing it at

2377
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:08,239
is completely false is diversity and

2378
01:48:05,630 --> 01:48:10,429
unity we are told that in order to

2379
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:12,589
protect the cohesion of our countries

2380
01:48:10,429 --> 01:48:15,320
we should close the door to too much

2381
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:19,160
diversity that will weaken our society

2382
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:21,650
if it's well done diversity will be an

2383
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:24,019
asset not a threat we have all the

2384
01:48:21,650 --> 01:48:25,280
evidence in Canada and elsewhere that

2385
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:27,260
the companies that are the most

2386
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:29,989
competitive in our markets are the ones

2387
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:32,739
that have been able to tackle the within

2388
01:48:29,989 --> 01:48:36,230
all the strengths of their workforce and

2389
01:48:32,739 --> 01:48:38,178
this diversity became an asset it's

2390
01:48:36,230 --> 01:48:40,699
certainly the case that my country has

2391
01:48:38,179 --> 01:48:43,040
been developed and if it's possible in

2392
01:48:40,699 --> 01:48:44,870
Canada I don't see why it would not be

2393
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:48,080
possible elsewhere in the world

2394
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:50,420
another example is trade and social

2395
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:52,670
progress it depends the way you

2396
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:56,449
negotiate a trade agreement of course it

2397
01:48:52,670 --> 01:48:59,390
may be raised to the bottom for worker

2398
01:48:56,449 --> 01:49:02,449
protections food safety and very tall

2399
01:48:59,390 --> 01:49:05,060
standards it may or it may not if you

2400
01:49:02,449 --> 01:49:07,370
negotiate negotiate it properly and I

2401
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:10,460
will argue strongly that what we

2402
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:13,340
Canada's negotiated with the EU the CETA

2403
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:15,530
agreement is exactly that we'll be

2404
01:49:13,340 --> 01:49:18,620
stronger for the environment stronger

2405
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:21,920
for worker workers rights food safety

2406
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:24,260
and so on and we'll have trade don't

2407
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:25,730
choose between the two and finally

2408
01:49:24,260 --> 01:49:28,160
climate change has been mentioned is a

2409
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:30,290
terrible threat for humankind we need to

2410
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:33,630
realise that at the end of the century

2411
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:37,550
if we have three to four degrees

2412
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:41,219
up to what it was in pre-industrial

2413
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:43,110
level in terms of warming it means that

2414
01:49:41,219 --> 01:49:45,630
life on this planet will be much more

2415
01:49:43,110 --> 01:49:48,299
difficult to sustain and we need to

2416
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:51,870
avoid it in even the Paris agreement if

2417
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:53,370
each country's reach their target of the

2418
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:55,380
previous agreement we are still in the

2419
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:57,630
world of three degree Celsius instead of

2420
01:49:55,380 --> 01:50:00,480
two degrees Celsius as we hope we will

2421
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:01,980
be so we need to work stronger on it but

2422
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:04,799
for that we should not oppose the

2423
01:50:01,980 --> 01:50:06,239
environment and the economy I bet you

2424
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,310
that the countries that will have the

2425
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:11,070
best economies will be the one that I

2426
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:14,850
will have less waste will have clean

2427
01:50:11,070 --> 01:50:17,940
tech technologies and clean sources of

2428
01:50:14,850 --> 01:50:20,820
energy and it that will invent the

2429
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:22,739
solutions and spread it to the world and

2430
01:50:20,820 --> 01:50:26,099
I only want that Canada will be one of

2431
01:50:22,739 --> 01:50:27,959
them and it's why argue my country for a

2432
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:30,929
strong policy regarding the environment

2433
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:33,590
that makes sense for the economic

2434
01:50:30,929 --> 01:50:37,920
development of Canada so inclusive and

2435
01:50:33,590 --> 01:50:40,530
sustainable growth is possible and it's

2436
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:42,480
something we need to achieve thank you

2437
01:50:40,530 --> 01:50:44,250
let me just pick up what the Foreign

2438
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:45,928
Minister said earlier about the

2439
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:47,670
challenges for leadership because in the

2440
01:50:45,929 --> 01:50:49,290
last 20 minutes let's focus on that

2441
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:51,420
picking up what all of you have just

2442
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:55,580
said yak have you talked about end of

2443
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:58,230
rules mindset and post truth society if

2444
01:50:55,580 --> 01:50:59,580
conformity is coming to an end and we

2445
01:50:58,230 --> 01:51:02,820
have the foreign minister saying

2446
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:05,159
leadership and vision is not should not

2447
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:07,080
be constantly reacting hasty and

2448
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:08,730
instinctive reactions are not good

2449
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:10,469
enough and there's a wit of the

2450
01:51:08,730 --> 01:51:13,559
president said there's a weak response

2451
01:51:10,469 --> 01:51:15,719
of political leaders what I'm getting at

2452
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:17,840
is what is the structure of governance

2453
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:21,090
in all of this which can make this

2454
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:23,130
manageable at least is this beyond now

2455
01:51:21,090 --> 01:51:25,139
leadership to handle this where the

2456
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:27,150
corporate leadership or political

2457
01:51:25,139 --> 01:51:29,699
leadership or are they constantly going

2458
01:51:27,150 --> 01:51:31,650
to be struggling to catch up one thought

2459
01:51:29,699 --> 01:51:34,080
for you at this point Steve the future

2460
01:51:31,650 --> 01:51:35,969
of major international institutions not

2461
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:39,420
just NATO but even the World Bank the

2462
01:51:35,969 --> 01:51:41,730
Bretton Woods Agreement I think they're

2463
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:44,370
they are probably intact for the

2464
01:51:41,730 --> 01:51:47,459
foreseeable future but the confidence in

2465
01:51:44,370 --> 01:51:48,599
them is has eroded somewhat

2466
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:51,719
but that's not where I would go with

2467
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:53,610
this if you don't mind I I think what

2468
01:51:51,719 --> 01:51:57,120
we're seeing in our politics of the last

2469
01:51:53,610 --> 01:51:59,160
year or two is not at all surprising we

2470
01:51:57,120 --> 01:52:00,750
began that post Cold War era with this

2471
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:03,570
extraordinary optimism

2472
01:52:00,750 --> 01:52:04,830
right the liberal market capitalism was

2473
01:52:03,570 --> 01:52:06,299
going to gradually spread around the

2474
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:09,210
world and everyone was going to be part

2475
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:11,370
of the end of history as it were and

2476
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:12,930
then people were told that you know you

2477
01:52:11,370 --> 01:52:15,120
could create the euro and that wasn't

2478
01:52:12,930 --> 01:52:17,100
going to lead to any problems and you

2479
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:18,510
could expand NATO endlessly and that

2480
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:19,950
wasn't going to lead to any problems and

2481
01:52:18,510 --> 01:52:21,540
you could keep increasing the size of

2482
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:22,920
the European Union and that wasn't going

2483
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:25,080
to lead to any problems you could

2484
01:52:22,920 --> 01:52:26,540
deregulate markets and that wouldn't

2485
01:52:25,080 --> 01:52:29,100
lead to any problems you could promote

2486
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:30,690
globalization everywhere that would not

2487
01:52:29,100 --> 01:52:32,850
cause any problems and you could invade

2488
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:34,080
Iraq and that would just solve problems

2489
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:36,690
and not create any new ones

2490
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:39,210
all right well after that track record

2491
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:41,129
and we're almost in none of the people

2492
01:52:39,210 --> 01:52:43,620
responsible for those various decisions

2493
01:52:41,130 --> 01:52:45,540
wherever really held responsible and we

2494
01:52:43,620 --> 01:52:47,219
then go through the financial crisis and

2495
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:48,810
we go through what's happened in Iraq

2496
01:52:47,219 --> 01:52:50,400
and we go through what's happened in the

2497
01:52:48,810 --> 01:52:54,030
rest of the Middle East and you ask

2498
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:57,089
yourself why suddenly in 2016 are people

2499
01:52:54,030 --> 01:52:59,309
everywhere not happy with current elites

2500
01:52:57,090 --> 01:53:01,920
and turning to people who not only

2501
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:03,840
promised the magical solutions but

2502
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:07,140
basically promised to take them back

2503
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:11,489
into the past to make a country great

2504
01:53:07,140 --> 01:53:13,260
again right as opposed to pointing them

2505
01:53:11,489 --> 01:53:15,030
towards the future it's not at all

2506
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:16,800
surprising at all so it seems to me the

2507
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:18,719
task of leadership going forward among

2508
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:21,510
other things is to start holding

2509
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:24,090
existing democratically elected leaders

2510
01:53:21,510 --> 01:53:27,480
and elites and the people who advise

2511
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:29,489
them somewhat more accountable for both

2512
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:31,530
what they do right but also for what

2513
01:53:29,489 --> 01:53:32,820
they do wrong I'm doing a big project on

2514
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:35,370
thinking the unthinkable which comes

2515
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:37,290
which shows very clearly most leaders in

2516
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:38,820
the corporate world and the political

2517
01:53:37,290 --> 01:53:41,010
world and the civil service public

2518
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:43,469
service world do not want to think how

2519
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:45,930
bad things could become you are from the

2520
01:53:43,469 --> 01:53:49,080
Kennedy School of Government so you know

2521
01:53:45,930 --> 01:53:51,300
everything you trained leaders of the

2522
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:53,070
future are you telling them to almost

2523
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:54,900
ignore much of what you teach them in

2524
01:53:53,070 --> 01:53:56,870
order to think differently the next

2525
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:59,610
generation that Parag represents

2526
01:53:56,870 --> 01:54:01,019
absolutely not what we tell them is not

2527
01:53:59,610 --> 01:54:02,880
oh yes absolutely

2528
01:54:01,020 --> 01:54:05,580
not we do not tell them to ignore

2529
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:07,890
everything they thought what we do tell

2530
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:10,170
them I think among other things is you

2531
01:54:07,890 --> 01:54:12,720
know obviously get trained in what the

2532
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:16,050
current sort of body of knowledge is but

2533
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:18,450
try to have as wide a range of sources

2534
01:54:16,050 --> 01:54:20,340
as possible in the central problem I

2535
01:54:18,450 --> 01:54:22,110
think that's at least in the United

2536
01:54:20,340 --> 01:54:24,690
States one of the reasons people have

2537
01:54:22,110 --> 01:54:27,500
been so surprised by the politics of the

2538
01:54:24,690 --> 01:54:29,669
last couple of years is the growing

2539
01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:32,310
compartmentalization of our societies

2540
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:34,980
people watch the TV shows that they like

2541
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:37,560
and watch the news programs that agree

2542
01:54:34,980 --> 01:54:39,179
with them they read the newspapers that

2543
01:54:37,560 --> 01:54:41,460
they already agree with their social

2544
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:43,650
circles are very homogeneous and

2545
01:54:41,460 --> 01:54:45,750
suddenly they discover that Donald Trump

2546
01:54:43,650 --> 01:54:47,879
is president because nobody they know

2547
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:51,420
voted for him so how could this possibly

2548
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:53,280
be true and so one of the things I try

2549
01:54:51,420 --> 01:54:56,580
to encourage my students is to you know

2550
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:58,710
make sure you read several newspapers

2551
01:54:56,580 --> 01:55:01,740
and not all of the same political stripe

2552
01:54:58,710 --> 01:55:03,750
read these news platforms news Platt

2553
01:55:01,740 --> 01:55:06,120
would that's exactly right don't just go

2554
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:08,820
to whichever websites you happen to like

2555
01:55:06,120 --> 01:55:10,440
try to don't follow on Twitter just

2556
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:12,809
people who have the same political views

2557
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:15,809
as you put a few people in your Twitter

2558
01:55:12,810 --> 01:55:17,430
feed who make you angry every time you

2559
01:55:15,810 --> 01:55:18,810
read what they put on because that's the

2560
01:55:17,430 --> 01:55:20,820
only way you're going to have some sense

2561
01:55:18,810 --> 01:55:22,500
of what the current of opinion are and

2562
01:55:20,820 --> 01:55:24,269
occasionally some of the people you

2563
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:26,100
disagree with are actually going to turn

2564
01:55:24,270 --> 01:55:27,630
out to be right all right all of us are

2565
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:28,680
in dark suits standing up here I do want

2566
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:30,330
to hear from other people who are not

2567
01:55:28,680 --> 01:55:31,230
wearing dark suits and maybe come from

2568
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:33,540
the next generation

2569
01:55:31,230 --> 01:55:36,690
Perik you are still just a millennial

2570
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:38,820
barely by couple of couple months but

2571
01:55:36,690 --> 01:55:40,980
but how much does this represent the

2572
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:43,590
fears of the next generation to half of

2573
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,790
Africa who don't who are under 25 we

2574
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:46,740
don't see what's coming down the track

2575
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:49,050
the million a month in India who can't

2576
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:50,910
get a job it depends on where you have

2577
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:52,190
to remember where people are coming from

2578
01:55:50,910 --> 01:55:55,170
if you look at the relative

2579
01:55:52,190 --> 01:55:57,750
circumstances of even people who are in

2580
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:59,610
their 30s today in most of the world's

2581
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:01,200
geographies Asia and so they can

2582
01:55:59,610 --> 01:56:03,509
remember when their own lives were much

2583
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:04,769
worse let alone the quantum leap in the

2584
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:07,830
improvement in the standard of living

2585
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:10,350
that everyone who is above the age of 50

2586
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:12,390
can remember it across the entire

2587
01:56:10,350 --> 01:56:14,790
post-colonial world which is most of the

2588
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:17,580
planet Earth and so people even in

2589
01:56:14,790 --> 01:56:19,170
kind of difficult period you know have

2590
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:20,460
in mostly will have an appreciation of

2591
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:22,470
it they don't see themselves going

2592
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:24,600
backwards now in the opening remarks we

2593
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:27,810
heard a number of ministers talk about

2594
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:30,570
the the the relative decline in the

2595
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:32,490
quality of life or or or wages and

2596
01:56:30,570 --> 01:56:34,920
incomes and stagnation but that's

2597
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:36,300
applied to a certain few countries and

2598
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:37,740
you're all familiar with the elephant

2599
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:40,860
curve that shows you how it's that

2600
01:56:37,740 --> 01:56:43,800
particular desu isle of the population

2601
01:56:40,860 --> 01:56:45,089
of the lower middle-income stratum in in

2602
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:46,530
Western countries in particular

2603
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:48,660
particulars Western Europe the United

2604
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:51,000
States in the last decade and a half

2605
01:56:48,660 --> 01:56:52,290
that has gained relatively less than the

2606
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,210
rest of the world is gained but it's not

2607
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:56,610
to say that they're actually worse off

2608
01:56:54,210 --> 01:56:58,290
in in material terms than they were so

2609
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:59,940
we have to put this in context we I I

2610
01:56:58,290 --> 01:57:02,700
cannot be part of a conversation where

2611
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:04,259
we say that everyone is worse off all of

2612
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:05,700
a sudden and you actually pretend that

2613
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:07,650
you're talking about anything more than

2614
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:09,269
ten governments in the population so

2615
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:13,349
this is to Steve's point earlier about

2616
01:57:09,270 --> 01:57:15,240
or you identify 2016 this is 2017 and

2617
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:18,420
it's actually a tip this is the tail end

2618
01:57:15,240 --> 01:57:20,190
of a ten year period when the global

2619
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:22,500
conversation on what constitutes good

2620
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:23,610
and effective governance began to change

2621
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:26,460
because it begins of course with the

2622
01:57:23,610 --> 01:57:28,139
financial crisis and then came obviously

2623
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:30,570
Occupy Wall Street and all of the

2624
01:57:28,140 --> 01:57:33,090
movements around that the Arab Spring

2625
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:35,639
brexit and Trump so this is a ten year

2626
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:36,870
period not just the last year but but

2627
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:39,480
Steve is absolutely right to say that

2628
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:42,210
one of the key responses to the last ten

2629
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:44,480
years should be a lot more focus on

2630
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:46,410
political accountability and a lot more

2631
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:48,389
responsiveness of government to the

2632
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:50,370
demands of their population which is of

2633
01:57:48,390 --> 01:57:52,170
course the future voters which is of

2634
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:54,720
course the young people because many of

2635
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:56,460
the elder generation that just had their

2636
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:58,260
voice heard in brexit and elsewhere it

2637
01:57:56,460 --> 01:58:00,330
was their last stand if you will it was

2638
01:57:58,260 --> 01:58:01,920
their last 10 voting for Trump and their

2639
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:04,440
last stand with brexit what about the

2640
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:05,880
future and I think the the second pillar

2641
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:07,500
that I would add because I agree with

2642
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:09,840
everything that Steve said but an equal

2643
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:12,090
and important part of good governance is

2644
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,650
having a future plan and he didn't quite

2645
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:15,000
mention that and of course at the

2646
01:58:13,650 --> 01:58:16,799
Kennedy School they're training in your

2647
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,960
next generation leaders and teaching you

2648
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:20,550
what - what literature's to be in

2649
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:22,020
command of but just let me just

2650
01:58:20,550 --> 01:58:23,460
complement that with what happens at the

2651
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:25,710
Lee Kuan Yew School which was built and

2652
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:28,500
modeled on the Kennedy School a hundred

2653
01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:30,930
percent but what we do is bring

2654
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:33,300
in every day of the week every week of

2655
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:35,670
the year entire delegations of Indians

2656
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:38,220
of Chinese of Emiratis of Cossacks of

2657
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:40,260
Russians from the entire 5 billion

2658
01:58:38,220 --> 01:58:41,550
person catchment area that I was

2659
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:43,530
mentioning that I showed you on the map

2660
01:58:41,550 --> 01:58:45,660
we bring in hundreds of them all the

2661
01:58:43,530 --> 01:58:47,130
time and we don't just talk about you

2662
01:58:45,660 --> 01:58:49,260
know how do you make your regime more

2663
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:51,270
accountable they you generally know that

2664
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:53,190
they're suffering in that regard that

2665
01:58:51,270 --> 01:58:54,900
their weaknesses but what we train them

2666
01:58:53,190 --> 01:58:56,790
in is what is your plan for the future

2667
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:59,370
in light of technological disruptions a

2668
01:58:56,790 --> 01:59:01,710
more demanding population geopolitical

2669
01:58:59,370 --> 01:59:03,000
volatility demographic shifts of growing

2670
01:59:01,710 --> 01:59:05,190
entitlement obligations

2671
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,560
what is your country's plan and what we

2672
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:10,110
need to see a lot more of even in

2673
01:59:07,560 --> 01:59:12,360
wealthy established democracies that

2674
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:13,889
have had such a good run for the last

2675
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:15,990
several generations if they want to

2676
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:17,580
maintain that they too have to learn how

2677
01:59:15,990 --> 01:59:19,410
to make a plan for the future because

2678
01:59:17,580 --> 01:59:19,769
success is not guaranteed for anyone

2679
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:22,349
anymore

2680
01:59:19,770 --> 01:59:23,700
alrighty Stefan and and Yakko but I want

2681
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:25,320
to go to other people as well or should

2682
01:59:23,700 --> 01:59:28,160
I go to them be short it will be short

2683
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:32,580
ok ah in in a nutshell

2684
01:59:28,160 --> 01:59:36,860
to say what I the way I react what price

2685
01:59:32,580 --> 01:59:39,269
I would say that globalization plus the

2686
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:40,830
technological changes Automation and

2687
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:45,150
it's two different phenomena that

2688
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:49,380
together I've been fantastic to decrease

2689
01:59:45,150 --> 01:59:52,049
extreme poverty in the world in 1970 for

2690
01:59:49,380 --> 01:59:54,300
human beings out of 10 we're in extreme

2691
01:59:52,050 --> 01:59:57,690
poverty today is about two out of ten

2692
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:59,790
and it's decreasing very rapidly but not

2693
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:02,429
so good to decrease in the qualities

2694
01:59:59,790 --> 02:00:05,580
within society and especially within

2695
02:00:02,430 --> 02:00:07,440
develop societies and there we need to

2696
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:11,220
make the right choices and it's what I

2697
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:13,860
was suggesting for example to not oppose

2698
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:15,390
the market and the government and find a

2699
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:17,940
way for the government to strengthen the

2700
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:20,250
market for everyone otherwise you will

2701
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:21,929
have a growth that will benefit from the

2702
02:00:20,250 --> 02:00:23,940
elite when that for the ninety or ninety

2703
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:26,370
nine percent and then they will be

2704
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:29,309
vulnerable to populist arguments an

2705
02:00:26,370 --> 02:00:32,190
individual or a party that will say I am

2706
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:34,170
you I am the people elect me I will

2707
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:37,950
toast these elites with with their

2708
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:40,320
institutions their court system and so

2709
02:00:37,950 --> 02:00:42,269
on their universities their science and

2710
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:43,500
I will govern for you

2711
02:00:42,270 --> 02:00:45,330
let me check I mean you can give us a

2712
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:47,370
reality check you sat around the cabinet

2713
02:00:45,330 --> 02:00:49,920
table in Ottawa how much of what we're

2714
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:52,349
talking about today the long-term

2715
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:54,840
however long is how much is do you have

2716
02:00:52,350 --> 02:00:57,660
time to even consider these massive

2717
02:00:54,840 --> 02:00:59,610
strategic trends given the absolute

2718
02:00:57,660 --> 02:01:01,920
imperative for immediate political

2719
02:00:59,610 --> 02:01:05,009
management I have that always in line

2720
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:07,650
always endeavor decisions we're making

2721
02:01:05,010 --> 02:01:09,720
at the government this trend may be

2722
02:01:07,650 --> 02:01:11,910
contaminated Canada at any time no

2723
02:01:09,720 --> 02:01:14,790
country is immune you if you just

2724
02:01:11,910 --> 02:01:17,730
dislocate the cohesion of your country

2725
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:19,290
regarding diversity regarding the

2726
02:01:17,730 --> 02:01:22,200
ability to of institutions in which

2727
02:01:19,290 --> 02:01:24,450
people feel that they are part of it

2728
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:25,980
will not have always a top-down policy

2729
02:01:24,450 --> 02:01:27,450
but you announcing that vents what you

2730
02:01:25,980 --> 02:01:29,969
intend to do and to try to have the

2731
02:01:27,450 --> 02:01:32,760
support of the people a populist wave

2732
02:01:29,970 --> 02:01:35,220
make up in Canada very easily all right

2733
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:37,710
yeah and you will have democracy still

2734
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:39,930
but more in liberal democracies than

2735
02:01:37,710 --> 02:01:41,250
democracies with the rule of law okay

2736
02:01:39,930 --> 02:01:41,970
who's got to microphone at the back

2737
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:45,210
please

2738
02:01:41,970 --> 02:01:47,040
you please sit back yeah thank you very

2739
02:01:45,210 --> 02:01:51,990
much my name is Daniel Berta from CID

2740
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:53,580
Budapest and you just came up slightly

2741
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:54,809
with the question but but you also had a

2742
02:01:53,580 --> 02:01:57,059
question before depend on what is

2743
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:59,720
missing from the program what is missing

2744
02:01:57,060 --> 02:02:02,280
and what is missing extremely is Africa

2745
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:04,050
Africa is totally not there I think we

2746
02:02:02,280 --> 02:02:05,969
have one speaker that we have we have

2747
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:08,550
talked about Africa yep we can talk

2748
02:02:05,970 --> 02:02:10,530
about everything in detail not in not in

2749
02:02:08,550 --> 02:02:12,150
details but but the question from a

2750
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:14,910
European perspective because ten years

2751
02:02:12,150 --> 02:02:16,440
ago in all strategies suggested that the

2752
02:02:14,910 --> 02:02:18,540
key continent where we can make a

2753
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:21,089
difference is Europe it's going to be

2754
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:22,980
Africa and it seems that we are losing

2755
02:02:21,090 --> 02:02:25,770
the capability to initiate major

2756
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:27,719
policies at least in Africa furthermore

2757
02:02:25,770 --> 02:02:29,580
now more and more in European policies

2758
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:33,810
we are referring Africa as a threat

2759
02:02:29,580 --> 02:02:36,150
threat of migration threat as a stronger

2760
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:38,220
economic power in Europe as well in

2761
02:02:36,150 --> 02:02:41,280
medicine so how do you see the role of

2762
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:43,170
Africa in global dialogues and we visit

2763
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:44,450
in European dialogue thank you very much

2764
02:02:43,170 --> 02:02:46,830
indeed

2765
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:48,300
Melanie chime from here until recently

2766
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:49,950
the globe sec now with German Council on

2767
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:52,230
Foreign Relations the GAAP and let me

2768
02:02:49,950 --> 02:02:54,840
try to bring this discussion to here to

2769
02:02:52,230 --> 02:02:55,589
this region I mean elaborating on Nick

2770
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:58,440
on your

2771
02:02:55,590 --> 02:03:00,570
challenges for leadership and governance

2772
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:03,330
and Minister Dion you mentioned model of

2773
02:03:00,570 --> 02:03:05,759
Canada which might not work here some of

2774
02:03:03,330 --> 02:03:08,670
it element mine but others would not

2775
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:10,860
what would be your one advice or one

2776
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:13,739
challenge to these countries that you

2777
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:16,619
would highlight and let me acknowledge

2778
02:03:13,739 --> 02:03:20,309
that this in this region of 65 million

2779
02:03:16,619 --> 02:03:22,469
people crops xre a vision grad group

2780
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:24,480
represents four countries and four

2781
02:03:22,469 --> 02:03:27,480
different reactions to some of the

2782
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:29,309
challenges that you have mentioned some

2783
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:33,000
countries and in eurozone some are not

2784
02:03:29,310 --> 02:03:35,699
some are in the margins of the you in

2785
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:37,679
quarrel over values building special

2786
02:03:35,699 --> 02:03:40,230
relationship with Russia or China some

2787
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:42,690
are not so what would be your advice to

2788
02:03:40,230 --> 02:03:44,159
leaders of this region what I didn't

2789
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:46,919
just throw that up for the moment please

2790
02:03:44,159 --> 02:03:51,150
hear anyone else quickly the lady here

2791
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:53,429
in the front please w/kg London School

2792
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:56,219
of Economics LSE ideas I like to briefly

2793
02:03:53,429 --> 02:03:58,920
defend all people actually if I if I may

2794
02:03:56,219 --> 02:04:00,540
because the I have to certain for the

2795
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:02,580
share the panel's optimism about youth

2796
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:04,980
people not voting or for populist

2797
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:07,199
parties maybe it's coming for my old age

2798
02:04:04,980 --> 02:04:09,419
is pessimism but to give you an example

2799
02:04:07,199 --> 02:04:12,388
yeah it's ironic to give you one example

2800
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:15,000
about the French election first first

2801
02:04:12,389 --> 02:04:17,670
figure the two categories that voted

2802
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:21,540
more massively for Mac home are the 60

2803
02:04:17,670 --> 02:04:24,869
68 and 70 plus and in the first round

2804
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:26,869
you had 51% of the 1824 voted either

2805
02:04:24,869 --> 02:04:30,389
from a leaner pen or for far-left

2806
02:04:26,869 --> 02:04:32,190
populist Milan so my hint is that it has

2807
02:04:30,389 --> 02:04:34,349
to do actually about how technology

2808
02:04:32,190 --> 02:04:36,269
impacts politics and I like to get the

2809
02:04:34,349 --> 02:04:38,580
panel's view precisely on this point how

2810
02:04:36,270 --> 02:04:40,139
technology impact the wave relates to

2811
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:41,699
politics especially among the younger

2812
02:04:40,139 --> 02:04:45,599
generation a particular data mining and

2813
02:04:41,699 --> 02:04:48,360
things like that please and sound get me

2814
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:51,810
from UAE and heading a think-tank

2815
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:55,320
Emirates Policy Center my question what

2816
02:04:51,810 --> 02:04:57,060
is the future of globalization taking in

2817
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:00,330
concentration now

2818
02:04:57,060 --> 02:05:05,070
United State who's the head of

2819
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:08,190
globalization after tram is calling for

2820
02:05:05,070 --> 02:05:14,219
isolation and also the bridges

2821
02:05:08,190 --> 02:05:18,150
on the other side China is now moving

2822
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:21,390
for and encouraging the globalization so

2823
02:05:18,150 --> 02:05:23,639
this is my question what is the future

2824
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:24,840
of globalization all right let me ask

2825
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:27,150
each of you to pick up whatever you want

2826
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:29,610
yeah go but what's your view given your

2827
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:33,450
three principles about the way this is

2828
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:35,610
now beginning to stake out mm-hmm I want

2829
02:05:33,450 --> 02:05:39,540
to to address this issue of Central

2830
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:41,460
Europe because Bratislava Slovakia visa

2831
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:44,160
grat for central Eastern Europe is

2832
02:05:41,460 --> 02:05:46,230
increasingly part of a global chain

2833
02:05:44,160 --> 02:05:49,800
global economy but I think that

2834
02:05:46,230 --> 02:05:52,799
mentality is still falling behind which

2835
02:05:49,800 --> 02:05:55,680
means that these countries have made the

2836
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:58,710
choice geopolitical choice and 20 years

2837
02:05:55,680 --> 02:06:01,950
ago to be part of the EU NATO but but

2838
02:05:58,710 --> 02:06:05,610
still these days with self-doubt coming

2839
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:09,929
into the heart of Western civilization

2840
02:06:05,610 --> 02:06:12,809
European project and it's kind of easy

2841
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:15,480
to be tempted for other forms of

2842
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:18,060
cooperation be it 16 plus one china

2843
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:22,740
likes to rule and divide tries to pick

2844
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:25,590
up countries from the region and develop

2845
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:27,840
cooperation through their own rules by

2846
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:30,930
setting their own rules and I don't buy

2847
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:33,060
the optimistic talk of presidents who by

2848
02:06:30,930 --> 02:06:35,610
definition by their profession have to

2849
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:39,510
be optimistic and talk about a NATO

2850
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:42,599
summit as being very successful etc and

2851
02:06:39,510 --> 02:06:45,560
just look at us how we study body

2852
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:48,810
language of people how they behaved

2853
02:06:45,560 --> 02:06:52,890
during the NATO summit it means that we

2854
02:06:48,810 --> 02:06:55,740
are all terrified how will the leader of

2855
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:59,730
a free world's gonna behave will he will

2856
02:06:55,740 --> 02:07:01,889
he throw the table out and reject all

2857
02:06:59,730 --> 02:07:04,349
the rules or will he support everything

2858
02:07:01,890 --> 02:07:06,660
that we have built after the second

2859
02:07:04,350 --> 02:07:10,290
world a world war the point I'm making

2860
02:07:06,660 --> 02:07:12,660
is that we are extremely sensitive an

2861
02:07:10,290 --> 02:07:13,920
extremely sensitive moment and Central

2862
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:16,889
Europe is particularly vulnerable

2863
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:20,899
because this layer of institutions the

2864
02:07:16,890 --> 02:07:22,849
free market economy is just 20 years old

2865
02:07:20,899 --> 02:07:25,760
we have conducted the public opinion

2866
02:07:22,849 --> 02:07:28,189
polls here and here in the Slovakia in

2867
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:30,590
Bratislava but going also beyond to

2868
02:07:28,189 --> 02:07:31,999
other countries of the region and we see

2869
02:07:30,590 --> 02:07:34,669
that young people especially young

2870
02:07:31,999 --> 02:07:37,219
people they are confused they are afraid

2871
02:07:34,669 --> 02:07:39,439
they follow social media but they don't

2872
02:07:37,219 --> 02:07:41,389
know what a really true for is and when

2873
02:07:39,439 --> 02:07:43,280
you say the political class is in touch

2874
02:07:41,389 --> 02:07:44,719
with that reality no I don't think they

2875
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:46,669
are how much is there a shock there

2876
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:48,709
which we just heard from Stefan yeah

2877
02:07:46,669 --> 02:07:50,570
well I what he worries about a head

2878
02:07:48,709 --> 02:07:52,249
worried about as a minister sitting at

2879
02:07:50,570 --> 02:07:53,570
the table wondering about something

2880
02:07:52,249 --> 02:07:55,610
which is going to hit the Canadian

2881
02:07:53,570 --> 02:07:57,499
government at high speed they didn't see

2882
02:07:55,610 --> 02:07:59,659
it coming mhm well I think that there is

2883
02:07:57,499 --> 02:08:02,179
a growing divide between what young

2884
02:07:59,659 --> 02:08:04,669
people think about and what politicians

2885
02:08:02,179 --> 02:08:07,669
have to offer to them there were

2886
02:08:04,669 --> 02:08:10,269
recently a protest that in Poland about

2887
02:08:07,669 --> 02:08:13,099
ACTA about legislation concerning

2888
02:08:10,269 --> 02:08:15,199
property rights and you can see that

2889
02:08:13,099 --> 02:08:17,599
politicians are living an absolutely

2890
02:08:15,199 --> 02:08:18,909
different world stratosphere from from

2891
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:21,949
young people

2892
02:08:18,909 --> 02:08:24,018
Steve how much is this a really profound

2893
02:08:21,949 --> 02:08:25,969
problem but also let me throw in for the

2894
02:08:24,019 --> 02:08:29,090
last three of you quickly when Steve

2895
02:08:25,969 --> 02:08:31,189
Bannon says I our administration is up

2896
02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:33,559
for the deconstruction of the

2897
02:08:31,189 --> 02:08:35,209
administrative State is that something

2898
02:08:33,559 --> 02:08:37,010
which large numbers of other governments

2899
02:08:35,209 --> 02:08:41,599
around the world a wondering of they're

2900
02:08:37,010 --> 02:08:43,519
going to embark upon I I find that

2901
02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:46,369
argument actually hit bannon's argument

2902
02:08:43,519 --> 02:08:47,689
completely baffling because one of the

2903
02:08:46,369 --> 02:08:50,780
things that's I think powerfully

2904
02:08:47,689 --> 02:08:53,360
associated with a global successful

2905
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:55,429
globalization and successful societies

2906
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:57,589
are in fact effective administrative

2907
02:08:55,429 --> 02:08:59,570
states the more exposed you are to

2908
02:08:57,590 --> 02:09:01,639
international trade as my colleague

2909
02:08:59,570 --> 02:09:03,709
Danny Roderick is shown the more you

2910
02:09:01,639 --> 02:09:05,449
need an effective government to manage

2911
02:09:03,709 --> 02:09:07,309
those trading relationships and to

2912
02:09:05,449 --> 02:09:09,589
manage the social and economic

2913
02:09:07,309 --> 02:09:11,389
consequences at home so the idea that

2914
02:09:09,590 --> 02:09:13,129
you can be engaged with the rest of the

2915
02:09:11,389 --> 02:09:15,679
world and slowly let your government

2916
02:09:13,129 --> 02:09:17,959
fall apart is complete nonsense it's got

2917
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:19,789
a 32% reduction in the State Department

2918
02:09:17,959 --> 02:09:21,289
budget is not exactly an investment no

2919
02:09:19,789 --> 02:09:23,409
absolutely not in completely

2920
02:09:21,289 --> 02:09:25,249
short-sighted I could give you a long

2921
02:09:23,409 --> 02:09:27,308
disposition well if that will spare

2922
02:09:25,249 --> 02:09:29,929
people but that's absolutely

2923
02:09:27,309 --> 02:09:31,969
counterproductive from an American point

2924
02:09:29,929 --> 02:09:34,760
of view my central point here is though

2925
02:09:31,969 --> 02:09:37,309
that no society I know of has

2926
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:38,900
were improved itself by cutting itself

2927
02:09:37,309 --> 02:09:40,730
off from the rest of the world in terms

2928
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:43,429
of Education in terms of people in terms

2929
02:09:40,730 --> 02:09:45,589
of trade in terms of investment it's

2930
02:09:43,429 --> 02:09:49,039
never been a long-term strategy for

2931
02:09:45,590 --> 02:09:51,469
success the only appropriate strategies

2932
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:53,300
and you even see authoritarian

2933
02:09:51,469 --> 02:09:55,670
governments of course being forced to do

2934
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:57,469
this is engagement with the world in a

2935
02:09:55,670 --> 02:10:00,289
variety of ways and the development of

2936
02:09:57,469 --> 02:10:02,150
government competence which means not

2937
02:10:00,289 --> 02:10:04,489
running down government's or trying to

2938
02:10:02,150 --> 02:10:06,710
take them apart but rather getting the

2939
02:10:04,489 --> 02:10:10,909
very best people to welcome government

2940
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:12,739
service I worry greatly about whether or

2941
02:10:10,909 --> 02:10:14,839
not the sort of Trump example will be

2942
02:10:12,739 --> 02:10:17,468
contagious in other places

2943
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:19,400
I think they the quote-unquote

2944
02:10:17,469 --> 02:10:21,289
marginally good news is that that

2945
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:23,360
experiment is like that it goes so badly

2946
02:10:21,289 --> 02:10:26,119
that most other countries will not want

2947
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:29,869
to imitate our experience Stefan

2948
02:10:26,119 --> 02:10:32,839
well populism is wrong protectionism is

2949
02:10:29,869 --> 02:10:35,630
not the right way to go racism is wrong

2950
02:10:32,840 --> 02:10:38,210
but in order to avoid all that we need

2951
02:10:35,630 --> 02:10:40,940
to look at the problems we have the

2952
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:43,340
youth of France and Spain and Italy and

2953
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:46,489
many countries between 25 and 50 percent

2954
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:48,500
of unemployment what do you do with that

2955
02:10:46,489 --> 02:10:50,299
because if you do nothing of course they

2956
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:53,030
will think the institution's are against

2957
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:55,519
them and they need to have a strong man

2958
02:10:53,030 --> 02:10:58,579
or woman that will speak for them and

2959
02:10:55,519 --> 02:11:00,980
toast these old institutions and people

2960
02:10:58,579 --> 02:11:03,500
so in order to it in order to avoid that

2961
02:11:00,980 --> 02:11:05,750
you need to have a good strategy indeed

2962
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:08,000
and I think the government in which I am

2963
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:10,159
as a good strategy but we are ready to

2964
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,780
debate it in order to debate it you need

2965
02:11:10,159 --> 02:11:13,369
to have strong institutions strong

2966
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:15,980
Parliament strong parties of the

2967
02:11:13,369 --> 02:11:18,768
positions strong press and dependent

2968
02:11:15,980 --> 02:11:21,289
judiciary don't dislocate these

2969
02:11:18,769 --> 02:11:24,170
institutions otherwise you will damage

2970
02:11:21,289 --> 02:11:26,090
your countries and you will damage the

2971
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:29,750
capital countries to be competitive in

2972
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:31,579
the world finally paradigm in your your

2973
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:33,769
your work is about connector graffia and

2974
02:11:31,579 --> 02:11:35,480
picking up the lady from the UAE from

2975
02:11:33,769 --> 02:11:38,599
the Institute there about globalization

2976
02:11:35,480 --> 02:11:41,150
can you imagine that some of those maps

2977
02:11:38,599 --> 02:11:42,619
with those long arrows going from China

2978
02:11:41,150 --> 02:11:46,339
that some of those are going to become

2979
02:11:42,619 --> 02:11:48,818
cut up or perforated in the coming

2980
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:51,159
period or not is globalization

2981
02:11:48,819 --> 02:11:55,059
tabouli broadly here to stay or are

2982
02:11:51,159 --> 02:11:59,339
there real pushback instincts and forces

2983
02:11:55,059 --> 02:12:01,959
at work which could could lead to this

2984
02:11:59,339 --> 02:12:04,359
reflection of populism which means there

2985
02:12:01,959 --> 02:12:06,068
is less globalization there's there's

2986
02:12:04,359 --> 02:12:07,510
never going to be less globalization

2987
02:12:06,069 --> 02:12:09,219
it's you would only think that

2988
02:12:07,510 --> 02:12:10,629
globalization is reversing if you don't

2989
02:12:09,219 --> 02:12:12,459
know what globalization is quite frankly

2990
02:12:10,629 --> 02:12:15,280
if you think of globalization only in

2991
02:12:12,459 --> 02:12:17,589
terms of the volume of containers that

2992
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:18,579
are on Maersk ships going from port to

2993
02:12:17,589 --> 02:12:20,709
port if that's your understanding

2994
02:12:18,579 --> 02:12:21,938
globalization then you could make a case

2995
02:12:20,709 --> 02:12:24,459
that there's going to be some reduction

2996
02:12:21,939 --> 02:12:26,619
but the fastest-growing category of

2997
02:12:24,459 --> 02:12:28,389
trade if in case you only want to talk

2998
02:12:26,619 --> 02:12:30,459
about trade is in any case digital

2999
02:12:28,389 --> 02:12:32,319
services and services don't require that

3000
02:12:30,459 --> 02:12:34,059
kind of infrastructure there's a reason

3001
02:12:32,319 --> 02:12:35,619
why the technology companies and

3002
02:12:34,059 --> 02:12:37,629
telecoms of the world are investing

3003
02:12:35,619 --> 02:12:39,459
billions of dollars in more high-speed

3004
02:12:37,629 --> 02:12:42,459
fiber-optic cables because that is how

3005
02:12:39,459 --> 02:12:44,919
money is made today is by trading those

3006
02:12:42,459 --> 02:12:47,229
bits rather than atoms all over the

3007
02:12:44,919 --> 02:12:48,999
world so I don't worry at all about the

3008
02:12:47,229 --> 02:12:50,349
future of globalisation I think it's

3009
02:12:48,999 --> 02:12:52,179
much more interesting for us talk about

3010
02:12:50,349 --> 02:12:54,280
what categories of globalization are

3011
02:12:52,179 --> 02:12:55,809
going to be even more robust at even

3012
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:57,398
faster rates than they are right now

3013
02:12:55,809 --> 02:12:59,379
that is the correct way to understand if

3014
02:12:57,399 --> 02:13:00,669
you really if you really break it up in

3015
02:12:59,379 --> 02:13:02,530
these different categories they're real

3016
02:13:00,669 --> 02:13:03,879
and one of the most important reasons is

3017
02:13:02,530 --> 02:13:05,530
really a geopolitical one because

3018
02:13:03,879 --> 02:13:08,079
globalisation is not some neutral

3019
02:13:05,530 --> 02:13:09,879
phenomenon that just simply magically

3020
02:13:08,079 --> 02:13:12,159
manifests itself it's always been an

3021
02:13:09,879 --> 02:13:13,869
imperial enterprise globalization is

3022
02:13:12,159 --> 02:13:15,249
what happens when America wants to push

3023
02:13:13,869 --> 02:13:16,629
outward when Europe wants to push

3024
02:13:15,249 --> 02:13:19,389
outward and when China wants to push

3025
02:13:16,629 --> 02:13:21,159
outward all at the same time you get the

3026
02:13:19,389 --> 02:13:22,869
volume of globalization that we have

3027
02:13:21,159 --> 02:13:24,608
today which is incredibly significant

3028
02:13:22,869 --> 02:13:26,889
greater than any other time in history

3029
02:13:24,609 --> 02:13:28,479
and so the more powers that you have in

3030
02:13:26,889 --> 02:13:30,339
the system that want to expand their

3031
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:32,289
influence by definition the more

3032
02:13:30,339 --> 02:13:34,539
globalization you're going to have the

3033
02:13:32,289 --> 02:13:36,579
question is as these spiders compete in

3034
02:13:34,539 --> 02:13:38,889
the web who's getting the upper hand

3035
02:13:36,579 --> 02:13:40,688
over whom not not how much globalization

3036
02:13:38,889 --> 02:13:43,089
you have so it's the wrong question that

3037
02:13:40,689 --> 02:13:46,479
many people are asking more importantly

3038
02:13:43,089 --> 02:13:49,479
about the administrative state and you

3039
02:13:46,479 --> 02:13:50,619
know Steve Benin he almost came late to

3040
02:13:49,479 --> 02:13:52,359
the party America has been

3041
02:13:50,619 --> 02:13:54,429
deconstructing the administrative state

3042
02:13:52,359 --> 02:13:56,709
from the entire period between Reagan

3043
02:13:54,429 --> 02:13:59,709
and Newt Gingrich if you're not if you

3044
02:13:56,709 --> 02:14:01,239
recall 24 years ago there was this thing

3045
02:13:59,709 --> 02:14:02,769
called the contract with America in

3046
02:14:01,239 --> 02:14:04,809
which Newt Gingrich's speak

3047
02:14:02,770 --> 02:14:07,330
of the house more or less with the final

3048
02:14:04,810 --> 02:14:10,030
nail on the coffin in having the kind of

3049
02:14:07,330 --> 02:14:11,860
sort of high quality civil service and

3050
02:14:10,030 --> 02:14:14,410
Federal service and it's been degrading

3051
02:14:11,860 --> 02:14:16,540
and degenerating from way more than a

3052
02:14:14,410 --> 02:14:18,400
generation now and so if you want to

3053
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:20,950
Steve is absolutely right both in theory

3054
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:22,629
and in practice if you want to be a

3055
02:14:20,950 --> 02:14:24,250
successful state you have to be a

3056
02:14:22,630 --> 02:14:25,870
globalized state and you have to have a

3057
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:27,970
very good administer very strong

3058
02:14:25,870 --> 02:14:30,400
administrative capacity that's something

3059
02:14:27,970 --> 02:14:33,610
America completely lacks today and needs

3060
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:33,790
to rebuild from scratch all right thank

3061
02:14:33,610 --> 02:14:35,830
you

3062
02:14:33,790 --> 02:14:37,300
Perik Yakka by Stephan and Steve thanks

3063
02:14:35,830 --> 02:14:39,309
very much indeed for me the headline is

3064
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:43,810
Steve saying old people shouldn't vote

3065
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:47,620
but so whoever's tweeted that you've got

3066
02:14:43,810 --> 02:14:49,600
a story there I didn't say that if they

3067
02:14:47,620 --> 02:14:51,580
didn't if they didn't vote outcomes

3068
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:54,040
would be very different you know what

3069
02:14:51,580 --> 02:14:55,330
happens on Twitter I do indeed can I

3070
02:14:54,040 --> 02:14:56,830
thank you all very much indeed we've

3071
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:58,630
tried to identify global trends I

3072
02:14:56,830 --> 02:15:00,370
apologize if you're frustrated that we

3073
02:14:58,630 --> 02:15:02,200
weren't dynamic and imaginative enough

3074
02:15:00,370 --> 02:15:03,970
but you've come up with good ideas more

3075
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:06,220
to come in the next two days service

3076
02:15:03,970 --> 02:15:08,440
