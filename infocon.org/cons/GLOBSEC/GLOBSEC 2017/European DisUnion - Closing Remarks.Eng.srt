to prime ministers and a president on

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:09,629
this stage for you with really the most

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:12,149
important subject that faces Europe

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,580
today the future of Europe European

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,730
disunion with a question mark at the end

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,880
of that I would like to introduce our

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,150
esteemed panelists beginning with Prime

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,119
Minister feet so our host here the prime

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,009
minister of Slovakia as you know we have

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,329
Prime Minister Sobotka

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:36,120
as well from the Czech Republic and on

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,210
the far right just in the seating order

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,839
not politically speaking we have Donald

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:49,050
Tusk the president of the European

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:52,199
Council anyone who has read a newspaper

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:54,870
over the past few years couldn't avoid

17
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,930
the conclusion that Europe might be on

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,589
the brink of collapse or very close to

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,930
it a book that was recently published in

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,220
the u.s. even carried the title the the

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,430
end of Europe and yet Europe has somehow

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,830
persevered through all of these myriad

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:17,220
crises in recent months we've seen

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,650
populist defeated in Austria in the

25
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,670
Netherlands and most importantly in

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:27,299
France so the real question now is has

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,939
Europe turned the corner and I think we

28
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,290
would all like to ask our panelists that

29
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,809
question and I will start with a few

30
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,030
questions and then invite you the

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,860
audience to come in so please think

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,189
about what you would like to ask I'd

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:45,180
also like to welcome our viewers on

34
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:48,419
Facebook live and on the other live

35
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,390
streams that are available today I would

36
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,689
however like to start with with

37
00:01:51,390 --> 00:02:00,439
president toast if I may who's just come

38
00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:03,500
back from the g7 meetings in Sicily and

39
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,669
president tools from your initial

40
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,479
comments over the past week after your

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,340
meetings with US President Trump you

42
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,150
seem to be

43
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,870
somewhat skeptical about the

44
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,180
relationship the transatlantic

45
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,550
relationship in the sense that it was

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,730
clear that there isn't complete

47
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,380
agreement in in the u.s. on a lot of

48
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,570
issues as we know there's the climate

49
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,250
issue and there are other issues so if I

50
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,829
could just start with you because the

51
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:35,070
importance of the transatlantic

52
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,410
relationship for Europe today and

53
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,239
historically with the u.s. being really

54
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:41,070
one of the drivers of European

55
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,050
integration over the past several

56
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,880
decades and I would just like to start

57
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,600
with you and get your oppressions of the

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,769
last couple of days and the state of

59
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:56,040
eu-us relations under President Trump

60
00:02:51,770 --> 00:03:00,930
thank you first of all I think it's a

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:05,730
maybe the best evidence I mean our

62
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:10,530
meeting in Taormina F 57 may be the best

63
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,780
evidence that there's rumors about the

64
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:17,760
decline of the West are it's likely an

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:21,900
exaggeration and this is why I infact I

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,530
can't accept this assumption in your

67
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:28,650
first question your thesis about the end

68
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,040
of the Western world or the U or Europe

69
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:35,459
it's a quite the opposite in my

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,459
impression after g7 meetings is a more

71
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:41,010
optimistic than then I expected

72
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,670
including our new partners around the

73
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:51,269
table I mean especially presidents Trump

74
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:57,540
of course it's I am NOT here to to be a

75
00:03:51,269 --> 00:04:01,120
part of this of this new culture of

76
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:06,190
permanent leaks and

77
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:10,360
if you know feel free feel free we're

78
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:13,300
all friends here sometimes from time to

79
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:18,160
time we need also some discreet format

80
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:19,810
and data tapes and but what I what I am

81
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:29,320
absolutely sure after this meeting is

82
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:32,290
that despite some extraordinary four

83
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:35,830
markets of expressions behaviors etc etc

84
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:39,370
our partners in g7 are much more

85
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,229
responsible then then maybe the first

86
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,830
impression after the election in the

87
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:50,380
United States it means that in almost

88
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:53,770
every topics we found a common position

89
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,320
and it was much easier process than than

90
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,359
I expected including our discussions

91
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,440
about climate I know that it was maybe

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,780
because in fact the lack of a final

93
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,510
positive decision of President Trump

94
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,539
about Paris agreement it's it was the

95
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:15,330
most spectacular moment because as you

96
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:19,990
know only the best news our newest here

97
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:23,080
but my impression is that after this

98
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,270
meeting our our cooperation and

99
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,090
including our transatlantic cooperation

100
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,340
between Europe and the United States can

101
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,489
be easier than we than we expected just

102
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:37,119
after the election divided since that is

103
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,169
a very optimistic tone just just a quick

104
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,120
follow-up do you think that the United

105
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:44,880
States will pull out of the Paris Accord

106
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,880
that is really the key question here

107
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,530
hello it

108
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:57,250
sometimes too optimistic politicians

109
00:05:53,530 --> 00:06:05,289
look look very naive and this is what I

110
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:09,070
want to avoid this but if for sure after

111
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:12,250
after our meeting with President Trump

112
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:16,210
in Brussels and especially after g7 I

113
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:22,330
think that that he is ready and he is

114
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:25,630
able and even determined to to change

115
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:30,430
this first and rather bad impression

116
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:34,600
after after his messages especially

117
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:36,450
during his campaign now privately and

118
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,700
publicly he sounds much more

119
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:46,419
pro-european and responsibly okay I

120
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:48,280
would like to go to Prime Minister so

121
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:49,270
now and and you would like to add

122
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,049
something I would just like to remind

123
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,820
the audience that you have translation

124
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,110
from Slovak and Czech into English

125
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,240
because the Prime Minister's will be

126
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:04,020
speaking in their native tongues Prime

127
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,020
Minister the floor is yours

128

Omashu dodging I believe and it's a

137
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:46,060
shame that we not do not discussed it in

138
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:47,469
big detail I think that when it comes to

139
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,870
the relations between the United States

140
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,900
and the European Union the politics

141
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:57,760
creates a huge chance for the European

142
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:02,700
Union I wouldn't be nervous at all if I

143
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,289
were to generalize based on the expert

144
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,659
statements of the US administration that

145
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:11,050
the Europe should be taken care more of

146
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:14,169
itself we are more than 500 million

147
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,969
people in the European Union and Donald

148
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:19,180
you remember that when we had the

149
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:21,460
Bratislava summit we clearly stated that

150
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,800
the European Union has to be a more

151
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:27,489
significant player though we cannot

152
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,979
always rely beyond what the US

153
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,450
administration will say or whether they

154
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:35,500
will agree with the Russian Federation

155
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:38,740
or China therefore I would really grasp

156
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,020
this chance more timely and perhaps we

157
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,539
should discuss at European Council

158
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,910
meetings are frequently how to be

159
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:47,949
committed in various regions well

160
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,540
unfortunately despite our economic

161
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,970
strength despite our numbers of

162
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,579
inhabitants we do not play the role we

163
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,209
could roll around the second floor and

164
00:08:54,579 --> 00:09:00,060
maybe this will lead to a discussion and

165
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:03,300
these meetings are about is nothing

166
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:06,550
whenever the US president was elected

167
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:09,349
dr. when Donald Trump was elected I was

168
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:13,310
asked that maybe I caught my attention

169
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:17,660
in his first statements that he made

170
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:20,060
after collation and I said that I was

171
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,270
particularly interested by his statement

172
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,900
and I'll be paraphrasing that as ago the

173
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:29,210
Democrats Yabuki export of democracy has

174
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,850
stopped as it was in the past

175
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,940
exporting democracy to certain countries

176
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:37,310
and let's be frank at this yeah get up

177
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,990
occasionally at the meetings of the

178
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,719
European Council some prime ministers

179
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,810
and presidents of course stated that in

180
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,600
the past we committed huge mistakes when

181
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,180
we thought like that just out of the

182
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,920
blue we could plant our ideas of

183
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,569
democracy human rights into other

184
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,910
countries there's a we're debris glands

185
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:59,300
let me give an example of Libya for

186
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:02,089
example Libya basically doesn't exist

187
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,430
today it's very easy to walk a regime

188
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,560
it's very easy to remove a dictator or

189
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:12,319
if a bomb but we didn't have a plan B

190
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:15,290
and the plan B was missing I would be

191
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,450
cautious and I would remind us to be

192
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,219
cautious in relation to Syria there we

193
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,430
could find a solution but do we have a

194
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:27,170
plan for this region region so on the

195
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:28,670
one hand we might be disturbed by some

196
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,079
statements from the other part of the

197
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,819
Atlantic but on the other hand I see

198
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,120
them as a great chance for the European

199
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,910
Union as a great transferable body to

200
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,860
complete change in the behavior of

201
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,900
global players such as the United States

202
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,720
Russian Federation and China so this is

203
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:46,880
what I wanted to add to this well as I

204
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,190
would say in fact that Europe also needs

205
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,870
a plan B for Europe because the current

206
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,790
structure isn't really working out the

207
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,820
way many had hoped I'd like to come to

208
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:59,360
you Prime Minister so vodka how do you

209
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,950
see the the current state of the

210
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,960
European Union there's a lot of

211
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,690
discussion at the moment about moving

212
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,420
more towards a multi-speed European

213
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,540
Union you come from a country that is

214
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,910
among the most Euroskeptic at least

215
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,110
according to the the latest globe sec

216
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:21,230
trends report which has just come out

217
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:23,000
where only 35 percent of Czechs said

218
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,070
they thought that the European Union

219
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,140
was a good thing what does that mean for

220
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:31,670
the future of the European Union sir

221
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,370
yeah the ketchup or Yakov odds are I

222
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:38,719
would also like to thank for the

223
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:44,810
invitation to wish you a beautiful

224
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:46,820
Sunday and perhaps I will also touch

225
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,680
upon the issue offer the new US

226
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,420
president the climate agreement from

227
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:55,910
Paris is an important thing but the

228
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:58,630
topic that has been that we've been

229
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:02,900
dealing with in Europe is the migration

230
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,700
wave caused by the war in Syria and I

231
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:07,360
assume that Donald Trump has the

232
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:10,370
opportunity as a new US president to

233
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,310
find ways how to promote political

234
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,670
agreement in Syria to stop the war to

235
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:19,489
end the war and perhaps allows at least

236
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:22,579
some of the people who fled the war to

237
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:25,100
go back to Syria and this is what we are

238
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:28,310
vitally interested in in Europe because

239
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,190
the migration mm pressure has been

240
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,469
stopped by the agreement with Turkey but

241
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,390
even the agreement with Turkey is under

242
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,790
pressure so maybe we should go back to

243
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:40,670
the key priorities that we have in the

244
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,589
security area and to my mind are

245
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,599
continuing a political dialogue in Syria

246
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,640
searching of looking for an agreement

247
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,520
that would end the war in Syria this is

248
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,740
something that we should expect of the

249
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,350
new US president within the role that

250
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:58,280
the United States play and within the

251
00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:01,250
dialogue that is planned with Russian

252
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,319
President Putin and if the situation in

253
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,350
Europe and the and about the situation

254
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,980
in Europe and the skeptic atmosphere in

255
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,770
the Czech Republic

256
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,170
it's a paradoxical situation because we

257
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,329
worked hard to become members of the

258
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:15,829
European Union we are prospering we have

259
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,760
the lowest unemployment rate in the

260
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:23,220
entire European Union we use the

261
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,750
accessible of the easy accessibility of

262
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,760
the European market so we were able to

263
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,410
use it in economic terms for our

264
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,530
economic growth for the modernization of

265
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,600
the country at the European funds helped

266
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:37,800
us significantly so it's a paradoxical

267
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,990
to see the skeptical attitude that

268
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,180
really is there

269
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:47,420
well we witnessed recently the eurozone

270
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:49,530
crisis and degrees which perhaps really

271
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,870
strengthened the skeptical view of the

272
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:56,069
common or single currency in neurotic

273
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:58,050
and then we saw the migration crisis and

274
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,060
I think that contributed to these

275
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,089
capital attitudes of our people way and

276
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:06,329
about the future of Europe we certainly

277
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,990
follow the discussion or the multi-speed

278
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:12,660
your garber but we do see some years

279
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:16,320
it's hailed as a country without the

280
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:19,560
euro as currency we would wish that

281
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,900
decisions regarding the future of Europe

282
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,469
would take place at the table where all

283
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,840
27 member states are represented we have

284
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,940
enhanced cooperation on the possibility

285
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,580
of in hands cooperation and certainly

286
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:35,280
that would be a natural platform for

287
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:38,670
closer education reform there but at the

288
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:41,189
same time we don't want to see new

289
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,180
barriers created within the European

290
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:48,710
between the eurozone and other countries

291
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,640
we would terrible okay then have it um

292
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,350
it would be more difficult for us to

293
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,939
move forward to these other integration

294
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,300
rules where do we specifically see the

295
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,810
disadvantages to your own country if we

296
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:03,439
were to move towards this dual track

297
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,280
Europe with a much more integrated

298
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,170
eurozone there's nothing stopping the

299
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,860
Czech Republic from joining the eurozone

300
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:12,569
for example so what really is the core

301
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,850
the core issue for you there's there's a

302
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,790
lot of discussion in Poland and other

303
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,650
countries about losing money from the

304
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,300
structural funds and and so forth

305
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,130
there's worry about that but from your

306
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:25,949
perspective where do you see really the

307
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,189
main disadvantage from a multi-speed

308
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,190
here

309
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,920
the Commission's yeah she said she has

310
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:41,099
any vegetable I think me out there or

311
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,040
before country so do not use hero

312
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,270
servant with Slovakia being down the

313
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,430
exception and I may only congratulate

314
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:53,280
Slovakia how they have managed but it is

315
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,839
quite obvious that even the Czech

316
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,199
Republic whether discussions will be

317
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,600
more offensive especially after the

318
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:04,830
French and German elections we made it

319
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,900
back up higher pressure from France and

320
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:10,080
Germany to come to great the eurozone

321
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:13,980
will do more and adoption of euro in the

322
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:18,930
countries where it is is not available

323
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:21,630
yet and however if we compare our living

324
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:24,300
standard with the Western countries and

325
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,000
the countries who are using the euro we

326
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,219
have an urge to enhance the situation on

327
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,470
the public budget but we are still

328
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,930
lagging behind as far as the wages are

329
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,840
concerned and I don't say we still need

330
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:40,500
some day time on the package able to

331
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:43,910
increase real wages and to reshape the

332
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,710
structure of our empty economy a little

333
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,900
should have in order to focus on over a

334
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,760
tech manufacturing and production with

335
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:55,020
higher and it values should we manage

336
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:58,670
this will have of it also a more

337
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:02,730
positive attitude towards the adoption

338
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:05,280
alleged that but I think him a bit

339
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,280
romantic trouble sentiment it is very

340
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,339
important how did euro

341
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,290
will cope with the Greek crisis and how

342
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,480
much eurozone even hospitals got a

343
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:18,780
moment and we will review country such

344
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,280
as black a Slovenia Baltic her countries

345
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,319
and what is their experience with

346
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,910
adopting heroes what is what is your

347
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,460
what is your view on that you've

348
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,930
obviously been in in the Euro for quite

349
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,960
some time some people would say more

350
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:33,390
precious should be put on countries like

351
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,670
the Czech Republic and Poland to begin

352
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,920
the process of joining the euro what is

353
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,960
your view as a country in Central Europe

354
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,570
that has been a member of the currency

355
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,809
Kalama a curriculum yacht for NATO

356
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:48,600
program yasuo seems awesome well a very

357
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:51,178
openly I not agree with you that is

358
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:56,100
mainly the European Union who needs Plan

359
00:17:51,179 --> 00:18:00,480
B I don't think Europe needs plan B what

360
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:04,049
Europe or needs is a good open - yeah

361
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,559
Europe the other respect sir not only

362
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:09,870
sow more respect towards its

363
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,629
international interest among its member

364
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,029
states that was I think that Rihanna

365
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:18,120
white

366
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:19,830

applause communica by positive methods

368
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:24,210
our problem in the European Union is the

369
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:26,640
inability to communicate the positive

370
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,279
things well when I am a meeting young

371

people in BH Drive women Africa region

372

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,289
explain them the importance of Schengen

374
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,659
if they do not understand me they more

375
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,120
considerate that's granted when I'm

376
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:42,750
explaining that I had to wait for three

377
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,539
hours

378
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,970
when I had my baggage checked any

379
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,890
control community for them it is

380
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,159
something unimaginable horror emailtosh

381
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,440
I miss Madiba emotional student when we

382
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,419
say that we did not have the opportunity

383
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,149
but is studying anywhere da-da-da-dah

384
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:03,299
good night just sit in the car find a

385
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:05,699
job in Germany Austria Spain or France a

386
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:08,309
pedagogy cavity currently McAra

387
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,100
cannot even sell any possible things

388
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:13,139
that we owe me currently one perhaps for

389
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,709
example the roaming you will you pay the

390
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,590
same price anywhere maybe did not use it

391
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,740
huge commended these are the real things

392
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,899
that we use for real people

393
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:27,690
this is also a problem of our own

394
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:30,418
ability to don't ask the positive

395
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,970
message as you know but it should be us

396
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,470
the national politicians who should

397
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,250
promote the European Union on the

398
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:40,830
national and as far as the two-speed or

399
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:46,710
multiple speaker Bureau is concerned

400
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:48,178
this is becoming a tragic comedy we are

401
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,960
speaking about the seconds we could

402
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,580
speed up

403
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,380
but this is quite normal we do have

404
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:58,039
countries that have Euro and those who

405
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:01,059
dot and my one of the Prime Minister's

406
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:06,200
of those countries have Europe and I

407
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:08,600
wish that every single decision that we

408
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,149
adopt in the eurozone would be done in

409
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,418
cooperation with the countries that do

410
00:20:11,149 --> 00:20:16,908
not have euros because it is up to them

411
00:20:14,419 --> 00:20:20,870
to decide when they enter eurozone on

412
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:23,929
the other hand I fully expect from those

413
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:27,320
countries who do not have you know euros

414
00:20:23,929 --> 00:20:30,049
to respective convergence of those

415
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,019
countries who do have a euro so I will

416
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:35,000
have today a phone call with the new

417
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:37,730
French president and I will ask him

418
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,120
about these things it seems that there

419
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:44,360
is a new French German integration

420
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,850
engine under construction and I agree

421
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:51,289
with them we cannot have one currency

422
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:55,789
when one country has a balanced budget

423
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:58,070
the other one has a deficit budget so

424
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:00,110
those countries who are not in the

425
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,480
eurozone and have significantly better

426
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,699
results than the countries of eurozone

427
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,120
for example Poland or Czech Republic

428
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:12,080
this countries could serve an example

429
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:15,830
should they be in the eurozone is our

430
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:19,460
official position do you know if there

431
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,789
is a new bitch integration engine of

432
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,230
closer convergence of the universal not

433
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:27,408
only we want to be part of a discussion

434
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:32,120
we want to be on the train we want to be

435
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:34,429
in the quality that does in the group

436
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,668
around the Euro will be more convergent

437
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:39,740
you want to be part of it however we may

438
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:43,129
not allow this topic to be divisive

439
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,679
before the European Union as a whole you

440
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:47,600
want to be part of it want to

441
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,600
participate on it but we may not allow

442
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,149
it to be divisive how do you avoid what

443
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,129
Prime Minister Vito has described as a

444
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:56,449
tragicomedy this discussion about a

445
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:58,340
multi-speed Europe from becoming

446
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,550
divisive because it is by a state your

447
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,000
divisive and if I think to the reactions

448
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:06,260
from your own country from Poland

449
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,870
including here over the past couple of

450
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,240
days with foreign minister of a

451
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,760
Tchaikovsky repeating that it would be a

452
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:16,910
disaster for the EU of this multi-speed

453
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,040
idea were to gain currency how do you

454
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,660
avoid that from happening because there

455
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,399
already is a lot of discussion as you

456
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,660
described Prime Minister about it

457
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,890
there's the white paper from the

458
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,200
Commission and so forth there are all

459
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,270
kinds of ideas floating around none of

460
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,880
them are particularly new these are sort

461
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,129
of the same ideas get recycled in new

462
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,650
packaging and and they are very divisive

463
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,630
which is why they often get kicked into

464
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,070
the long grass and nobody talks about

465
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,300
them until there's a new crisis but

466
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:48,309
what's the way forward here first of all

467
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:51,678
I think that we we there's no reason to

468
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:59,690
panic you know and we we shouldn't panic

469
00:22:51,679 --> 00:23:02,330
because first of all I am absolutely

470
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:06,410
sure that you remember the very

471
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:08,750
interesting announcement of marine lepen

472
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:12,110
it was just two days ago a few days ago

473
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:15,820
that the biggest mistake in her campaign

474
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:19,729
was the anti European rhetoric and this

475
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:25,870
suggestion that France should withdraw

476
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:29,870
from the eurozone in this part of Europe

477
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:32,629
we have sometimes a little bit skeptical

478
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,459
public opinion towards Europe like in

479
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,790
Czech Republic and very pure European

480
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,970
government at the same time in Poland

481
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:45,070
and in Hungary but ok let's talk about

482
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:47,029
Poland we have a

483
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:49,908
Euroskeptic are afraid to talk about

484
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:56,529
hungry yeah you're skeptical government

485
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:59,630
and with clearly anti-european rhetoric

486
00:23:56,529 --> 00:24:01,970
from time to time and very very true

487
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:05,270
European public opinion almost 80% of

488
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,490
polls are happy of the fact that we are

489
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,700
in the depo Poland is the member of the

490
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,640
European Union nothing is simple in in

491
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,370
in this context there is no black and

492
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:19,279
white you know political and social

493
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:22,279
landscape but I think that we should

494
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:26,260
also clarify what we what we mean when

495
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:28,970
we talk about to a multi-speed in Europe

496
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,830
let's actually macro so I take the macro

497
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,200
ideas for example where he's talking

498
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,510
about a eurozone Parliament finance

499
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,250
minister and so forth which is basically

500
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,649
a parallel structure in fact it's

501
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:43,610
nothing new and nothing extravagant to

502
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:48,039
talk about specific and different

503
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:52,719
political or legal formats in the EU

504
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:57,710
first of all and a group of enhanced

505
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:00,950
cooperation are foreseen by tricky as

506
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,409
you know and we have maybe the most

507
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:07,039
spectacular examples of this enhanced

508
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:10,490
cooperation is eurozone or or Schengen

509
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,590
and it's I think it's quite natural in

510
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:16,480
this kind of very complex political

511
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:21,379
system like that you that you have

512
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,779
differences different level of

513
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,590
integration and also we have also the

514
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:28,760
different political clubs my experience

515
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:32,570
also as the previous polish Prime

516
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:35,149
Minister is that it's they were and they

517
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:40,270
are very useful in the process of when

518
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:43,789
we are looking for for compromise like

519
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:48,289
political clubs I mean this kind of form

520
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:52,090
of like visa fraud group by mark Benelux

521
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:52,090
Nordic countries etc etc

522
00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:01,720
in fact what is the real threat today

523
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:04,550
it's not the two or multi-speed or a

524
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,950
different level of integration this is

525
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:09,340
our reality it will get reality it was

526
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:13,330
always our political reality in the you

527
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:16,120
the real threat is not a different speed

528
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:19,429
the real threat is a different

529
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:22,159
destination of different direction it

530
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:23,930
means that what is for me that the

531
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,500
biggest problem today in Europe is that

532
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:34,670
we have some some political parties some

533
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:38,570
government politicians media etc etc who

534
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:43,540
are questioning today the essence of the

535
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:47,860
you the essence of Europe essence means

536
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:52,970
liberal democracy freedom tolerance

537
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:55,610
freedom of speech this conviction that

538
00:26:52,970 --> 00:27:01,250
what we need today to re-establish a

539
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:02,899
solidarity among other countries with a

540
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,100
liberal democracy like the United States

541
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:13,550
upon g7 or or including also Australia

542
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:15,709
South Korea New Zealand because the real

543
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:19,820
possible and the most brutal conflict

544
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:26,300
will be between this traditional free

545
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:28,639
world and new powers which intent it was

546
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:31,520
absolutely clear I've had it in in

547
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,510
Munich it was a if I remember well

548
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,129
Lavrov intervention in unique I can feel

549
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:39,560
this during our discussions with our

550
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,660
Chinese partners that that what the

551
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:45,980
intent is in fact to establish a new

552
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:48,650
so-called post west order and I think

553
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,720
it's this is the the real challenge and

554
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,340
all the differences between our Member

555
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,470
States in that you but this discussion

556
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,899
between the Member States is often wind

557
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,190
in the sails of the parties that you're

558
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,410
talking about who take a very

559
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,990
Euroskeptic view so is it really a

560
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:05,750
solution to just sort of you know

561
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,250
continue the status quo and to continue

562
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,150
talking the Europeans are very good at

563
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,560
talking about

564
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,450
future but when it really comes down to

565
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,669
brass tacks it gets much more difficult

566
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,050
are we at five minutes to midnight as

567
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,550
some people are suggesting that if

568
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:20,060
something but fundamentally doesn't

569
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:22,129
change that it is in danger of yeah but

570
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,780
you know just run amok that this bits

571
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,510
about about to the future of liberal

572
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,700
democracy all values principles this is

573
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,440
not a dispute between a group of member

574
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,370
states against the other group of

575
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,870
feminists it's a permanent and very deep

576
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:39,739
divisions and and disputes and arguments

577
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:42,979
among all European societies we have the

578
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:45,470
same problem also in a global context

579
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,040
for example today the United States it

580
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:50,960
means that if this is for me a

581
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,300
civilizational challenge not not only

582
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,340
you know a part of our permanent

583
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,240
negotiations in Europe and avec

584
00:28:55,340 --> 00:29:04,939
historian II know I I thought it may be

585
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:09,950
my last remark but it this is our in

586
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:13,480
fact our political heritage this

587
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:18,860
permanent process of disputes to

588
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:25,040
compromise and to for example you know

589
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:30,550
to remember grief versus Persia during

590
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:35,360
the first and second person well and if

591
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:40,690
you remember who who on the wall it was

592
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:48,679
Greece without effective executive power

593
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:56,770
with constantly disputes and debates

594
00:29:48,680 --> 00:30:01,660
between the city-states police I and

595
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:07,450
this very complex constantly arguing

596
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:10,250
organization of Greek police they they

597
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:15,460
confront with the centralized well

598
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:18,950
organized in fact authoritarian power as

599
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,429
specialists but Greece won the

600
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:23,760
confrontation

601
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:26,720
it means that for me the main question

602
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,250
today is not not the question how can we

603
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,179
reorganize the traditional European

604
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:35,279
model of very complex sophisticated

605
00:30:32,179 --> 00:30:39,360
checks and balances political system

606
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,480
it's that the real problem and the real

607
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,299
challenge is how we can protect this

608
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,210
very unique model it's not as fast as a

609
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:51,889
political model in I mean fasting in the

610
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,539
[Music]

611
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:57,990
making decision process for sure like in

612
00:30:54,539 --> 00:31:00,629
russia or turkey or in other or in china

613
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,270
but I'm absolutely sure that this is one

614
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:05,730
of the reason why Europe is still the

615
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:09,299
best place in the world this unique

616
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:13,080
system of limitation for every executive

617
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:19,200
power this permanent process of debate

618
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:21,600
this desire to find it and then every

619
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,309
single day compromise among member

620
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,770
states for me this is not our

621
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:31,110
disadvantage this is maybe the the

622
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:34,440
biggest at the best part of our

623
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:36,209
political rally I would like to come to

624
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,679
the audience in just just a moment so

625
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,870
prepare your questions I just had one

626
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,140
more question for the prime ministers

627
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:45,239
there is a lot of hope now in some

628
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,679
quarters that Germany and France in

629
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,010
particular after the German election

630
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:55,919
will take Europe forward that they will

631
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:57,658
pursue a grand reform plan when people I

632
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,010
find in central Eastern Europe hear this

633
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:00,870
they're not always they're not always

634
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:04,529
happy about it it's is it really

635
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:07,080
possible in an EU of 27 for Germany and

636
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:09,419
France to act as the motor as they as

637
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,590
they have historically maybe Prime

638
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,590
Minister feet so if you want to start

639
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,408
with that yes so much Pimentel all let's

640
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:19,230
go opera I already said that the Germany

641
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:21,600
in France may be the new engine of

642
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:25,020
integration mainly in relation to the

643
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,418
eurozone I wasn't thinking about some

644
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,590
principal changes in the functioning of

645
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,919
the European Union

646
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:36,570
and I have to agree with what Donald

647
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:40,950
said we shouldn't worry about proposals

648
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:42,960
that appear on a daily basis no we

649
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,519
receive the proposal to have a Minister

650
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,220
of Finance or perhaps there should be

651
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:49,860
new Institute's which have not existed

652
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,499
in the European Union before photography

653
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:56,969
is however I would consider it to be

654
00:32:52,499 --> 00:33:01,789
along evil but our union started to only

655
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:05,490
focus so upon itself institutions are

656
00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:07,559
functions and and disputes which country

657
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:10,440
will get which functions those are

658
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:13,190
prestigious posts in the European Union

659
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,679
and I am one of those prime ministers

660
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:19,470
are not excited about the idea to reopen

661
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:20,789
the fundamental treaties when we talk

662
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,980
about the Treaty of function of the

663
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:24,950
European Union for example and I think

664
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,840
the fundamental treaties create

665
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:30,629
sufficient room to move forward for

666
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,759
example the system of the so-called

667
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:35,459
enhanced cooperation that's a mechanism

668
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:37,769
monkey language can give a chance to

669
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,200
some countries to move forward in some

670
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:43,169
areas and other countries in very very

671
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:47,639
areas and one more remark if I may

672
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:50,369
oh sure service RJ Nikki did I ever say

673
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:52,799
that sometimes it is about methodology

674
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:54,899
we apply to our work and it's good that

675
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,299
we discussed this methodology at the

676
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:59,939
summit in Bratislava and then again look

677
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:02,340
arabic and we arrived at the first

678
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:06,389
results i would like to appreciate

679
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:09,389
donald's approach at the last that was

680
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:13,319
something to when we gave clear

681
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:15,480
political guidelines how to behave in

682
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:18,329
the negotiations with the United Kingdom

683
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,310
this document will survive these are big

684
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:22,740
very well prepared and we adopted in

685
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:24,719
here in five minutes after 5 minutes of

686
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,209
negotiations we were able to adopt it

687
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,730
and then we were had a general political

688
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:32,250
discussion but we have to learn and we

689
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,899
do it in the Fischer grant for group and

690
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,980
perhaps the vichy grant you know could

691
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:37,500
you be a good example

692
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,610
let's not table things that divide us

693
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,080
here it's clear

694
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,630
well the Commission comes with a

695
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,750
proposal today that every country should

696
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,640
pay 300,000 euros for any immigrant they

697
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,889
do not receive or perhaps that there

698
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,210
should be new obligatory clothes it's a

699
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:57,609
very few throw a stone among a most

700
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,240
water birds it's impossible to agree

701
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:02,950
from you know for functions on the

702
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,109
principle that this is where we can

703
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,509
agree so let's agree and if we cannot

704
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:11,440
agree we work on the lower level and we

705
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,120
are really high level I'm not as

706
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,980
skeptical it's a straight knee if you

707
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,560
started but you cannot even imagine what

708
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,570
it means when twenty eight heads of

709
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,640
state and government meet without having

710
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,920
to anything agreed and perhaps we have

711
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,629
eight nine hours of deliberations and

712
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,880
all of the sudden in the morning at 3:00

713
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:33,280
a.m. or 3:30 a.m. magically the heads of

714
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,200
state and government agree now when th

715
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,480
country's different interest national

716
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,370
interest back in the name of European

717
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,700
Union at the end of the day they can

718
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:45,160
arrive at a conclusion at an agreement

719
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:47,770
so on there are obviously things we

720
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,870
could improve but I wouldn't go against

721
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,509
the principles of my opinion I wouldn't

722
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:54,730
touch the foundations on which the

723
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,470
European Union is based and even though

724
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,200
we are a small country not the decisive

725
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:01,240
country that we will be very cooperative

726
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,180
we want to be inside we want to have a

727
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:06,250
say but we also want to bring the

728
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,410
Europeans into that what is what is your

729
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,000
view of this is do you also think that

730
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,740
there might be a need for cosmetic

731
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,410
changes maybe not the kind of deep

732
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:18,060
reforms that were hearing discussed in

733
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,060
in Paris and Berlin these days

734
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:25,270
masha'allah de Saavedra Prakriti mobile

735
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:27,250
government physics has studied that we

736
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:29,440
are against opening the fundamental

737
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,150
treaties the basic pieces we should

738
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,820
focus on steps that will be

739
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:39,160
comprehensible to our people and steps

740
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:41,020
that will be useful for the European

741
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,290
Union and member states

742
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:46,030
I think strengthening our security is

743
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,670
one of the priorities protecting the

744
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,430
external borders of fighting terrorism

745
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,560
stabilizing regions

746
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:55,839
in the neighborhood the of the European

747
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:58,380
Union but obviously there are economic

748
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:02,200
goals of promoting economic growth

749
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:05,290
promoting investment in Europe promoting

750
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,549
a technology change so that Europe is a

751
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:15,190
competitive unit also in future so I'm

752
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:19,200
happy that we do not go some long

753
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:21,700
winding deliberations regarding

754
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,410
fundamental treaties and nobody would be

755
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,870
able to understand apart from a few

756
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:28,029
experts but I'm very happy that the Rome

757
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:29,830
conclusions and Bratislava and Malta

758
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:33,130
conclusions the last summits of the

759
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:35,230
European Council say that we are

760
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:37,750
addressing specific comprehensible

761
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:40,600
issues that have practical solutions and

762
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:44,140
the issues that we encounter in our

763
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:46,480
daily life you mentioned that we just

764
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:48,520
discussed here without specific results

765
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,500
but the the agreement with Turkey is a

766
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,810
specific result that is the migration

767
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:55,450
pressure we have prepared a series of

768
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:56,980
measures helping us to fight terrorism

769
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:58,839
for example in the exchange of

770
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:04,780
information or gathering information for

771
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:09,600
example about passengers transport in

772
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:12,760
Europe we can also comment who is

773
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:15,250
entering the simplified regime in Europe

774
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,710
so for the last two three years we have

775
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,510
encountered many security crises and

776
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,880
we've dealt with them and about the

777
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,910
multi-speed Europa it seems to be not a

778
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,500
greater problem but if you look at the

779
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:29,740
practical space that we have in Europe

780
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,590
then certainly one of the lines is it a

781
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:36,370
Schengen then another would be euro zone

782
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:39,460
and then we have for example Romania and

783
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:42,460
Bulgaria who apparently are frozen

784
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:47,710
outside of Schengen and nothing is

785
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:51,299
moving if we take a look at how to get

786
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:55,049
to the faster lane for example in a

787
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:56,788
and this leads to the worries that the

788
00:38:55,049 --> 00:38:58,439
Czech Republic has regarding the

789
00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:00,359
multi-speed Europe yes if there is a

790
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:02,428
multi-speed Europe then we should have

791
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,859
clear transparent rules for everybody so

792
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:07,679
that all member states out of the 27 if

793
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:10,140
they so decide could join the faster

794
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,729
lane and that relates to Schengen that

795
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,098
relates to the euro zone and that

796
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:17,249
relates to structures that the euro zone

797
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:21,919
which is to create so a healthy measure

798
00:39:17,249 --> 00:39:25,859
of cactus ism is right Mike I think and

799
00:39:21,919 --> 00:39:29,219
about the franco-german engine or

800
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:33,479
integration engine I think this will

801
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:34,769
sort of increase the dynamism in Europe

802
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:37,198
but on the other hand I would be very

803
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:42,749
happy if the discussion would not need

804
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:44,849
to disrupting the single market the

805
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:47,848
Czechs are a very practical nation and

806
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:49,709
we appreciate the fact that we have four

807
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:51,569
basic freedoms in the European Union we

808
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:53,939
have the single market and we would be

809
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:56,249
very unhappy if this franco-german

810
00:39:53,939 --> 00:39:59,368
discussion would lead to introducing

811
00:39:56,249 --> 00:40:01,979
some protectionist measures non-tariff

812
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:03,419
barriers to trade within individual

813
00:40:01,979 --> 00:40:05,368
member states that wouldn't be a very

814
00:40:03,419 --> 00:40:07,069
good I would like to go to the audience

815
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:12,109
now there was a question in the back

816
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:15,058
here arm excellencies Europe enjoy the

817
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:17,578
value that we all could be proud of and

818
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:20,999
they were wonderful matter of democracy

819
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:23,669
but now these values are challenged

820
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:26,399
because different individual or certain

821
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:29,368
individual or certain European states

822
00:40:26,399 --> 00:40:31,589
are having definitions of terrorism

823
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:33,449
security and their own and that does not

824
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:35,759
share with all the other members and

825
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:37,319
that the way the policy they have for

826
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:39,359
its money laundering financing

827
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:43,859
sponsoring terrorism a certain state or

828
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:46,049
or elements so what measures do you take

829
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,639
or what kind of assurance do you give to

830
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:51,149
the entire world especially to your own

831
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:52,949
citizen that you would not support or

832
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:54,569
you would give the surance to the

833
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:56,609
minority especially the muslim

834
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:58,769
minorities in europe that they would not

835
00:40:56,609 --> 00:41:01,679
be stereotyped they would not be treated

836
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:04,529
differently as part of your own citizens

837
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,670
part of your own countries so this is

838
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:09,990
a new Europe you need to be clear about

839
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,970
messaging because mixed messages are

840
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,060
given by you and what's actually the

841
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:17,819
question you'd like to ask what kind of

842
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:20,250
assurance and what measures EU is taking

843
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,410
in fact to have a clear narrative for

844
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,780
all the European Member States and at

845
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,089
the same time assurance for the Muslim

846
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,230
communities in Europe I think we get I

847
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,460
would like to collect a couple of

848
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,950
questions because time short we've got

849
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,230
another one right here okay thank you I

850
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:36,029
saw the associate professor my question

851
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:43,620
is just remember to keep president short

852
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:47,090
cost exactly what what does the EU

853
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:50,839
performance in refugee crisis tell us

854
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:54,660
about the EU in terms of humanitarian

855
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:59,460
values and in terms of EU as a global

856
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:03,120
actor and how can an organization claim

857
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:05,370
global credibility unless it practices

858
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:09,569
what it preaches when it comes to

859
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:22,770
humanitarian values thank you okay maybe

860
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:26,700
then we've got one here microphone

861
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:41,370
you've got Hold'em I don't get

862
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:43,540
microphones switched on actually mr.

863
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:47,750
just

864
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:50,990
okay and a quick question to mr. tusk in

865
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,910
the event of brexit how long do you

866
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:55,520
think it might take for an independent

867
00:42:52,910 --> 00:43:01,220
Scotland to rejoin a Europe

868
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:04,310
it doesn't wish to be okay maybe we

869
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:07,399
start with those with those three do you

870
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:09,440
want to start Prime Minister Prime

871
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:14,660
Minister veto on the the security

872
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:17,930
question yellow if I may I would focus

873
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:21,368
on the first question but also he car

874
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:23,450
that touched on the guarantees

875
00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:26,560
safeguards which the European Union as a

876
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:30,399
whole should give to its citizens and

877
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,900
safeguards it should give to minorities

878
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,270
in relation to fighting terrorism this

879
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,020
is how I understood the essence of the

880
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:39,500
question welcome the god you're so

881
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,099
stupid

882
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,480
also I represented the Slovak Republic

883
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:45,530
also broken I would obscure sudha

884
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,500
problem the European Court of Human

885
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:50,839
Rights for 80 years in Strasbourg our

886
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:53,300
balsamic brownies are and I was a legal

887
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:57,440
representative of the government of the

888
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,869
Slovak nation and perhaps I would ask a

889
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,200
simple question here as well my sauce

890
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:05,300
Bravo shall we because what do you eat

891
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,259
Ziggler behave - a thief who steals a

892
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:12,859
bicycle in the same manner as to someone

893
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:15,560
who is organizing a bomb attack and

894
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:18,680
killed 50 people on that one of you and

895
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:23,589
we know that lucky for this person has

896
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,589
information that may lead our to Yahoo

897
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,550
ashing the little networks of other

898
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,960
attackers this is such question which we

899
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,660
have not yet answered at the European

900
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:35,510
level and I think that we are dealing

901
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:39,348
with it more individually and that leads

902
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:43,849
to a high degree of tensions in

903
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:45,200
individual member states I would reply

904
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:50,720
to a question

905
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,939
to our first task today is to ensure a

906
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,578
more intensive cooperation in exchanging

907
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:58,760
information together with the Prime

908
00:44:55,579 --> 00:45:00,920
Minister sub-account we were on TV

909
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,339
recently and he said that this is the

910
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:07,099
foundation of fighting terrorism and the

911
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:11,619
safeguards that we give to new citizens

912
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:13,910
and to minorities based on the

913
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:15,320
applicable legislation that we have in

914
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,848
the Member States today I wouldn't look

915
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,079
for anything else I'm just replying to

916
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:23,089
your question with a counter question

917
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:27,410
shouldn't we perhaps go a bit further in

918
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:29,200
fighting terrorism in some areas um what

919
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:32,930
is important to have a good feeling that

920
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,549
I wouldn't have to take my shoes off at

921
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,259
the airport or perhaps that I wouldn't

922
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,810
have to take my belt off at the airport

923
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:43,820
and then on the other hand have the

924
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:45,740
unpleasant feeling bad then if despite

925
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,320
these measures someone will blow up an

926
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:50,810
airplane so the line between human

927
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,910
rights and fighting terrorism is

928
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:56,060
somewhere else than between human rights

929
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:58,879
and the classic fight against crime and

930
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:02,869
perhaps we should discuss this topic in

931
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:06,550
more detail and then another topic you

932
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:08,839
are sir ask the question Diavel of

933
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:12,440
humanitarian approach of the European

934
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:14,480
Union to migrants or humane and of

935
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:18,530
course subjective of the women we all

936
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:21,290
are aware that these people in a very

937
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:21,920
very difficult situation and they need

938
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:23,839
our help

939
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,180
well how about just and we have the rich

940
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,819
part of the world if I were to talk

941
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,069
about the European Union as a whole

942
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:34,150
above that is something else and don't

943
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:37,250
be angry with me but above the humane

944
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:40,609
approach on the part of the EU towards

945
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:43,010
these people before me safety of the

946
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:45,259
European citizens is first safety and

947
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,160
security of EU citizens everybody so

948
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,380
let's go

949
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,660
and in Slovakia I'm discussing about

950
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:53,269
Florrick citizens in the case of

951
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:54,379
European Union I solve your win the

952
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:58,788
European citizens what happened in

953
00:46:54,380 --> 00:47:01,309
Manchester is incomprehensible and it

954
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:06,079
will perhaps lead us to other

955
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:10,009
discussions on the on European level and

956
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,359
I do believe that will not discuss

957
00:47:10,009 --> 00:47:14,420
whether we need a new Minister of

958
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,420
Finance or whether we should open up the

959
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:19,250
treaties but we'll discuss how to calm

960
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:22,970
down the European public so that they

961
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:27,170
feel safe when it comes to measures in

962
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:30,348
fighting terrorism president tusk if

963
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:32,359
you'd like to address the question from

964
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,769
the Scottish gentleman and if you could

965
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:35,690
keep your answer as short as possible

966
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:38,779
maybe we can then take another couple of

967
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:39,890
questions if you want to think about

968
00:47:38,779 --> 00:47:46,789
what your questions are in the next

969
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:49,400
couple minutes sir yeah yep Europe is

970
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:51,799
still the most open continent or the

971
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:56,809
most open place in the world for

972
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:59,019
refugees and migrants and we have

973
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:03,349
thousands and thousands people

974
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:04,899
organizations institutions deeply

975
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:08,509
engaged in humanitarian assistance

976
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:11,029
there's no reason to complain when it

977
00:48:08,509 --> 00:48:15,230
comes to this very context of migration

978
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:18,380
crisis Europe is of course not a perfect

979
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:21,890
one but still the best example in the

980
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:23,900
world also when it comes to to this

981
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:28,690
readiness to sacrifice something not

982
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:33,079
only money but also our time emotions in

983
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:35,029
did you know during our discussions for

984
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:39,470
example with our global partners about

985
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:42,619
migration and I could feel some kind of

986
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:45,549
fatigue or that they are tired I mean

987
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:50,299
for example the United States Canada

988
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:54,270
even Japan on the this discussions about

989
00:48:50,299 --> 00:48:57,810
migration but as you

990
00:48:54,270 --> 00:49:01,140
if you know well when it comes to Canada

991
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:04,529
we are talking about 20,000 refugees and

992
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:09,230
migrants I mean that during the

993
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:13,460
migration crisis Japan close to zero

994
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:17,610
Europe more than one and half million

995
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:22,740
this is why I think that of course we

996
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:24,900
have we have at different approaches we

997
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:29,069
have a different rhetorics in Europe

998
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:33,030
about migration and and different

999
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:40,920
emotions but generally speaking the EU

1000
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:43,350
as a as a group of States and Europe as

1001
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:50,690
a whole continent it is still the most

1002
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:55,830
friendly the most open place for

1003
00:49:50,690 --> 00:50:00,240
migrants and and refugees when it comes

1004
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:06,000
to Muslims minority and if this very

1005
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:08,810
visible risk that that some political

1006
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,820
elites Mazen maybe it's the worst word

1007
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:14,160
there was definition Alex but some

1008
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:20,490
political groups and they are ready to

1009
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:24,810
to to claim that in fact Islam is a

1010
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:27,089
synonym of terrorism of course we can't

1011
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:31,350
agree with this kind of simplification

1012
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:34,619
on the other hand we should understand

1013
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:37,080
also emotions especially after such an

1014
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:37,800
event like Manchester or other attacks

1015
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,980
in Europe

1016
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:45,720
my advice is on my suggestion is that we

1017
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:51,030
have to start but the genuine

1018
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:54,149
discussions with Muslim minorities

1019
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:58,080
representative how can we cooperate

1020
00:50:54,150 --> 00:51:00,540
together to exclude Islamic radicals

1021
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,600
from our societies - because I think

1022
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:07,308
it's not enough today to show only our I

1023
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:13,410
mean Muslim solidarity after attacks

1024
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:15,779
without deep engagement from Muslim

1025
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:20,009
communities in our countries we have no

1026
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:24,720
chance to to to eliminate this radical

1027
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:27,779
part of of the Islamic world if if we if

1028
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,459
we want not only to discuss but to act

1029
00:51:27,779 --> 00:51:31,319
something very substantive when it comes

1030
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:36,029
to the radicalization

1031
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:39,630
we need a real engagement from from from

1032
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:43,049
Muslims in Europe without this we will

1033
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:45,869
be as round as helpless as yesterday and

1034
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:50,160
this is my my appeal and if we want to

1035
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:52,019
stop this very dangerous evolution when

1036
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,999
it comes to ideas and emotions in Europe

1037
00:51:52,019 --> 00:52:01,618
I mean if if we want to stop our

1038
00:51:53,999 --> 00:52:06,480
radicals our I mean Christians so we

1039
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:08,910
need massive engagement this positive

1040
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,390
engagement in our common fight against

1041
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:14,640
radicalism extremism and and I think we

1042
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:15,779
should instead of course terror we

1043
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,670
should leave that subject there thank

1044
00:52:15,779 --> 00:52:19,619
you thank you very much we are running

1045
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:24,779
out of time unfortunately I had one last

1046
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:26,400
question but what about Scotland I saw

1047
00:52:24,779 --> 00:52:29,220
the I thought I thought that you were

1048
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,720
some religion along skillfully dodging

1049
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:34,019
that question I thought but if you want

1050
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:37,169
to address it quickly please little

1051
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:42,988
suggestion yes I still I'm not ready

1052
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:47,190
okay have I just had a very quick

1053
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:49,920
question for for the panel before we end

1054
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,839
the subject is European disunion the

1055
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,630
future of Europe and my question would

1056
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,450
be do you think that we will see some

1057
00:52:54,630 --> 00:53:00,119
kind of reform of the EU over the next

1058
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:03,118
couple of years some further integration

1059
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,589
some steps to repair the sort of myriad

1060
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:08,180
of problems and I would like to begin

1061
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:10,499
with Prime Minister Sobotka

1062
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:12,359
Takata from Jewish there's me a lady

1063
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:14,019
that I hope that we are already seeing

1064
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:17,828
the changes

1065
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:24,459
so we can influence it we can experience

1066
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:26,559
it and it will certainly regard security

1067
00:53:24,459 --> 00:53:29,589
foreign policy economic policy and I

1068
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,890
hope that Europe will stay open for

1069
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:35,019
countries which meet the criteria to

1070
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:38,529
join the opinion and I think that in the

1071
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:40,689
Balkans it will be a quite important for

1072
00:53:38,529 --> 00:53:42,999
the stability of the region so it's not

1073
00:53:40,689 --> 00:53:46,118
about big plans or big starts but we've

1074
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:48,308
already started and we have important

1075
00:53:46,119 --> 00:53:51,880
political goals that we agreed upon in

1076
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:53,829
Rome when we commemorated the University

1077
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,439
of the treaties of Rome and now we

1078
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:58,329
should not just withdraw into

1079
00:53:56,439 --> 00:54:01,058
bureaucratic approaches and we should

1080
00:53:58,329 --> 00:54:03,339
try to accomplish things speedily the

1081
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:04,869
final word go to our host Prime Minister

1082
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:07,719
Peter you have before

1083
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:10,809
what povedilla showed us we are the

1084
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:13,559
replies yes we will witness certain

1085
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:15,699
changes let me just express my

1086
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:18,579
conviction that those changes will be

1087
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:21,579
pragmatic rational and I was very

1088
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:25,029
pleased when a Donald was elected for

1089
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:26,799
the first time as a top representative

1090
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:32,319
of the European Union and when he

1091
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:34,449
managed to win again even though maybe

1092
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,429
it wasn't as simple as the first time

1093
00:54:34,449 --> 00:54:38,259
and I'm saying that because growing

1094
00:54:36,429 --> 00:54:42,279
young countries such as the Czech

1095
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:44,229
Republic Slovakia Poland but I have to

1096
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:46,029
include Hungary when we talk about the

1097
00:54:44,229 --> 00:54:48,999
Vichy grab group these countries

1098
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:52,390
underwent a unique transformation

1099
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:55,390
process and in other countries it took

1100
00:54:52,390 --> 00:55:00,788
much longer and sometimes it seems to me

1101
00:54:55,390 --> 00:55:04,719
and excuse us for saying these things

1102
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:06,429
that perhaps we have a molten healthier

1103
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:10,089
common sense when we look at things we

1104
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:12,729
are more pragmatic and I hope I believe

1105
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:14,619
that after Donald's leadership the

1106
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:20,500
pragmatism will win and that we will not

1107
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:24,500
witness just empty words as

1108
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:26,770
and that we will witness solutions that

1109
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:29,869
will help everybody it's not only about

1110
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:32,540
people being more satisfied in their

1111
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:35,720
opinion I see a lot of the nervousness

1112
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:37,400
among young people and it's also

1113
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,830
supported by the media and by the

1114
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:41,540
Euroskeptics and therefore that way I

1115
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:44,150
would like to thank the organizers of

1116
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:49,400
this exceptional event Montego Bay mob

1117
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:51,800
that they also give room to these topics

1118
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:54,890
and on the part of the Slovak government

1119

year and if you manage to implement all

1122
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:07,460
the changes that you've planned you'll

1123
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,410
still have our support thank you very

00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:29,150
watershed in many respects let me share

00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:29,960
tremendous following of our debates here

1164
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:33,650
where life of Weber life on

1165
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:36,349
MSNBC AP and the International coverage

1166
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:38,710
was really huge thank you for all the

1167
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:42,770
journalists who were covering this but

1168
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:46,369
2017 was very special for us at globe

1169
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:48,710
SEC this year we introduced for the

1170
00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:51,040
first time the second stage where we

1171
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:54,680
were discussing the multiple futures

1172
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,830
that were predicted and debated and I

1173
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,419
think it was a fascinating to follow

1174
00:58:57,830 --> 00:59:02,150
these discussions and we will definitely

1175
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:06,410
continue with that in the future in the

1176
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:08,180
upcoming conferences but also it was for

1177
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:10,700
the first time that the globe SEC Policy

1178
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:12,799
Institute with its new management and

1179
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,618
the international team led by jakub

1180
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:18,109
Vishnevsky played such a crucial role in

1181
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:20,450
providing the background research for

1182
00:59:18,109 --> 00:59:23,029
all deliberations the initiatives of the

1183
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:25,669
Institute were part of the solution that

1184
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:29,119
were being proposed and considered and I

1185
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:33,080
think that is of tremendous tremendous

1186
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,880
success but I want to thank to several

1187
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:36,890
people without whom globe SEC would not

1188
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:41,150
be possible and first of all let me

if I have one personal take away from

1240
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,500
the conference

1241
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:38,960
it is the conviction that democracy with

1242
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:41,750
all its downsides has one amazing

1243
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:44,630
quality it is able to constantly

1244
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:48,970
reinvent itself bring new ideas and

1245
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:52,430
adapt to the changing circumstances and

1246
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:55,009
we can get ahead of the events we need

1247
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:56,419
to add up to the future but also make it

1248
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:59,390
the way we like it

1249
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:01,310
and it is among us among about this

1250
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:03,319
community which is here so let me leave

conclusions I'd seen the confirmed

1259
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:30,439
conspiracies in the world so nothing is

1260

and progress
