for me to introduce you the esteemed

2
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:51,530
leaders of the globe SEC NATO adaptation

3
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:54,139
initiate the steering committee namely

4
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,180
General John Allen ambassador Alexander

5
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,000
Vespa and professor Julien Lindley

6
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,610
French as you may know the globe SEC

7
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,500
NATO adaptation initiative is glops X

8
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:06,439
contribution to the debate about the

9
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,210
future of the Alliance it aims to

10
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,610
address the pressing challenges of our

11
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:13,450
age and to provide the transatlantic

12
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:16,280
leaders with a set of complex adaptation

13
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,830
guidelines in the upcoming minute

14
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,899
General Allen ambassador vershbow and

15
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,210
professor Lindley French will introduce

16
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:27,080
you the initiative and the interim

17
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:30,080
report general ambassador professor the

18
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:32,679
floor is yours ladies and gentleman good

19
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:37,429
morning but if any of you just saw the

20
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:38,811
panel that we just ran I think you'll be

21
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,640
familiar with some of the explanation

22
00:31:38,811 --> 00:31:44,510
that I provided to the audience this

23
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,690
morning on this study a year ago at the

24
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:50,540
globe SEC conference I introduced in one

25
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:54,500
of the closed sessions to a number of

26
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:56,990
the audience the concept of a globe SEC

27
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,150
sponsored long-term study on NATO

28
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:02,811
adaptation and the challenges that NATO

29
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:05,960
would face in the future in a very

30
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:08,360
dynamic and uncertain world what we have

31
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,800
since done is we have organized into a

32
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,139
steering committee that works very

33
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:15,200
closely with globe SEC and in the

34
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:19,160
aftermath of the Warsaw summit in July

35
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,530
and the excellent communique that came

36
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:25,820
out of that summit which called on the

37
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:27,830
alliance to be capable of adapting to

38
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,889
these uncertainties in the future we

39
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:32,480
have undertaken a series of papers which

40
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,240
are listed in this if you've not seen

41
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,250
this report it's all over the building

42
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,430
so help yourself to a copy of it and

43
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:42,080
page seven in the report lists the

44
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,030
papers that we have written to date many

45
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,710
of which have contributed to the

46
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,430
substance of this this is an interim

47
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:52,220
report this report sets the conditions

48
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:56,470
and attempts to describe the environment

49
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:58,250
in which NATO must adapt for the future

50
00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,990
later in the

51
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:04,940
year we will issue the final report and

52
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:08,540
probably will see that will evaluate it

53
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:11,780
over time after the final report is is

54
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:14,240
issued the final report will look like a

55
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:17,360
series of executive summaries on key

56
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,790
major areas with supporting detailed

57
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,149
recommendations and it'll come out

58
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:26,680
towards the latter part of 2017 at

59
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:29,750
roughly the 50-year anniversary of

60
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,410
something called the harm L report harm

61
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:37,280
L being a Belgian diplomat who issued a

62
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:39,710
report in 1967 on the necessity for NATO

63
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,600
to adapt in at that point a very

64
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,730
challenging time as well so what we're

65
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,090
hoping to do is to help the leadership

66
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,160
of NATO and help in capitals with a

67
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,560
description of the world in which we

68
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,990
live today that necessitates NATO to

69
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,960
think differently but also to help

70
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,910
capitals to understand how they within

71
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,970
the context of the North Atlantic

72
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:04,130
Alliance should ultimately can consider

73
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,860
adaptation and I'll close in just a

74
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:09,380
second in broad terms when you read this

75
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:13,130
paper I'll summarize by saying that we

76
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:17,360
would hypothesize that there are six

77
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:20,480
principal drivers for adaptation for

78
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:24,020
them our directional the first being the

79
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,780
drivers from the east the which is

80
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,759
Russia and the complexities of the

81
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,680
Russia both as a threat but Russia is a

82
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,260
challenge and we're very clear that we

83
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,699
think that the whole business as the

84
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,350
Deputy Secretary General said this

85
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,639
morning of deterrence and dialogue

86
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,589
should move forward together we should

87
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,299
be talking to the Russians the

88
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:43,850
challenges of instability to the south

89
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,820
but it's its instability that's as a

90
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:49,549
direct result of broad failures of

91
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:52,430
governance which has precipitated for

92
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:55,910
civil wars large amounts of migration

93
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:58,009
and the enhancement of terrorist

94
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:00,529
networks and terrorism targeting Europe

95
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,230
itself the potential challenges of the

96
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,450
far north now with climate change etc

97
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,880
the emergence of the potential for the

98
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,370
Northeast Passage which is an economic

99
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,080
passage but also the exposure now of

100
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:15,470
vast segments

101
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:18,620
of the Arctic seabed under which we may

102
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:20,540
find substantial energy resources that

103
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:24,290
could be available there's a potential

104
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,670
recipe for competition potentially

105
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,740
confrontation and we would hope of

106
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,990
course not conflict and then the

107
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,459
internal driver which is the the nature

108
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,620
of the security environment within

109
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,620
Europe itself where we would propose

110
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:40,040
enhanced cooperation between NATO and

111
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:41,870
the EU but also NATO being able to

112
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,520
support partner states within the

113
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:46,430
Alliance to deal with terrorism and

114
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,229
insecurity directional drivers we talked

115
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:53,029
about an organizational driver one is is

116
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:57,350
if we are successful in attaining the 2%

117
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:59,120
of GDP that NATO has agreed as a goal to

118
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:02,060
achieve that could be somewhere between

119
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:05,689
100 and 119 billion dollars over a year

120
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:07,910
over years how do we spend this this is

121
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:09,680
a very important question how do we

122
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:12,560
ultimately take that kind of money and

123
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,229
and make it relevant ultimately to the

124
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,689
overarching needs of NATO as an alliance

125
00:36:15,229 --> 00:36:20,509
would also remain true to the

126
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:23,390
procurement strategies for capabilities

127
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,939
we propose capability based procurement

128
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:28,069
strategies within both NATO and nations

129
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:29,689
how do we spend that money that's an

130
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:32,029
organizational challenge for us and then

131
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:34,120
finally the challenge of technology as I

132
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:37,910
said this morning in the panel

133
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:39,439
technology is galloping into the future

134
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,970
we can't imagine where we would have

135
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:43,759
been 10 years ago if we looked at

136
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:45,290
technology today I think 10 years from

137
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,260
now we'll think that this is the dark

138
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,300
ages in terms of technology how do we

139
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,490
harness technology to increase NATO's

140
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,500
capacity for adaptation very importantly

141
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:58,609
how do we harness technology to enhance

142
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:00,380
NATO's capacity for agility and then a

143
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:01,609
consequence of this is that the United

144
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,200
States is going to embrace these

145
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:05,750
technologies we're going to put the

146
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,330
money into that necessary is this now

147
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:11,149
creating a gap in capabilities between

148
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:13,160
the United States as a member and a

149
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:16,100
partner within NATO and the other NATO

150
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,390
players and we have to realize that and

151
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:19,819
I think we have to address that as we

152
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,770
move forward so six drivers sets the

153
00:37:19,819 --> 00:37:23,660
conditions ultimately for a report to be

154
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:25,261
issued later in the year with specific

155
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,520
recommendations and

156
00:37:25,261 --> 00:37:28,471
guys are going on so long let me just

157
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:30,511
turn the floor to the principle writer

158
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:31,921
of these reports who's done terrific

159
00:37:30,511 --> 00:37:34,741
work in this regard that's professor

160
00:37:31,921 --> 00:37:36,000
Julien Lindley French I get you on and

161
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:38,671
good morning everybody can i before I

162

and for me a great honor to be part of

170
00:37:55,621 --> 00:38:00,991
this project let me be blunt in my

171
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,811
characteristic Yorkshire way so what

172
00:38:00,991 --> 00:38:06,801
this report I mean we get a lot of these

173
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:09,570
reports coming out over over the years

174
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:11,671
but what's different about this report

175
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,491
is not just the people who are writing

176
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:17,370
it but the timing of it and it's

177
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:21,091
ambition let me offer you a brief story

178
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:23,961
let's say it's 2025 the u.s. is

179
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:25,591
overstretched in asia-pacific

180
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:29,180
overstretched in the Middle East

181
00:38:25,591 --> 00:38:32,940
relative power is shifting in the world

182
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:36,181
crises erupt simultaneously in both

183
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,971
theaters and in Europe the bottom line

184
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:42,110
is this alliance one alliance we call

185
00:38:38,971 --> 00:38:44,761
these series of reports is about

186
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:47,730
ensuring that our defence and deterrence

187
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:50,721
posture is credible and intimate in the

188
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:53,641
event of crises now for that to happen

189
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:56,641
for the United States to continue to act

190
00:38:53,641 --> 00:38:59,371
as a global stabilizer it is vital that

191
00:38:56,641 --> 00:39:03,331
the European allies simply do not simply

192
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:06,421
see NATO as a defensive tool for this

193
00:39:03,331 --> 00:39:09,751
part of the world itself but also as

194
00:39:06,421 --> 00:39:12,060
assisting as a mechanism being effective

195
00:39:09,751 --> 00:39:14,011
first responders for keeping the united

196
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:15,961
states strong where we the allies

197
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:19,431
believe the United States needs to be

198
00:39:15,961 --> 00:39:21,899
strong so fundamental change going on

199
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:25,051
technologies as John says space is

200
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:28,561
becoming an increasing contested space

201
00:39:25,051 --> 00:39:31,411
as it were cyber hyper warfare hybrid

202
00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:33,811
warfare there's an entirely new concept

203
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:35,730
of warfare that's developing that

204
00:39:33,811 --> 00:39:36,980
crosses the civil military the

205
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:39,801
technology

206
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,721
electrum which requires all of us to

207
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:44,029
have some understanding of how we're

208
00:39:41,721 --> 00:39:47,330
going to turret how we're going to

209
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:50,030
engage and if the worst case comes to

210
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:52,671
worse how we're going to fight such a

211
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,230
war that sounds tough but that is the

212
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:58,011
reality of the world into which we're

213
00:39:54,230 --> 00:40:02,061
moving and the ambition implicit in this

214
00:39:58,011 --> 00:40:05,029
project so what this report one alliance

215
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:08,061
in a 21st century world there's going to

216
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:11,061
be possibly as least as challenging as a

217
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:12,891
20th century our mission to help

218
00:40:11,061 --> 00:40:16,431
preserve the Alliance as a cornerstone

219
00:40:12,891 --> 00:40:18,591
of peace and stability in this world but

220
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:20,690
make no mistake peace through strength

221
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:23,060
thank you John thank you what a rhythm

222
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:24,080
and let me introduce the other another

223
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:25,820
member of the steering committee and

224
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,790
that's the former Deputy Secretary

225
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:31,881
General of NATO ambassador sandy verse

226
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,740
bell sandy thank you John it's a

227
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:35,211
pleasure for me to be here and I was

228
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,490
very pleased to be able to join the

229
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:40,250
steering committee within days of my

230
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:42,649
leaving my native position last fall

231
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,530
because this is indeed I think a very

232
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:48,681
important study at a time when the

233
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:52,101
Alliance is doing well but faces a very

234
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:55,341
challenging future I've been involved in

235
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:56,690
NATO throughout my career and I've

236
00:40:55,341 --> 00:41:00,080
always been impressed by NATO's

237
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:01,580
adaptability at every stage adaptation

238
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:05,540
is NATO's middle name perhaps you could

239
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,801
say but looking back at some of the

240
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:10,461
different stages I've been involved in

241
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:13,370
in the late 70s we had the INF dual

242
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:16,490
track decision we had the post Cold War

243
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:18,950
adaptation in the late 80s early 90s

244
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:21,410
post 9/11 NATO had to adapt again I

245
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:26,091
think the challenges we faced since 2014

246
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:28,490
however are far more difficult than any

247
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:29,319
of those previous adaptations so the

248
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,430
stakes are very high

249
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,410
NATO's gotten off to a good start I

250
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:35,721
think the Warsaw summit building on the

251
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,490
Wales summit laid out an agenda but it's

252
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:39,320
really only the beginning of a process I

253
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:42,950
think this study is an opportunity to

254
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:45,351
lay out longer range challenges to

255
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,091
really fully assess the changing

256
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:49,790
security environment where we're seeing

257
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:51,680
the speed of warfare accelerate to an

258
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,960
amazing degree

259
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,060
we have to deal with a much more

260
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,279
formidable and technologically advanced

261
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:00,020
adversary in Russia while at the same

262
00:41:58,279 --> 00:42:03,620
time keeping an eye on the the threats

263
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:04,939
from the south there are new challenges

264
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,199
that we're just beginning to come to

265
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,699
grips with in the Alliance such as

266
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:11,449
countering the russia's russians

267
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:14,510
anti-access area-denial cap capacity the

268
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:16,880
whole range of cyber threats both the

269
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:20,260
potential to bring down our own cyber

270
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,520
networks but also to use cyber space to

271
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:26,300
promote subversion and disinformation

272
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,800
and weaken our societies so this study

273
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,439
will address all the different

274
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,699
dimensions military and political it

275
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:33,649
will be looking at how the alliance

276
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:36,979
needs to you know raise the level of its

277
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:39,049
game in terms of dealing in environments

278
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:41,060
which will be increasingly hybrid where

279
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:43,040
we have compressed decision time shorter

280
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:45,290
warning times which puts a premium on

281
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,140
much improvement much improving how we

282
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:52,550
deal with intelligence how we streamline

283
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:54,140
our decision-making procedures what more

284
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,550
can we do to delegate authority to our

285
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,600
commanders so we don't fall behind

286
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:01,550
events as crises evolve I've been

287
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,989
particularly involved as far in the work

288
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:04,580
on the political adaptation of the

289
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:08,210
Alliance which is just as important as

290
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:10,370
the military side and here I think we

291
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,960
got off to a decent start at the Warsaw

292
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:15,799
summit with the projecting stability

293
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,939
initiative focusing on measures using

294
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,069
our partnership tools and

295
00:43:16,939 --> 00:43:20,960
capacity-building to stabilize the

296
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:22,370
southern neighborhood and to promote

297
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,239
greater resilience on the part of our

298
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:28,609
eastern neighbors but even after

299
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:31,069
Thursday's mini summits I think we still

300
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:32,750
have a long way to go to realize the

301
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:35,270
potential for NATO to have a much more

302
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:37,520
decisive impact on the stability of

303
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:40,699
surrounding regions and especially the

304
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,810
Middle East which could be the area

305
00:43:40,699 --> 00:43:44,689
where NATO could make greater

306
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:46,939
contribution of preventing terrorism by

307
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:48,859
shoring up weak States helping countries

308
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:52,580
improve governance trained local forces

309
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:55,489
so that the conditions that create

310
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:59,060
radicalization and creates an attraction

311
00:43:55,489 --> 00:44:02,149
for terrorist networks can be can be

312
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,460
prevented so I think you'll see this

313
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:06,350
report in November is quite a

314
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,050
major contribution to the debate it

315
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:10,970
won't be just another report I think it

316
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:14,810
will stand out as one with a with a

317
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:18,080
breadth and scope and a forward-looking

318
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:20,029
agenda that will make a big contribution

319
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,090
to the work of the Alliance as we go

320
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:25,100
forward so this is a group that likes to

321
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:27,080
think big and I think this report will

322
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:29,299
be an example of thinking outside the

323
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,569
box about the future of NATO Thank You

324
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,790
Sammy this is to conclude at 10 after

325
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:36,290
but I think we have put some more time

326
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,610
on the clock if we if it's okay with the

327
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,120
steering committee and those of you we

328
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:42,440
can go for about 10 15 minutes okay

329
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,150
ladies and gentlemen I would like to

330
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,650
give floor for your questions now to the

331
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:50,210
members of the steering committee of the

332
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:54,380
initiative and we may launch a question

333
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:56,000
over in that direction as well - oh my

334
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,410
former commanding general when it was in

335
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,350
Afghanistan I take my orders from him

336
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:02,500
still yes sir please anybody when I

337
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:07,759
addressed I will be happy to hear from

338
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:10,460
I'm Vermont sugar daily problem so maybe

339
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,130
and deputy secretary general get

340
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:14,890
tomorrow said that also during the panel

341
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:19,160
that you have been also in nature

342
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:23,540
presenting this initiative so so what

343
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:26,839
kind of real concrete outcome are you

344
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:29,690
expecting from this initiative in terms

345
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:33,160
of NATO adaptation do really let's say

346
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:38,780
believe that NATO will change adapt

347
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:42,100
because of your great report well we

348
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:42,100
want to make this report great again

349
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:49,370
look NATO in the end will be what NATO

350
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:49,870
is but my sense is can you all hear me

351
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:53,109
okay

352
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:55,850
is that the leadership in NATO today

353
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:58,490
whether it's the civilian leadership or

354
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:01,069
the military leadership is interested in

355
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:03,049
all the help it can get from people on

356
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:06,380
the outside who can look at the

357
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:09,020
situation the geostrategic situation

358
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:12,350
within which nato finds itself and to

359
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:15,461
propose potential means to deal with it

360
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:17,721
they may or may not use the

361
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:19,160
recommendations that we have what we

362
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:20,570
don't want to do is to give NATO a

363
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,091
recommendation that they're ultimately

364
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,711
going to do anyway nor do we want to

365
00:46:23,091 --> 00:46:26,841
give them a recommendation that that has

366
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:29,421
no substance or form to it so the

367
00:46:26,841 --> 00:46:31,069
challenge is for us to understand the

368
00:46:29,421 --> 00:46:32,569
environment to understand where NATO is

369
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:35,061
today which is part of the report we

370
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:37,131
talk about NATO today with the idea of

371
00:46:35,061 --> 00:46:39,171
providing credible recommendations for

372
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:40,819
them and we we hope it will inform their

373
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:43,310
thinking we hope it will inform their

374
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:46,551
decision-making and we hope in the end

375
00:46:43,311 --> 00:46:48,650
it would inform outcomes as well so let

376
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:51,591
me see if either my colleagues have

377
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:53,601
something yeah I think my experience

378
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:55,631
working at NATO at many different stages

379
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:58,461
of my career is that we very much

380
00:46:55,631 --> 00:47:00,500
benefit from outside input and we have a

381
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:02,450
lot of smart people working at NATO and

382
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:03,950
the nations you know send highly

383
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:05,091
qualified diplomats to be their

384
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:08,270
ambassadors but they don't have all the

385
00:47:05,091 --> 00:47:11,270
answers as we were developing the agenda

386
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:14,391
for the Warsaw summit and really

387
00:47:11,271 --> 00:47:16,820
redefining the basic framework for our

388
00:47:14,391 --> 00:47:19,190
defence and deterrence posture we

389
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:22,450
benefited enormously from participating

390
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:26,141
in conferences like this one bringing

391
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:29,000
academics in to give their thoughts on

392
00:47:26,141 --> 00:47:30,471
the balance between reinforcement and

393
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:33,681
forward presence and different options

394
00:47:30,471 --> 00:47:34,910
for for addressing the problem at the

395
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:36,381
end of the day the Alliance has to make

396
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,819
its own decisions based on resource

397
00:47:36,381 --> 00:47:39,681
constraints and political constraints

398
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,200
what the traffic will bear an academic

399
00:47:39,681 --> 00:47:45,351
group can think a little bit more boldly

400
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,819
and hopefully at least push the Alliance

401
00:47:45,351 --> 00:47:48,561
to be more ambitious than it might

402
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:51,530
otherwise be as a consensus based

403
00:47:48,561 --> 00:47:52,940
organization if I'm reinforced both my

404
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:54,620
colleagues I think there was an

405
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:57,471
essential message that's been missed in

406
00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:00,859
the media frankly about the meeting as

407
00:47:57,471 --> 00:48:04,030
it's known this week every single Ally

408
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:06,291
agrees something more must now be done

409
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:07,761
you know I've written reports like this

410
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:10,190
in the past where the political winds

411
00:48:07,761 --> 00:48:12,921
were against it my sense is the

412
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:15,620
political winds are now for ideas the

413
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:17,511
Alliance is open to ideas this is not a

414
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:20,660
new strategic concept for the Alliance

415
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:23,360
but we're now embarked in serious

416
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:25,790
questions about how do we reorganize if

417
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:27,740
we are to generate more funding 100

418
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:29,050
billion extra a year that would come

419
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,169
from 2% from all the

420
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:34,359
how do we spend that properly these are

421
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:36,640
the real meaty questions the Alliance is

422
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:39,310
now grappling with which choose this

423
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,529
week's meeting confirmed so I think we

424
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:43,210
should be recognized we have a positive

425
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:44,580
opportunity to help influence and that's

426
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:54,910
what this entire projects about

427
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:55,810
influence at a key moment yes sir hi

428
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:58,450
Matt Asiata

429
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:01,090
radio and television Slovakia and you

430
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:03,160
may not you may have heard presidents

431
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:06,850
love slog republic yesterday he said the

432
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:11,700
nato is not just fire power pool which

433
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:11,700
is used together to whatever it's also a

434
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:18,279
situational values and democratic values

435
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:22,300
to have to be persistent in that

436
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:26,710
institution to to make nato be able to

437
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:28,780
act when it's needed so uh is your

438
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:31,210
report assessing somehow those

439
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,609
challenges inside challenges of nato

440
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:36,430
community for example and i be very

441
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:39,490
specific some of the member states or

442
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:41,379
people in a nato it's it's not said

443
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:43,660
openly but people in a to think that

444
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:46,170
turkey would not make it made it to nato

445
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:49,960
today if they would apply today

446
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:52,720
considering their state of democratic

447
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,450
principles in in turkey so my question

448
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,549
would be are you assessing those

449
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:01,000
challenges as well and what are the what

450
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:02,830
are the suggestions I can say with high

451
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,580
confidence that we're not going to do a

452
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:08,020
diagnosed diagnosis of each country's

453
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:11,580
political posture I think what we will

454
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:14,890
talk about though is just as you said

455
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:16,299
one of the great strengths of NATO isn't

456
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:18,069
its military strength that a court

457
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,689
that's the obvious outcome but one of

458
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:22,660
the great strengths of NATO is the

459
00:50:19,689 --> 00:50:24,670
Solidarity of the membership and those

460
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:27,549
things which ultimately can erode that

461
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:30,220
solidarity when NATO members for example

462
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:32,800
began to fall away from commitments to

463
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,839
human rights or to democratic values of

464
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,819
democratic principles those are those

465
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,979
are things that we will address in the

466
00:50:36,819 --> 00:50:40,750
paper whether we pin the rose on a

467
00:50:38,979 --> 00:50:41,979
particular political system within a

468
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:42,470
particular country I don't think we're

469
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:44,739
going to go the

470
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,689
but I think we all have to be agreed

471
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:50,750
that NATO as an entity relies on

472
00:50:47,689 --> 00:50:54,009
political stability which is adherence

473
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:56,870
to and faithfulness to the principles of

474
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:59,149
the Washington treaty which have made us

475
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,770
strong to this point I think all of us

476
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:03,259
are concerned that there are there has

477
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:06,920
been a drift in the political

478
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:08,569
environment in Europe of late it's a

479
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:10,670
it's a drift that comes from many

480
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:14,060
reasons it's a drift that has come from

481
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:15,830
external interference in the democratic

482
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,590
principles and democratic institutions

483
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:20,299
both in terms of implement influence

484
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:22,430
operations and information operations

485
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:24,920
cyber intrusion it's a drift that has

486
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:28,250
come from mass migration that has caused

487
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:30,620
real concerns over massive changes

488
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,260
socially in individual states which has

489
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:37,540
driven politics towards nativist or

490
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:40,880
populist directions it's it's adrift in

491
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:43,160
in the in the nature of how people react

492
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:45,500
to economic trauma and economic crises

493
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,970
as well so there are many forces that

494
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,040
are at work and I think it's important

495
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,620
for us to talk about what those forces

496
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,630
are and how they may be impacting the

497
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:56,359
institutions and the nations of NATO but

498
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,770
I don't want this report to do is to

499
00:51:56,359 --> 00:51:59,390
start pinning the rows on people and

500
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:00,950
making judgments about an individual

501
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,330
country but I think it's important that

502
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:03,950
we all have the willingness to talk

503
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,870
about that then in closed-door sessions

504
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:09,830
if we need to have a confrontation then

505
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:12,350
we do it that way have anybody else just

506
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:14,359
add I agree with all of that I think

507
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:17,210
someone said at one of the sessions

508
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:19,340
yesterday that the shared values of

509
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:21,470
democracy freedom liberty the rule of

510
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:24,620
law are what represent NATO's center of

511
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:27,080
gravity I think that remains true today

512
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:30,200
it was our success with native

513
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:32,540
enlargement and extending the area where

514
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:34,310
these values are accepted and have

515
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:36,590
become deeply rooted now through

516
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:39,500
institutional and other reforms that has

517
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:40,939
been such a success story for the

518
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,359
Alliance and for the European Union as

519
00:52:40,939 --> 00:52:46,220
well the process you went hand in hand

520
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:47,810
those values I think are being

521
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:51,259
challenged not only in certain countries

522
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:54,049
but I think across Europe because of the

523
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:55,290
rise of populism and the alienation of

524
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:59,150
some members

525
00:52:55,290 --> 00:53:02,310
population which if not addressed could

526
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:05,250
undermine the this foundation that is so

527
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:08,730
essential to the Alliance's capabilities

528
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:10,140
so it underscores why a strong European

529
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:11,610
Union is important for NATO it's also

530
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:13,980
important for the United States absolute

531
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:16,200
I hope that President Trump's visit to

532
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:18,620
both sides of Brussels will convince him

533
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:21,689
of that fact that he needs a strong

534
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:23,250
Europe strong European Union as part of

535
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:26,220
having a strong transatlantic alliance

536
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:28,470
as the the sole European on this panel

537
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:30,540
with respect to my colleague here I

538
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:32,790
would suggest that drift isn't confined

539
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:35,880
to Europe alone in the recent in recent

540
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:39,720
months but on Turkey I'd say this it's

541
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,970
very easy to have profound concerns

542
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:44,430
what's happening in Turkey but look at

543
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:47,310
Turkey strategic environment look how

544
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:50,190
important turkey is to European security

545
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:52,950
and wider security and the Alliance is a

546
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:54,750
very important forum for all of us to

547
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:57,419
understand the profound concerns that

548
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,920
anchor legitimately has about security

549
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,860
in its region and the Alliance will

550
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,030
continue to perform that function thank

551
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,040
you very much gentlemen

552
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:07,470
I would like to give floor for one of

553
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,460
the last questions maybe the last one if

554
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:16,470
it's a quick one anyone interested yeah

555
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:21,510
sir the gentleman Oh about the matter

556
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:23,189
RVT s I would like to ask uh you

557
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:25,940
mentioned that there is a increased

558
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:28,590
political will to accept the new ideas

559
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:31,170
isn't that just a sign of confusion in

560
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:39,330
dealing with upcoming challenges when it

561
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:44,000
comes to I mean challenges in in the IT

562
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:47,340
sector and technological advancement uh

563
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,080
when it comes to the new report how long

564
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,730
do you think it will be relevant because

565
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,819
it's hard to predict how will the

566
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:56,160
situation's change in upcoming years

567
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:58,470
will we not need a new report every

568
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:59,939
several months yeah how long do you

569
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:02,129
think the report

570
00:54:59,939 --> 00:55:05,310
thank you that's a great question I

571
00:55:02,129 --> 00:55:08,189
think the way I would answer that we

572
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:09,929
have a saying at least in the United

573
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:13,288
States and it's relevant to everybody

574
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:16,919
and that is you are what you buy and if

575
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:20,429
the the processes by which you identify

576
00:55:16,919 --> 00:55:23,908
the requirements locks you into a

577
00:55:20,429 --> 00:55:26,719
certain capability that also then limits

578
00:55:23,909 --> 00:55:29,069
your adaptability it limits your agility

579
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:31,619
so we got to be very careful about it so

580
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:33,839
the answer to your question is we be

581
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:36,209
reissuing this report every week if it

582
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:37,739
was only about change one of the things

583
00:55:36,209 --> 00:55:39,989
that we're proposing in the report is

584
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:42,899
that the process of thinking about the

585
00:55:39,989 --> 00:55:45,390
environment the process ultimately of

586
00:55:42,899 --> 00:55:48,689
developing the requirements necessary

587
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:52,679
for our forces and that they the process

588
00:55:48,689 --> 00:55:55,919
be based on capabilities not based on

589
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:58,199
pure aspirations to possess certain

590
00:55:55,919 --> 00:56:00,089
kinds of equipment because you get it

591
00:55:58,199 --> 00:56:02,579
you get locked into a piece of equipment

592
00:56:00,089 --> 00:56:05,699
that may in - your question may be

593
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:07,649
irrelevant or makes you obsolete very

594
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:09,569
very quickly so it's what's important

595
00:56:07,649 --> 00:56:11,489
for NATO is not just that it is

596
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:14,479
militarily relevant at any given moment

597
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:17,759
but that NATO is intellectually and

598
00:56:14,479 --> 00:56:20,640
procedurally sufficiently agile that we

599
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:23,810
can perceive the environment we can from

600
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:28,199
that perception of the environment apply

601
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:29,939
relevant and time tried processes for

602
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:32,669
requirements development that delivers

603
00:56:29,939 --> 00:56:34,678
us the capability that we need not

604
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:37,770
necessarily the equipment that we want

605
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:39,060
and that's that's frankly the rub that

606
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,339
may be one of the greatest challenges

607
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,899
that NATO faces in the future I think we

608
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:45,089
can all understand the Russian challenge

609
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:47,159
we can understand the southern challenge

610
00:56:45,089 --> 00:56:49,828
I want to diminish them at all but if

611
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:52,679
NATO's internal processes for for

612
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:54,359
perceiving the environment reacting to

613
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:57,270
the environment and the procedural

614
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:59,339
processes are not sufficiently agile or

615
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:02,489
deliver us in the end something that we

616
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:04,350
need versus something that we want the

617
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:06,649
NATO can quickly find themselves in this

618
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:09,509
gallop of technology locked into

619
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:10,859
capabilities that are irrelevant that's

620
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,660
really the challenge for us is to

621
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:14,670
propose processes

622
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:16,740
that keep us agile not a particular

623
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:19,830
equipment set that keeps us agile

624
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:22,649
tonight that initiative isn't just one

625
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:25,020
report it's part of a suite of reports

626
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:27,480
that you can pick up written by leading

627
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:30,061
experts and practitioners so it covers a

628
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,250
very very large and broad remit and

629
00:57:30,061 --> 00:57:32,760
broad set of subjects you know I'm an

630
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,800
academic

631
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,260
I've worked do I work for government and

632
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:39,240
I work for you EU and NATO I know what

633
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:41,820
it's like inside these institutions the

634
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:43,979
coalface is what dictates everyday

635
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:46,800
normally getting through avoiding crises

636
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:49,320
political upsets ensuring momentum on

637
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:52,320
the issues of the day there's a real

638
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:55,891
value on a senior group of experts and

639
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:58,080
practitioners standing back at a moment

640
00:57:55,891 --> 00:58:00,650
of friction where there's a whole array

641
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:02,549
of threats risk challenges and

642
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:04,200
opportunities that not forget this we

643
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:06,000
talk we tend to get into a very negative

644
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,779
mindset but there's opportunities for

645
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,490
this alliance in in this century my

646
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:14,480
sense is the ideas we've put together

647
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:17,490
the way we've put these ideas together

648
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:20,790
the idea of a thinking alliance that can

649
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:23,250
adapt its mindset to the challenges of

650
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:25,529
the 21st century these are vital

651
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,700
constructs that we have to offer so in

652
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:28,891
it says when I was a teaching

653
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:31,799
undergraduates many years ago teach them

654
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:33,660
what to think when I was teaching post

655
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,510
graduates I would teach them how to

656
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:39,779
think and what we're humbling putting

657
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:41,190
forward is a way of thinking about these

658
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,980
threats challenges risks and

659
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,840
opportunities so that we have a

660
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:48,510
comprehensive understanding of how we

661
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:50,880
engage them and thereafter how we can be

662
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:53,311
efficient and effective in the

663
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,410
governance of those challenges and it

664
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:58,050
strikes me this is exactly the moment

665
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:03,509
for this kind of contribution to our

666
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:06,570
dynamic alliance just as one phrase in

667
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:09,840
the report which I think explains how

668
00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:11,340
we're trying to future-proof the

669
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:14,430
alliance which obviously you can't

670
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:15,811
predict every threat or scenario they

671
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:17,819
may develop it if you create the

672
00:59:15,811 --> 00:59:19,980
capabilities the rapid decision-making

673
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:21,570
the command and control the intelligence

674
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:22,740
structures that could support rapid

675
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:24,870
decision-making to deal with anything

676
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,339
that comes along then you're getting at

677
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:28,439
least close to future proofing the

678
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:30,600
so we hope our report will help get

679
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:33,060
closer to that goal and in the fall

680
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,709
we'll hold another meeting here not a

681
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,989
conference but another meeting here

682
00:59:34,709 --> 00:59:39,689
where we're going to invite industry to

683
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:41,669
come in for a very detailed conversation

684
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:43,649
about requirements development and

685
00:59:41,669 --> 00:59:45,959
capability needs of NATO in the future

686
00:59:43,649 --> 00:59:48,149
so that we are listening to industry as

687
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:51,029
well the defence industry has an

688
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:52,890
enormous role to play in keeping NATO

689
00:59:51,029 --> 00:59:54,539
competitive against all the many

690
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:57,029
challenges that it has and I think we

691
00:59:54,539 --> 00:59:59,159
need to bring them in to provide us

692
00:59:57,029 --> 01:00:00,689
their view as well so when the general

693
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:04,799
says in the fall to translate he means

694
01:00:00,689 --> 01:00:08,939
autumn thank you for my bird translating

695
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:10,919
by Virginian is amend - okay well thank

696
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:12,270
you very much for this morning and we'll

697
01:00:10,919 --> 01:00:14,100
turn it over to our moderator one last

698
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:16,589
statement from your professor yeah I

699
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:18,810
just want to make a comment about under

700
01:00:16,589 --> 01:00:20,489
you we Europeans is a European statement

701
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:22,078
from a European understanding where the

702
01:00:20,489 --> 01:00:25,079
u.s. is right now I was in Washington

703
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,239
with John recently don't think the

704
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:30,329
pressure from President Trump is just

705
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:32,909
about the Trump administration speaking

706
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:35,640
to Democrats in Washington as well on

707
01:00:32,909 --> 01:00:38,249
both sides of the aisle it's very clear

708
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,319
the we Europeans are going to have to

709
01:00:38,249 --> 01:00:42,509
step up to the plate to assist the

710
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:45,869
United States in a whole range of ways

711
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:47,850
if we are to keep this alliance dynamic

712
01:00:45,869 --> 01:00:49,709
the choice is ours and I suppose the

713
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:52,140
ultimate question for we Europeans is

714
01:00:49,709 --> 01:00:54,118
how much do we want this alliance well

715
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:55,439
now's the time for that question thank

716
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:57,390

717

you

724

United States Senator for Wisconsin and

725
01:45:33,479 --> 01:45:38,640
a member of the Republican Party senator

726
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,990
Johnson serves as chairman of the

727
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,270
Homeland Security and Governmental

728
01:45:39,990 --> 01:45:44,010
Affairs Committee and he's also the

729
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:46,500
chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe

730
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:48,090
and regional security cooperation so I'm

731
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:51,930
happy now to turn this over to Senator

732
01:45:48,090 --> 01:45:53,970
Johnson Thank You Stephanie and thanks

733
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:56,580
for coming here just brief opening

734
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:59,160
statement you know the reason I came to

735
01:45:56,580 --> 01:46:02,280
globe SEC really two reasons first of

736
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:04,439
all to listen had number of very good

737
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:07,320
meetings with a number of foreign

738
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:10,859
ministers and President Croatia for

739
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:12,660
example and as chairman the Subcommittee

740
01:46:10,859 --> 01:46:14,250
on European affairs of Senate Foreign

741
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:16,410
Relations Committee certainly part of my

742
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:17,609
responsibility but that chairmanship

743
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:19,050
dovetails very nicely with my

744
01:46:17,609 --> 01:46:22,260
chairmanship of Homeland Security

745
01:46:19,050 --> 01:46:25,649
governmental affairs and so I think it's

746
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:27,359
important that our European partners see

747
01:46:25,649 --> 01:46:29,820
members of Congress members the Senate

748
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:32,040
coming into Europe certainly providing

749
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:34,679
the reassurance that we believe that our

750
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:36,450
NATO alliance is crucial it's important

751
01:46:34,680 --> 01:46:38,700
we want to do everything we can

752
01:46:36,450 --> 01:46:41,040
strengthen it send that message but also

753
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:43,170
I relationship with all the countries of

754
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:45,450
Europe we want to strengthen them that's

755
01:46:43,170 --> 01:46:46,979
really we are the bulwark to provide

756
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:49,050
peace and stability throughout the world

757
01:46:46,979 --> 01:46:51,390
so that's why I'm here to basically

758
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:52,920
provide that reassurance and listen and

759
01:46:51,390 --> 01:46:54,450
learn so we can strengthen those

760
01:46:52,920 --> 01:47:02,810
relationships with that I'm happy to

761
01:46:54,450 --> 01:47:02,809
answer questions anybody there we go

762
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:12,521
good afternoon senator welcome you just

763
01:47:10,330 --> 01:47:16,660
mentioned that there are no moderates in

764
01:47:12,521 --> 01:47:18,130
Iran but what about Saudi Arabia do you

765
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:19,450
see the southeast as what rates in the

766
01:47:18,130 --> 01:47:21,790
region well first of all there's

767
01:47:19,450 --> 01:47:23,260
certainly moderates in Iran not what I

768
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:26,170
would consider moderates in the

769
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:28,720
governing coalition right now or within

770
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:31,150
the government leadership correct yeah

771
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:34,120
listen I think the new Crown Prince

772
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:36,490
within Saudi Arabia is making some

773
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:38,590
pretty important steps to modernize to

774
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:41,891
open up the society which is which is

775
01:47:38,590 --> 01:47:44,710
good thing and you know I believe from

776
01:47:41,891 --> 01:47:47,799
the last eight years where our friends

777
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:51,220
were not supported to the extent they

778
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:53,860
should have and we went out of our way

779
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:55,630
to support potential enemies it was not

780
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:56,920
the proper direction so under the new

781
01:47:55,630 --> 01:48:00,160
administration we're going to recognize

782
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:01,780
that the Sunni Arab Gulf states people

783
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:03,190
that actually want to provide peace of

784
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:05,440
stability in the region in the world

785
01:48:03,190 --> 01:48:06,759
they have the State of Israel I think

786
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:12,150
that's the better approach the Middle

787
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:12,150
East thank you

788
01:48:16,679 --> 01:48:26,309
other questions anyone if not appreciate

789
01:48:24,099 --> 01:48:26,309
your time

790
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:24,609
you
