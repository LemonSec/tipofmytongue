1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
and less like NATO and I you know I've

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,470
heard that myself and I know you have

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,719
too and I'm wondering whether that links

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,400
up with what the general things tell us

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,790
what how these kinds of recommendations

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,710
in these issues from the inside uh

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,599
what's the discussion like and where are

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,150
we moving well first of all I want to

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,279
thank General Allen and his study team

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,278
for coming to NATO last month we had a

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,710
really good discussion about the report

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,439
about where they were heading and I

13
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,690
think it really is going to be a very

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,910
important continuing driver for

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,349
discussion but I want to say a lot of

16
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,148
the issues that have been raised have

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,790
been from Center at NATO now for some

18
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,719
time let's take this matter of how we

19
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,769
speed up the acquisition and

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,920
incorporation of technology new

21
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:54,590
technology into how NATO does business

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,750
and into how NATO and its partners

23
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:00,300
engage whether in the worst case in

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,760
combat or in just ensuring that we are

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,289
able to fight terrorism effectively do

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,580
everything that NATO is going to be

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,760
doing around the world and the

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,330
recognition is very clear that we have a

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,330
lot to do we just completed actually a

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:18,119
external Advisory Group did some work to

31
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,048
try to think about how to streamline and

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,159
facilitate based on kind of today's

33
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,990
superstructure for decision-making on

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,939
procurement on acquisitions in in NATO

35
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,810
frankly they have some very very good

36
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:33,059
ideas but it's going to be a bit of a

37
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,220
barrier to get up and over to to change

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,170
how NATO does business in these areas

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,360
but I think the recognition of the

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,790
problem is there that's always the first

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,409
step on the road to fixing whatever

42
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:49,110
problem you've got but I think it's very

43
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,259
welcome to have from the globe SEC Study

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,780
Group this this very very astute but

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,640
also well formulated list of drivers

46
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,920
because it will really help to shape

47
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,369
thinking at the headquarters and among

48
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,880
the nations as we're we're contemplating

49
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:08,970
further adaptation of the Alliance mr.

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,530
foreign minister you are sort of on the

51
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,720
front lines of a lot of these questions

52
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:16,470
that along with your

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,109
follow Baltic ministers and governments

54
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:23,430
a couple of years ago you talked about

55
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,710
how nervous you were this was a common

56
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,200
theme from from folks in your region

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,240
have the kinds of conversations that

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,730
General Allen and that Rose discussing

59
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,970
they're going inside on inside that NATO

60
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,530
and Brussels have these reassured you at

61
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,090
all is the kind of stuff that NATO is

62
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,130
doing the kind of steps that are

63
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,040
undertaking to adapt to the new

64
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,810
environment make you less nervous are

65
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,579
you still very nervous tell us how

66
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,520
you're feeling how does it look from

67
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:56,370
Lithuania good morning everyone

68
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:59,190
very good pretty good to be back and

69
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,290
NATO is the strongest alliance in the

70
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,720
world history and still it is in spite

71
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,579
of everything but let me start by also

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,400
paying tribute to speak Brzezinski by

73
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,120
hew few sentences he was not only

74
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,210
stategies great statesman friend of

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Baltic states really proud to know him

76
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:22,080
but will also may be many knows many

77
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,120
know the passion hunter and during

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,880
hunting once in Lithuania he shot two

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:36,840
boars and called them Molotov and

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:40,049
Ribbentrop it's good to remember because

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,269
good Rebecca in my in my view you know

82
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:48,810
the motive still alive you know and

83
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:50,910
looking for his Ribbentrop so that's for

84
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,580
the beginning and then when it comes to

85
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,010
the adaptation and what was just

86
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,570
presented all these priorities I

87
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:00,440
probably have to say a few words about

88
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,640
Oh particular our region of course and

89
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,890
definitely this has to do with very

90
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,000
simple things - the one hand simple and

91
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,760
on the other hand quite complicated

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,670
because we have to address capability

93
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,799
gaps which is really obvious and it's

94
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,229
not done for one night it's all much

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,150
done in short term but has to be done

96
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,980
and it's being done as we speak by the

97
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,478
way and have in minds very concrete

98
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,640
things like your defence capabilities

99
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:25,590
for simple presence also when we're

100
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,380
talking how to deny the

101
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,630
well let's put it bluntly Russian access

102
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,690
denial it's it's important but the best

103
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,340
denial is presence of hours so that's

104
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:38,610
that's the best in Thailand also we have

105
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,219
to take into account account also also

106
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,020
what we would like to see frankly it's

107
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,419
started we started to discussions in

108
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,400
Wales in war so to speed up

109
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,020
decision-making process again it's easy

110
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,359
to say but you know complicated

111
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,669
machinery and many lies consensus

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,210
building process needs time which is the

113
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,729
respect but we have to do much more in

114
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,799
order to make this really happening in

115
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:03,450
more speedy way because crisis not

116
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,180
waiting you know we have to be active

117
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,880
and therefore it's related and I'm see

118
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,729
good group of military authorities

119
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,620
former current there should be given

120
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,389
more authority I understand that the

121
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,270
last time when they had to almost a

122
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:20,280
limited Authority then it was of course

123
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,320
the political supervision is important

124
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,599
but they have to be given more authority

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,760
not to put a political decisions when

126
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,690
crisis comes and that's also also the

127
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,130
case a talk about our region it was some

128
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,469
time when we discussed do we need

129
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,919
defense plans do we not you know that

130
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,330
was the case and this gradual response

131
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,390
plans are important but we should have

132
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,840
standing defence plans with attributed

133
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:48,270
troops which which also nothing special

134
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,020
basically but this is a must we we can

135
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:55,229
do and again I'm saying this given this

136
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,270
propaganda noise surround when our

137
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:59,639
friends Russians they are very gifted to

138
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,440
swap sites sometimes then accuse others

139
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,750
what they doing themselves because

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,760
nowadays saying that taking response

141
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,100
measures what NATO is doing which is

142
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,740
really those who are not even experts

143
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,289
it's by far nothing to compete to

144
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,169
compare numbers of troops generation of

145
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,190
forces number of exercises that

146
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:19,560
exercises or whatever it's nothing to

147
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,510
compare and while saying that NATO is

148
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,760
not going to compete or escalator which

149
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:25,590
is not our task and go but no one should

150
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,260
doubt that we will do everything what is

151
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,270
necessary to protect our territories

152
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,150
populations and our countries and that's

153
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,580
that's really a now as we speak this is

154
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,560
really not just momentum at the time a

155
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,300
very crucial decisis if I would stay and

156
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,770
I would in brief would say this this

157
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,500
would be tasks of the Alliance in

158
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,450
particular in our region you know

159
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,430
oftentimes my talk about NATO's present

160
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:50,320
NATO future you know it's it's sort of

161
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,610
30,000 feet it's very abstract question

162
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,310
we're lucky that this week it's very

163
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:55,540
much on the agenda not just your globe

164
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,660
separate of course in Brussels we just

165
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,700
had the summit I want to ask you sort of

166
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,650
ball to to sort of questions related to

167
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,159
this summit and your impressions of it

168
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:08,049
one is we all the people in this room

169
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,730
have have read the news accounts of it

170
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,979
and would know the sort of conventional

171
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,110
wisdom take away from it and I want to

172
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,090
get your response to that and then I

173
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,830
want to find out what are we not hearing

174
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,210
enough about what's going on the

175
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,159
substance of meetings that are happening

176
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,080
that sometimes doesn't break through to

177
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,229
especially my my beloved colleagues in

178
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,930
the media you know we're often chasing

179
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,250
the the shiny objects but let's talk

180
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,720
about those shiny objects for a second

181
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:35,650
because they're particularly shiny right

182
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,570
now I here's what I would say is the

183
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,359
conventional wisdom takeaway from this

184
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,770
week's summit and I I think it's very

185
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,990
well represented by something that

186
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,510
Fareed Zakaria wrote and here's what he

187
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,330
wrote he said if you were to construct a

188
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:51,729
Russian plan for what you would like the

189
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,680
American President to do to undermine

190
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:55,719
NATO it would look something like this

191
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,910
he would go to NATO headquarters and

192
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,910
publicly highlighted visions he would

193
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,979
berate other members and he would refuse

194
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,690
to very clearly affirm America's

195
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:07,090
commitment to article 5 collective

196
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:10,240
defense well president Truong did all

197
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,859
that I'm what that is sort of the

198
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,289
message that that you're getting if you

199
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,910
read the major newspapers and watch the

200
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:18,669
cable news that this is the biggest

201
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,130
story I do I want to get your response

202
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,750
to that idea to that image and then

203
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,789
we'll talk about what's underneath it

204
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,030
let's start with you rose that was an

205
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:29,139
inevitable you'd start with I was just

206
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,848
because you're right next to me that's

207
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:35,469
all for read is always both pungent and

208
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,719
colorful in his commentary and I've

209
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,659
always enjoyed reading it because he

210
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,550
does capture so much in this case though

211
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:44,169
he's a bit off and I actually wanted to

212
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:48,490
talk a little bit about the mood music

213
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:52,089
in the room on Thursday night there's no

214
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:55,269
question that there was some

215
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:57,430
blunt speaking from mr. Trump but what

216
00:08:55,269 --> 00:09:00,040
really struck me and this has not come

217
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,800
out in the press at all with a degree to

218
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,349
which leaders around the room set aside

219
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,599
they're prepared remarks some of them

220
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,639
took some time to jot things down some

221
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,149
of them just spoke directly from here

222
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:16,480
and they talked about the value of the

223
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:20,290
NATO alliance very directly they talked

224
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,870
about its value as basically a bulwark

225
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:26,129
of the principles for which all of our

226
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:29,139
countries stand members and partners

227
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:31,360
always working in that direction talking

228
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:33,160
about the value of both democratic

229
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,689
institutions but also the rule of law

230
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,279
and now you know I have to stop saying I

231
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:40,839
new to this job I've been in the job

232
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,790
eight months so I've seen two

233
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,220
ministerials on the defense side two on

234
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,170
the foreign policy side and this is my

235
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,899
first leaders meeting heads of state

236
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,559
government meeting but among the five

237
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,809
meetings this was the most direct

238
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,670
extemporaneous and I would say heartfelt

239
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,899
discussion that I've heard the meetings

240
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,949
are always useful we get a lot of

241
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,660
business done

242
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,370
you've all sat in on these meetings you

243
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,660
know our business gets done people make

244
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,749
announcements and things they're

245
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:11,290
offering up very useful very important

246
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:12,999
very very I would say necessary for the

247
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,099
continuing engine of the Alliance to

248
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:18,029
keep ticking over and moving the

249
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:20,350
Alliance forward but this was a

250
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:23,199
heartfelt discussion and it was an

251
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,379
important one I think in terms of making

252
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:29,920
it clear that the allies get it they

253
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,600
truly do get it when it comes to having

254
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,959
to pick up their fair share of the

255
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,829
burden and I wanted I actually look back

256
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,109
this morning

257
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:39,489
I too threw away my prepared remarks for

258
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,910
this this morning you'll be relieved to

259
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,490
know but I looked this up this morning

260
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,499
it says the blunt reality is that there

261
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,610
will be dwindling appetite and patience

262
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:50,559
in the US Congress

263
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,019
and in the American body politic writ

264
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,730
large to expend increasingly precious

265
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,860
funds on behalf of nations that are

266
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,529
apparently unwilling to devote necessary

267
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:02,529
resources to be serious and capable

268
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:06,130
partners in our own defense not my words

269
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:08,290
Robert Gates June 2011

270
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,840
his final statement to defense

271
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,630
ministerial of NATO I'm sure many of you

272
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,510
were there so this has been going on for

273
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,689
a long time but the Alliance did have a

274
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:22,830
wake-up call in 2014

275
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:27,150
aggressive action of Russia in Ukraine

276
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:30,550
seizure of Crimea action in the Donbass

277
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:33,400
after that and along with it the rights

278
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:36,189
of ISIL seizure of Mosul so that was a

279
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,920
wake-up call and the Allies are stepping

280
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,720
up so I would say we need to have a

281
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,150
continuing debate there needs to be a

282
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,860
continuing drive the the kinds of

283
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,199
technology developments that General

284
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,660
Allen is raising with his team in his

285
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,610
report are going to take significant

286
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,240
resources so we have to keep our eye on

287
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:58,950
this prize but I wanted to say I found

288
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,150
that discussion on Thursday to be a

289
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,810
heartfelt one I'll use that word again

290
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:07,860
but very direct and the way in the best

291
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,270
of meetings the discussion should go

292
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,370
leanest you basically what I think Rose

293
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,199
is saying is that this is a message that

294
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,270
a president Trump was delivering is one

295
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,550
that has been delivered before perhaps

296
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,949
in a slightly different way but the same

297
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,370
message and I'm wondering from where you

298
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:28,680
sit is the way it's being expressed

299
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:31,240
today more effective less effective I

300
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,160
suggest not to focus on some single

301
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,870
statements or what was said what was not

302
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,130
said because it was even not a standard

303
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,830
to be precise right it was a special

304
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:42,189
meeting so it's not just with who whole

305
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:44,320
spectrum of meetings and the margins of

306
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,730
that as usually in foreign ministers

307
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,730
defence ministers we're engaged so it

308
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,650
was just first encounter so to expect

309
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,110
that everything will be set maybe it

310
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,209
would be not not realistic but also I'd

311
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:58,000
like to say a value very much process

312
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,830
not just statement and when I was asked

313
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,990
the beginning before actions after

314
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,140
elections in United States are we scared

315
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:07,030
how were you so to say confused

316
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,210
whatever frustrated I said look let's

317
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:12,400
let's wait let's be patient let's you

318
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:15,580
know things will settle down and now I

319
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,959
can tell really very bluntly after two

320
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,440
visits the United States after the

321
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,600
elections meeting all key officials

322
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,840
Security Advisor my colleague secretary

323
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,880
Sun speaker Ryan Chairman's of the

324
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,570
competition Congress in in Senate I'm

325
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,610
really short assured hundred-percent and

326
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,890
the meetings were excellent and the

327
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,530
points raised by very to the exactly

328
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:40,080
what we like to see along the lines we

329
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,689
thinking and also let's admit president

330
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,760
of American troops on our soil also is

331
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,220
the fact it's not a statement this

332
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,189
effect in the defense budget rollout and

333
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,320
national budget but also also in

334
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,380
addition more resources for presidency

335
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,970
in Europe so let's look at facts and

336
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,280
also my advice would be let's look at

337
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,170
ourselves are we really doing enough or

338
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,120
just looking who is guilty who is doing

339
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,189
not enough that will be very important

340
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,200
for our alliance for cohesion for

341
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,420
burden-sharing for everything and now

342
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,820
really more easy to talk to me because

343
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,680
my nation was always lagging behind with

344
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,430
the regard of the defense spending not

345
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,709
not anymore

346
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:20,270
so we increases dynamics is the best

347
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,270
among NATO now what let me ask you that

348
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:27,949
you

349
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,220
can be really very powerful you unit

350
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,200
Union it will really work with each

351
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,240
other and these investments what u.s.

352
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,730
does in Europe its investments also for

353
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,250
us sake you know it's really time to

354
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:36,140
make our euro-atlantic alliance great

355
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:37,730
again the promise it just doesn't on a

356
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:43,130
hat you got to get it to fit on a head

357
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:46,429
that's the key no hats let's go ahead

358
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:48,169
well I actually want to pick up on a

359
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:49,970
point that that General Allen made

360
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:52,400
because it was a very important part of

361
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,289
our discussion also on Thursday and that

362
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,730
is the way the Alliance is coming

363
00:19:54,289 --> 00:20:00,890
together in the fight against terrorism

364
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:02,690
now and second likes to say that we have

365
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:07,390
been in the fight against terrorism

366
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:10,070
since well since well 9/11 and the

367
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,590
invocation of Article five and that was

368
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:16,250
front and center again at the the

369
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:18,530
memorial dedication on Thursday I hope

370
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,570
before too long you'll get to our new

371
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:25,070
headquarters to see what both the Berlin

372
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:26,899
Wall and 9/11 and article 5 memorial

373
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:30,710
look like because they're in a

374
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:33,799
magnificent setting and and really speak

375
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,929
both to the challenges of overcoming the

376
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,750
Soviet Union and ending the Cold War and

377
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:43,130
our approach today which is to continue

378
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:45,559
to defend and to have a strong

379
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:49,070
deterrence relationship to defend

380
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:52,730
against potential aggression but also to

381
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,710
begin to redouble our efforts in the

382
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,450
fight against terrorism and that's the

383
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:01,039
meaning of this action plan that we put

384
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,780
together and that is is now something

385
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,260
that all of the Allied leaders agree

386
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:09,470
they agreed to reports on Thursday one

387
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,390
was on counterterrorism the other was

388
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,490
with regard to defense burden-sharing

389
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,700
and redoubling reemphasize

390
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,460
the necessity of fulfilling and

391
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:23,299
implementing the defence investment

392
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:25,520
pledge from Wales 2014 so those are both

393
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:28,040
now firmly agreed there are in both

394
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,190
cases plans that will be fulfilled to

395
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,810
move forward individual

396
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,940
plans on the defense burden for cheering

397
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,710
side and on the other side then of

398
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,250
course together we are working on the

399
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:40,200
counterterrorism struggles honestly and

400
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,630
it is going to be a generational

401
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,370
struggle for everyone in this room

402
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,280
younger people those with the green

403
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:50,250
halyards on and those of us who are

404
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,840
further along in our lives let me just

405
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:56,040
make a comment though I wanted to open

406
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:00,540
up a little bit also about this notion

407
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:02,760
of counterterrorism Trump's Russia isn't

408
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,820
that interesting how that verb gets used

409
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,440
now in the English language but

410
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,540
everybody considers it so delicious they

411
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,400
have to use it all the time but but it

412
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,740
is part of the debate that's been

413
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,960
swirling around is there too much now on

414
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,190
the fight against terrorism and are we

415
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:22,560
forgetting our defence and deterrence

416
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,540
requirements and challenges and I just

417
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,940
wanted to again take us back to dinner

418
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:29,490
on Thursday and I wanted to give you a

419
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,010
feel for the richness of the discussion

420
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:34,740
around Russia and the challenges that

421
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,230
Russia poses and the fact that we still

422
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,290
have major challenges in dealing with

423
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:42,270
the situation in Georgia in Ukraine now

424
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:43,770
the Western Balkans taking more

425
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,840
front-and-center we're all concerned

426
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:48,180
about what's going on there there was a

427
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,129
real seriousness to that discussion and

428
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,500
I wanted to assure you all anybody who's

429
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,200
been concerned about this matter that in

430
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,630
fact there was a strong recommitment to

431
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,060
the Warsaw decisions with regard to our

432
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:03,690
dual-track approach deterrence and

433
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,520
defense and dialogue with Russia it was

434
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,380
a strong discussion it was a rich

435
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,050
discussion and it was a very good

436
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,260
discussion so I would say now we have

437
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:16,139
two major balls to juggle I mean always

438
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:18,840
there they're significant challenges

439
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,150
ahead of this alliance but we can engage

440
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,939
fully and strongly in the fight against

441
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,490
terrorism do it in a more comprehensive

442
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:30,480
way than we have done in the past but

443
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:34,140
also confront the challenges to defence

444
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,290
and deterrence that a more aggressive

445
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,850
Russia poses to the Alliance you know

446
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,610
one form of adaptation we haven't

447
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,020
discussed rows yet is enlargement and

448
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:46,469
you just mentioned you

449
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,170
in Georgia I'd love to hear your

450
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,640
thoughts on where does that issue Center

451
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,040
those just completely off the table now

452
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,059
given the realities is it was that part

453
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,080
of the discussion was that stuff

454
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,059
something you were hearing about oh

455
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,000
absolutely and let me just say a word

456
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:03,629
about this Twitter storm you know

457
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,640
honestly we are missing an historic

458
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,790
moment by getting wrapped up in this

459
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,800
Twitter storm over the Montenegrin prime

460
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:16,440
ministers encounter with Miss mr. Trump

461
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:20,580
on Thursday Montenegro was welcomed as

462
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:23,250
an incoming ally to NATO we can't yet

463
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,320
raise its flag but it was welcomed as an

464
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,929
incoming Ally for the first time the

465
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,280
Prime Minister addressed the heads of

466
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:32,460
state and government in a leaders

467
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,840
meeting and it was greeted twice with an

468
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,340
extemporaneous spontaneous eruption of

469
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,129
applause once during the handover

470
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,709
ceremony and once after we heard the

471
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:47,760
Prime Minister at that table the leaders

472
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:50,280
all gave a very strong round of applause

473
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,860
and I just wanted to underscore that

474
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,530
because this is a country that has

475
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,990
really really had to do some heavy

476
00:24:55,530 --> 00:25:00,870
lifting they had really serious and

477
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:03,630
difficult problems of corruption they

478
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:05,459
had to pull a reform program across the

479
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:09,660
finish line to be ready for NATO

480
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:11,820
membership they did that and then as it

481
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,559
was coming to the finish line almost the

482
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,800
end of the day last fall there was a

483
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,980
serious coup attempt to try to derail

484
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,290
the whole process so this country has

485
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,990
done so much to deserve NATO membership

486
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:27,750
and I think we're missing this historic

487
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:30,120
moment through you know all of the

488
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:32,400
brouhaha that has surrounded what

489
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,590
happened on Thursday so I just want to

490
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,470
say to this audience I hope when their

491
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,540
flag is raised over NATO on the 7th of

492
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:44,270
June that you'll help us celebrate

493
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,270
it's an historic moment it truly is

494
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:51,830
and yes we did talk about what else

495
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,229
needs to be done there are other

496
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:58,610
countries in the Western Balkans Bosnia

497
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:01,880
and Herzegovina former Yugoslavia public

498
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:04,070
of Macedonia there are you know efforts

499
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,650
of foot to work with them as well they

500
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,179
clearly clearly have a lot of problems

501
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:10,190
these days they need to look at what

502
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,960
they need to do to complete some

503
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:15,470
political process to complete some

504
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,990
reform processes we will continue to

505
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,220
work with them and I wanted to say two

506
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,690
things about this matter

507
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:25,430
first of all countries whoever they are

508
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:28,040
Ukraine Georgia the countries of the

509
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,930
Western Balkans they must have the right

510
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,960
to choose their security relationships

511
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:35,870
for themselves this is a basic principle

512
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,020
upon which NATO operates and we must

513
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:41,780
continue to press that matter it doesn't

514
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,910
mean that they need to be only working

515
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,160
you know in one direction we have no

516
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,660
problem if a country is working with

517
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,050
Moscow and working with the NATO

518
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:53,300
alliance if that's their choice so be it

519
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,889
but they must have the right and the

520
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,710
ability to choose their security

521
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,300
relationships for themselves the second

522
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,940
point I really wanted to stress is that

523
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:04,430
NATO's door will remain open and that is

524
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:07,490
affirm both principle and policy for the

525
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:09,230
Alliance general just then the

526
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,600
partnership process is also very helpful

527
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:13,160
yeah thank you for real because it it

528
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,490
helps to prepare states that are

529
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,320
interested it creates a very visible and

530
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,760
tangible relationship between NATO and

531
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,409
other states as well so it's not just

532
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,230
membership enlargement it's also the

533
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,270
Partnership Program let me stay with you

534
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,380
a general I wanted to ask you Rose

535
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,200
brought up this issue of how do you

536
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:33,590
balance priorities between the UN you

537
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,450
talked about these driving factors well

538
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,860
the threat from the east and then you

539
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,630
described it as the threat from the

540
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,370
south and an internal threat this was

541
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,560
the kind of issue of terrorism failing

542
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:46,100
States and and and refugee flows then

543
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,950
and then Salafi jihadis arrived from

544
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:52,669
inside Europe what's your read of how

545
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:55,010
the organization has balanced those two

546
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,250
priorities and how would you tweak it if

547
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:59,590
it were up to you

548
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:02,680
I'm not sure I can comment specifically

549
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,059
on how I'd tweak this I'm not dodging

550
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,820
the question but I would simply say that

551
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:09,040
NATO is in the process of adapting first

552
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:12,010
first thing of course is that I think

553
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:15,010
NATO very well acknowledged the

554
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:17,710
challenge last year in Warsaw and set

555
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,720
for all of us who either observe NATO or

556
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,000
participate in NATO set for us the tasks

557
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,860
necessary to do this but I think in ways

558
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,960
we've never seen before we have a

559
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:31,090
confluence of challenges and threats

560
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,550
that require for us require us to think

561
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:37,449
differently for example we do know that

562
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:40,928
Russia has engaged in an active program

563
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:44,080
of influence does end formats Elon Musk

564
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:47,950
Iruka and other activities along with

565
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,649
cyber intrusion cyber attacks that are

566
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,929
that have specifically targeted the

567
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,390
democratic institutions of states in

568
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:57,309
Western Europe so that that in some

569
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,830
respect is about weakening the

570
00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:02,230
institutions and the capacity of those

571
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:04,540
states to be resilient so that's that

572
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:07,420
that is one line that's moving across

573
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,059
the interior of NATO in Western Europe

574
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:13,059
the second is the fact that Russia is

575
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:16,720
engaged in the South in an environment

576
00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:19,750
where we seem it is not foreseeable

577
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,580
right now that the that one of the four

578
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,380
civil wars in the region in which Russia

579
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,120
is actively engaged in fighting whether

580
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,070
we'll ever see a resolution to that in

581
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,229
the near future but what we can

582
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:29,860
anticipate as if this continues to

583
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,410
deteriorate

584
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:36,428
there will be more waves of migrants

585
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:39,390
coming to Europe another line directed

586
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:42,880
towards Europe as the migration of

587
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:44,920
millions of people threaten the to

588
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,860
fundamentally change the social fabric

589
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,590
of Europe and then we have the another

590
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:54,520
line which is converging in Europe which

591
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:56,678
is the line explicitly of the so-called

592
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,570
Islamic state and other terrorists who

593
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,580
are attacking in the heartland now

594
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:03,669
perhaps to relieve the pressure on the

595
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:06,280
core area in Syria and Iraq but perhaps

596
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,820
just simply because they believe they

597
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:11,889
have the capacity today

598
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:15,668
weakened institutions large migration

599
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:17,830
flows enhanced terrorist activity along

600
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:20,830
terrorists and criminal networks these

601
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,899
are all converging lines into Europe in

602
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,580
ways we've not seen before and I really

603
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:27,100
think the third is going to become a

604
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,109
more prominent line as time goes on so

605
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,149
are we in NATO and this is just a

606
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:33,340
rhetorical question it's not intended to

607
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:36,189
be critical in any way are we and NATO

608
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,158
seeing the convergence of those lines in

609
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:41,350
a coherent way that can drive us in

610
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,570
terms of our decision-making process in

611
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,570
terms of our willingness to work closely

612
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:48,279
with the EU and other states to share

613
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,950
intelligence to share information to

614
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:52,960
support law enforcement to have special

615
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,970
operations capabilities poised and ready

616
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,489
to go to help a nation that is

617
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,169
struggling at a moment of crisis are we

618
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:02,529
thinking in those terms and I think in

619
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:04,389
terms of agility and adaptation for the

620
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:07,119
realities of what we face in the future

621
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:08,678
just that alone those three converging

622
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,988
lines from the east and from the south

623
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,539
and from the inside are ways that we

624
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:15,609
should be thinking mr. Minister when you

625
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:17,919
hear discussions like this of balancing

626
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:19,418
the priorities I'm assuming you know

627
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,970
perhaps wrongly you correct me if I'm

628
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:24,009
wrong about this that in your country

629
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:25,539
the focus is primarily on this threat

630
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,789
from the east that the idea that NATO

631
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:30,009
should be focused on Russia and all the

632
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:33,580
kinds of things that General Allen has

633
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:35,379
just mentioned how what's your read of

634
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,470
whether the organization's priorities

635
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:40,570
are in line with the reality of the

636
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,059
threat no it should address all threats

637
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,340
southeast and three you using this term

638
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:47,889
360 degrees which is not just for fun

639
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,928
but it's really true we cannot solve one

640
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:52,119
crisis at the expense of other crisis

641
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:53,710
and nobody asks how many crises can

642
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,539
erupt at the same time but we have to be

643
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,669
capable ready that's the point but

644
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:59,619
talking about priorities adaptation in

645
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:02,019
particular also the storm is very good

646
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:04,299
belief it's deserves to mention at least

647
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:06,850
we didn't mention yet strategic

648
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:09,850
communications' resilience this is also

649
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:12,519
war and you know instead of artillery

650
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:15,129
attack we have brainwashing and this is

651
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:16,929
taking place everywhere and if you think

652
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:18,609
that this is all only applicable to

653
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:20,739
Eastern European countries or those

654
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:21,789
under the influence of Russia you quite

655
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:23,440
throw wrong Oh

656
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:25,210
no it's not because it states saying

657
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,119
it's applicable to Western Europe

658
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:29,139
everywhere and it's under underestimated

659
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:30,609
for a long time

660
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:32,619
I remember our discussions when we

661
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:34,840
discussed at the beginning in in in the

662
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:36,639
midst of European Union for instance and

663
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,889
the first reaction from some colleagues

664
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:40,689
was you know look it's censorship its

665
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:42,580
freedom of speech you know the

666
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,830
alternative points of view I said yes

667
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:47,439
but I'm always saying and repeating lie

668
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,759
is not alternative point of view it's

669
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,769
it's really what about if I turn to the

670
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:54,279
fact how about alternative facts is that

671
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:56,700
acceptable that facts I agree but if

672
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,919
you're deliberately lying spreading lies

673
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,679
brainwashing audience did before

674
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,869
annexation of Crimea beat whatever this

675
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:07,299
is weapon you know by the way talking

676
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:09,249
about the costs of our missiles you know

677
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:09,759
you're shooting missile which is quite

678
00:33:09,249 --> 00:33:13,299
costly

679
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:15,820
but if it costs less than target right

680
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:16,720
right that's ok but in strategic

681
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,749
communications

682
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,279
you can shoot many times basically if

683
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:23,619
you prepared if you're really doing that

684
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,690
in proper way we really underestimated

685
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:27,070
that for the wrong time and I also like

686
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,609
to say what we're we have to pull

687
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:33,249
resources also issue for European and

688
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:34,899
the NATO cooperation it's also the case

689
00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:38,979
we are talking about the same threats

690
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:40,959
basically but we still still not not

691
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:43,109
capable to address problem proper way

692
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,279
even coming back to the substantial

693
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:47,830
capabilities when we have for instance

694
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,409
the Rapid Reaction forces right we have

695
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,599
in a widget ETF and the ref in and NATO

696
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:54,519
we also have battle groups in European

697
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,320
Union and as we all know so as former

698
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,239
defense minister can say I was always

699
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,668
dreaming to have the same set of forces

700
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:02,200
for all regardless which flag is

701
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:04,539
European Union or NATO but it's

702
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,070
important to have the same but in fact

703
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:06,460
we have the battle groups never used at

704
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,250
all

705
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,619
let's let's be frank for for some

706
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,260
political reasons or whatever but we're

707
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:16,119
still still not competing but maybe not

708
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,280
duplicating a whole but still having

709
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:20,260
this autonomous developments here is

710
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,450
really something we have to look at very

711
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,339
seriously it has to do not only be the

712
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:27,129
efficiency of our activity but also a

713
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:29,049
respect of money of taxpayers by by the

714
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,558
way why we should duplicate these things

715
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:33,940
and you know maybe somebody has these

716
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:35,780
illusions in their discussions that

717
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:38,659
we're having some autonomy and that

718
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,310
means the superiority one against

719
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:42,140
another organization it's not the case

720
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,900
we really have to take it very very

721
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:47,658
seriously but my main point main point

722
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,668
why I wanted to jump in was definitely

723
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,200
this resilience with regard to the

724
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:53,870
strategic communications what we are

725
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,879
still losing in my view we can win this

726
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:59,180
war but we are still losing for the

727
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,770
reasons unexplainable maybe not enough

728
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:03,169
resources maybe not enough manpower

729
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:04,730
maybe something else but this is really

730
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,610
something very serious and we have to

731
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,780
adapt ourselves to this I want to just

732
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,920
ask the audience to start thinking we're

733
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,570
going to turn to questions pretty soon

734
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,950
start thinking of what you want to hear

735
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,060
from our panelists things that I - ask

736
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,919
things they haven't brought up but

737
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,660
general you had a finger up about the

738
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,870
minister I thought was has made a very

739
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,330
important point and it's easy to

740
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:25,580
conceive of the competition with the

741
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:29,480
east in terms of in physical terms

742
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,069
in terms of physical forces but the

743
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,870
reality of course is something that the

744
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:34,730
Soviets did very well and the Russians

745
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,490
have carried on the capability it's it's

746
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:40,220
- to operate effectively in the

747
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,990
information sphere and so the question

748
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,750
we would need to ask ourselves is are we

749
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:48,680
organized adequately in the information

750
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:50,420
sphere both both to sense the Russian

751
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:53,779
influence operations with the minister

752
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:56,660
called information operations but are we

753
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,940
are we poised to sense it and are we

754
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,100
organized properly to be able to both

755
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,990
deter and defend against it and

756
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,880
ultimately if we have to to push back

757
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,200
against it one of the things that we

758
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,630
realized in the context of the

759
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,330
International Security Force Assistance

760
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,210
Force in Afghanistan the NATO force

761
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:15,950
there was we actively organized

762
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,440
ultimately into an information task

763
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,120
force because when you decide to move

764
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,400
troops or tanks or aircraft that's

765
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,500
that's a physical asset that you have to

766
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,900
move and it takes time to move it but if

767
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:30,290
you're able to sense the information

768
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:32,030
sphere you can move capability in the

769
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:34,910
information sphere at the speed of light

770
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:36,950
and so there's great capacity for us

771
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:38,540
both to sense and contest the

772
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:40,669
information sphere we need to be

773
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:43,640
thinking about that otherwise we are

774
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,890
simply going to be swamped over and over

775
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,470
again with these waves of dissing

776
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,290
fotomat Zeon or alternate facts or fake

777
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:51,720
news whatever it my

778
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:54,540
be all of it magnified by trolls account

779
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,160
constantly across social media if we

780
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,810
understand this and we can organize

781
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,220
against it we can also then operate

782
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,759
effectively in the information sphere

783
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,410
and it's yet another area where NATO

784
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,850
must be capable of adapting and I think

785
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,950
NATO is well on its way to thinking in

786
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:10,350
those terms tell us more about how the

787
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,629
how its adapted yeah I wanted first of

788
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:15,720
all to build on something General Allen

789
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:19,440
said but also to give a lot of credit to

790
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:22,350
Lithuania because many of you are aware

791
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,120
of what happened last summer with this

792
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:27,779
case of the of leza

793
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:31,850
in Germany the young German Russian girl

794
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:36,450
who was evidently raped by a migrant

795
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:39,330
from the Islamic world very very led to

796
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:42,720
a lot of political difficulties even

797
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:45,900
even protests marches on the street well

798
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,839
lo and behold some months later another

799
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:52,080
situation with a 13 year old Lithuanian

800
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:55,830
girl this time raped by a German soldier

801
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:58,290
arriving in Lithuania to take part in

802
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,840
the formation of the battle group well

803
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,150
hmm the Lithuanian media was very astute

804
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:05,250
on this occasion and said this looks

805
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,580
suspiciously similar to the Lisa case

806
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,200
which was proven to be absolutely false

807
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,090
looked at this case with a critical eye

808
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,399
I think the government was very helpful

809
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:16,830
in that regard in dealing with the

810
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
public on this and in the end it was

811
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:22,650
diffused rather quickly as I understand

812
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,899
because everybody said immediately this

813
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,610
looks fishy it looks too close to the

814
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,290
case from last summer which was proven

815
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,270
to be false so the only point I want to

816
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,040
make building on what both the minister

817
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,710
said and giving credit to lift wainy in

818
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,170
this case but also general allen we are

819
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,180
learning and learning fast and we are

820
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:42,240
responding i think already better than

821
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:45,690
we were but we can't ever be asleep on

822
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,490
this matter because these these attacks

823
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:49,440
are coming hard and fast and they are

824
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,629
adaptable they adapt to different

825
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,540
circumstances and of course the public

826
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,880
still needs to be I think brought along

827
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,009
to be a lot more critical in how they

828
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,350
look at events when they come across

829
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:02,740
either social media or conventional

830
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:06,460
media so and I

831
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:08,229
think we've been from an yen Stoltenberg

832
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,470
is very good about this appealing to the

833
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:13,150
press to say look you need to help us to

834
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:16,089
be more critical about these stories

835
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:18,070
that come in it's up to you to help but

836
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,650
I think we all need to be alert and do

837
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,060
what we can do to help as well all right

838
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,800
I'm going to open things up to the

839
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,150
audience for questions that people will

840
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,310
come along with microphones when I call

841
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,690
on you before I call on anyone though I

842
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,230
do just want to remind everyone to

843
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:34,030
please ask a question not an observation

844
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,680
on an argument please ask a question we

845
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:37,930
have a font of wisdom here on the stage

846
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,419
we want to let them get to your points

847
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:42,100
and you know don't be that guy please

848
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,710
don't be the one that I have to say hey

849
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:47,170
ask a question okay all right we'll

850
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,670
begin here with the lady in the white

851
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:50,680
sweater please so please tell us who you

852
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,119
are and ask your question thank you I'm

853
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,490
honored Icelander with the Atlantic

854
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,680
Council Northern Europe and I would like

855
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:59,500
to bring in the partner perspective to

856
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,690
this discussion we have a Sweden and

857
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,940
Finland through cooperative security and

858
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:06,700
international missions being very close

859
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,950
to NATO and that has continued also as

860
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,960
NATO has moved towards collective

861
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:13,210
defence and not least in the Baltic Sea

862
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,700
security setting that has been very

863
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:18,280
important but how close can we go if we

864
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:22,118
look ahead now for NATO when it comes to

865
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,470
partner cooperation in this context we'd

866
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,030
like to take that question first how

867
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,350
much closer can we get how much more

868
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:28,420
involved in the part well I'll start

869
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:30,190
perhaps and I think everybody's going to

870
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,590
have a view on this because I wanted to

871
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:35,230
say Sweden and Finland are really among

872
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:39,790
well they are among our closest partners

873
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:42,760
with extensive cooperation every day

874
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:46,420
we're involved together in Baltic Air

875
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:49,420
Policing as one example where we are all

876
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,280
working together day in day out on this

877
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,350
this important matter but furthermore

878
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,859
doing a lot more training and exercising

879
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:58,600
together and there will be a significant

880
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:00,549
exercise coming up in September that

881
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,880
Sweden is hosting but many NATO

882
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:07,510
countries will be involved in it so the

883
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:09,520
relationship is already very close and I

884
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,440
think you know in the end it gets back

885
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,240
to the point I made earlier about how

886
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,539
close to those countries actually want

887
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:20,019
to get to NATO that is also a decision

888
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:23,859
for for nations to make in their own

889
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:26,709
domestic settings so there's a limit the

890
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:28,359
the outer limit of membership takes you

891
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:31,359
so far and the outer limit of

892
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:33,038
partnership takes you so far so you know

893
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:38,439
in the end there are decisions that have

894
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:40,559
to be made about about how far to go can

895
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:43,209
I can I also would you like to please

896
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,919
yes okay everyone region you know I have

897
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,239
to say yes I understand so value very

898
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,729
much of a partnership and I have to say

899
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,039
we can come as close as Sweden decides

900
00:41:48,729 --> 00:41:53,558
to come that would be short short answer

901
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:56,049
because we would really be very happy

902
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:58,599
not deciding anything for for Sweden but

903
00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:00,038
we really would be very happy to have as

904
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:03,009
close as possible because they are very

905
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:05,439
active in diplomacy in our missions NATO

906
00:42:03,009 --> 00:42:07,779
missions and the quality of their

907
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:10,419
participation it's really doesn't need

908
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:12,609
to be commented but I also would like to

909
00:42:10,419 --> 00:42:14,679
say although the you they are not allies

910
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:16,779
but they are really allies their allies

911
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,979
that they are not neutral by far when it

912
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:20,949
comes to the developments in the region

913
00:42:17,979 --> 00:42:22,658
and I can say that from another another

914
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:23,650
format which is Nordic Baltic what's

915
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:25,599
very valuable for us

916
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,249
we all remember this you know

917
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,769
mathematics when it were called five

918
00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:32,140
plus three right five nordic three

919
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:34,928
Baltic now it's naturally became Nordic

920
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:37,118
Baltic eight basically and we appreciate

921
00:42:34,929 --> 00:42:39,640
very much that such a courtesy of our

922
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,380
Nordic colleagues in inviting us with

923
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,019
all aspects of the cooperation including

924
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:46,319
security in this in this Nordic Baltic

925
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:49,658
family so we really would like to have

926
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:52,329
Sweden and Finland definitely up to your

927
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:54,309
decisions as close as possible general

928
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:56,679
Juma says I do and I think the

929
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:58,779
partnership potential is enormous for

930
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,749
NATO again when we think about the

931
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:03,489
environment in which we exist today

932
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:05,589
especially the environment of the the

933
00:43:03,489 --> 00:43:07,869
that is generating so much instability

934
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:10,689
in the South the NATO's partnership with

935
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:13,150
Arab states is extremely important

936
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:15,339
because they provide both valuable

937
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:17,439
insights I think back into Brussels and

938
00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:19,359
malls on the security and the stability

939
00:43:17,439 --> 00:43:22,629
environment in there but that they also

940
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,659
can become platforms as NATO seeks

941
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:28,299
ultimately to extend stability into that

942
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:29,300
region it's very important and also you

943
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:30,680
know Australia

944
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,290
has been one of the great partners I

945
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,839
think that we could have imagined in the

946
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:37,430
NATO context not only in their

947
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,410
performance on the ground in Afghanistan

948
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,600
their performance it's not a NATO

949
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,759
mission but it's in the context of the

950
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,620
counter-isil coalition but also

951
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,290
australia has the capacity based on

952
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:50,270
where it is located to provide us

953
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:53,180
enormous ly valuable input with respect

954
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,610
to East Asia where this report will when

955
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:58,310
it finally comes out we'll talk about

956
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:00,800
the role of NATO specifically with China

957
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,900
in fact in the dialogue with China but

958
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,620
also Australia's views on China as well

959
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,480
so I think the partnership aspect has

960
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,480
unlimited potential for NATO in

961
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,860
conjunction just it's 29 members next

962
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,720
question we'll go to the gentleman here

963
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:20,360
a white shirt well thank you device Adak

964
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,759
associate professor my question is

965
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,220
relevant perhaps more to deputy

966
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,760
secretary and general Allen you touched

967
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:31,430
upon the counterterrorism and NATO well

968
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:35,060
in new NATO strategy to keep NATO

969
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:37,480
strategically relevant where do you

970
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:41,600
think counterterrorism cooperation

971
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,610
between the allies should fit better to

972
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,440
short suggestions and I'd like to hear

973
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,880
your take on that one

974
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,960
don't you think NATO should be more

975
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,450
proactive especially considering the

976
00:44:49,960 --> 00:45:01,070
evolving hybrid nature of threats and

977
00:44:53,450 --> 00:45:05,569
number two about definition and allied

978
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:07,460
consensus on counterterrorism to what

979
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:10,460
extent do you think NATO should only

980
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,800
restrict itself with the jihadi element

981
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:15,830
or should it broaden to capture the

982
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,930
concerns of all allies in the picture

983
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:21,380
and have a more effective strategic

984
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:23,060
development alliance thank you

985
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,980
well it's a very good question very

986
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,080
important question I one of the things I

987
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:29,420
would start by saying is that you know

988
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:31,940
the last time the NATO strategic concept

989
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:34,210
was updated was in 2010 if I think

990
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,190
that's right but in any case that's

991
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,530
that's a long time ago and much has

992
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:43,250
happened since then so it may be in the

993
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:46,310
context of a 2018 summit time to present

994
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,930
this as a coherent intention with

995
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:50,299
respect to NATO's strategic concept

996
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:53,290
countering terrorism I think in the

997
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:56,120
context of not just the internal

998
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:59,900
directional driver for Europe and NATO

999
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:03,200
that it deserves greater attention in

1000
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,820
the context of providing cooperation at

1001
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,790
the top level between NATO and the EU

1002
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:10,310
but I think there is capability here and

1003
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:14,090
remembering that in internal security of

1004
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:16,160
NATO is a sovereign national issue which

1005
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:19,970
largely remains in the hands of law

1006
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,640
enforcement how we can we at the top

1007
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:25,899
level at the at the super level can

1008
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,730
provide the flow of information between

1009
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,530
the NATO and EU and then down into

1010
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,170
sovereign states to help them as we get

1011
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:35,480
indications warnings and indications

1012
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:37,280
that's an important role in the future

1013
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,500
also NATO has the capacity working

1014
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,270
closely with the EU to help counter

1015
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,010
terrorist forces or Counter Terrorist

1016
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:45,490
capabilities or what we might use our

1017
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:48,920
law enforcement term special weapons and

1018
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:50,689
tactics units so SWAT units at the law

1019
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,480
enforcement level I think there's a lot

1020
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:57,200
of capability that can be harvested

1021
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:00,350
because between the cooperation of NATO

1022
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,710
and the EU and the states of the

1023
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:06,640
Alliance but I also agree if terrorism

1024
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:08,720
is not just a Salah feed jihadi

1025
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,460
phenomena there's there are lots of

1026
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,649
other terrorists at entities out there

1027
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,880
and increasingly it's difficult to tell

1028
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:16,850
the difference between a terrorist

1029
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,340
entity and a criminal network and in

1030
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,440
fact we know I think as we study this

1031
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,630
more closely as time goes on that the

1032
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,090
lamination between terrorist networks

1033
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:27,680
and criminal networks is sometimes so

1034
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,140
blurred it's impossible to tell the

1035
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,460
difference one day they're conducting a

1036
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,350
terrorist attack the next day they're

1037
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:35,150
robbing a bank to provide their supports

1038
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,930
the next day they're kidnapping someone

1039
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,120
for ransom

1040
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:40,250
it's it's all criminal activity

1041
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,900
sometimes they justified in the context

1042
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:44,570
of their terrorist objectives sometimes

1043
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,890
it's just criminality so it's very it's

1044
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,960
a very important law enforcement

1045
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,790
dimension to this as well and I think we

1046
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,410
need to be able to understand that and

1047
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:53,420
then finally in terms of countering

1048
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,759
terror and then the counter-terror

1049
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,920
mission we have many of our partners not

1050
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,650
members necessarily

1051
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,450
but partners outside the NATO area that

1052
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:03,640
are really beleaguered by terrorism

1053
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:05,200
constantly in terrorist attacks and this

1054
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,819
is where NATO can be very important to

1055
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,109
them and helping them to understand the

1056
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,870
environment in which they live and

1057
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:13,210
helping them not doing it for them but

1058
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:15,160
helping them to create the security

1059
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,140
platform within those countries that can

1060
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,089
create the capacity for other

1061
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:21,069
governmental development capacity

1062
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:23,710
development so on so there's a lot of

1063
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,900
room for NATO I think to do to do this

1064
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:28,120
and it and I don't as I think through

1065
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,890
this as I inventory this the the menu of

1066
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,200
things that NATO can do these are not

1067
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:33,370
big-ticket issues either frankly these

1068
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,060
are areas that can be done

1069
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:38,020
organizationally more so than with large

1070
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,470
procurement requirements and that sort

1071
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,050
of thing

1072
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:42,759
let me just add very quickly that was a

1073
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:45,430
very comprehensive answer but I wanted

1074
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,560
to re-emphasize the point Linda's made a

1075
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:50,200
moment ago about NATO's 360-degree

1076
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:53,380
approach and this really counts in the

1077
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:55,629
counterterrorism arena as well as how we

1078
00:48:53,380 --> 00:49:00,310
think about deterrence and defense in

1079
00:48:55,630 --> 00:49:01,890
the Alliance so the problem here now is

1080
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,360
filling out some of those capabilities

1081
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,430
especially as we redouble our efforts to

1082
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,160
focus on the challenges from the south

1083
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:10,870
part of what we have agreed in recent

1084
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,940
months is a so-called hub for the south

1085
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:15,700
how are we going to fill out that

1086
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:17,530
capability and use it in the most

1087
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,279
effective way possible to fight

1088
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:22,960
terrorism we just a couple of months ago

1089
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,720
went to Kuwait and opened a

1090
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,310
counterterrorism well training center

1091
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:30,459
there one of the goals of which will be

1092
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:32,380
to provide a platform for training - to

1093
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,750
really wrestle with some of these

1094
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:37,660
problems of the emergence of violent

1095
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:40,420
extremism and and the results of violent

1096
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,129
extremism so it's an issue now and this

1097
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:44,770
picks up on the point General Allen made

1098
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:46,990
about not you know high ticket items

1099
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:49,150
we're not talking about the development

1100
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,470
of big new technologies in many cases

1101
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,720
but we're talking about going to the

1102
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,640
countries and saying hey can you help us

1103
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,830
with voluntary national contributions

1104
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,330
can you help us with trainers we've had

1105
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,000
good success and that was one of the

1106
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:02,740
outcomes of the meeting on Thursday good

1107
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,320
success with countries now stepping

1108
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:07,240
forward to help with training missions

1109
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,720
in Iraq and we are just delighted about

1110
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,220
that

1111
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:13,640
and Slovakia among them just

1112
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:16,069
lighted about it so really I wanted to

1113
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:18,650
again appeal to this audience as you're

1114
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:22,190
working in capitals to think about how

1115
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:24,970
on the human capital side the allies and

1116
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:28,010
the partners can be can be helping more

1117
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:35,390
okay we'll go to the gentleman here with

1118
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:37,099
the bow tie in the second row yes good

1119
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:39,560
morning Constantine eget from Moscow my

1120
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:43,580
question is about not directly related

1121
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:45,710
to security issues as such but it's

1122
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,740
related to sanctions against Russian

1123
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:51,619
officials we've seen the United States

1124
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:55,819
but accepting the new ambassador who's

1125
00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:58,250
on the EU sanctions list and the Russian

1126
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:02,750
ambassador and then we have Igor Sechin

1127
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:05,960
opening a huge Rosneft representation in

1128
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:10,070
Germany actually a sister company

1129
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:12,349
Rosneft Doland in Berlin with the

1130
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:15,080
promise of kind of half a billion

1131
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:17,750
investment in Germany and he's on the US

1132
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,369
sanctions list a do you envision by the

1133
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:21,619
way it's full for the panel whoever

1134
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:24,950
cares to answer do you envisage this

1135
00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:26,900
gradual slackening of sanctions you know

1136
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:30,200
and return to business as usual because

1137
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:33,050
these these two to me seem to be signs

1138
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:36,669
on both sides of the Atlantic that these

1139
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:41,680
lists don't don't really matter anymore

1140
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:41,680
and one wanna take a Saxon question no

1141
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:46,460
new are you saying no the answer is no

1142
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:48,230
or no you don't want to take it no I'm

1143
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,670
just saying oh oh the answer to constant

1144
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,320
question is no I don't see any

1145
00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:54,619
slackening and they had that of course

1146
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:57,950
the more words to this you want you also

1147
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:58,670
want to say no hahaha Konstantin

1148
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:03,140
Vonnegut

1149
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:05,330
he was also some week ago right in in

1150
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:08,569
Vilnius we had close to Vilnius we had

1151
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:11,690
Russian forum and was widely presented

1152
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:15,020
from reputation from Russian civil

1153
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:17,150
society those who still can be in Russia

1154
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,740
they came from Russia those who not they

1155
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,570
came from all over the world and was

1156
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:22,339
really very interesting dialogue by the

1157
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,550
way it's part of the dialogue we agreed

1158
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:25,960
with in European

1159
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:29,230
among the Selective engagement

1160
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,890
resilience sanctions dialogue of civil

1161
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,810
society

1162
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:33,940
it should be done really and what why

1163
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:36,070
I'm not going to talk about this forum

1164
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:38,530
which is another subject but just on

1165
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,510
sanctions my my take was from the

1166
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,950
discussions with these people exactly

1167
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:44,619
about the stank individual sanctions

1168
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:46,779
they said this really must be expanded

1169
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:49,180
must be used it's really influential has

1170
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:51,550
the impact and we are going to do that

1171
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:53,649
but you know how it's easy to to reach

1172
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:55,180
consensus but I believe we really have

1173
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,430
to take it very seriously because it's

1174
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:01,779
the only leverage were using to press

1175
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:04,330
Russia or Kremlin to be precise I feel

1176
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,230
the sanctions are working well if they

1177
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:11,980
are not working well let's add sanctions

1178
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:13,930
okay Oh should we I believe we should

1179
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:16,510
but it's not so easy to do as I said but

1180
00:53:13,930 --> 00:53:18,310
we but but but to lift it would be

1181
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:19,330
really a big mistake and I hope I

1182
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,310
believe we will not do that

1183
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:25,750
okay brother punishment I just want to

1184
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:27,820
add one word the new Russian ambassador

1185
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:29,560
to Washington is a very capable diplomat

1186
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:33,930
he was my counterpart at the negotiating

1187
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:36,340
table for the New START treaty and so

1188
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:41,770
apparently he's now been confirmed by

1189
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:45,720
the by the Russian parliament and so I

1190
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:48,759
think it's it's a good choice okay

1191
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,290
next gentleman here in the corner please

1192
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:52,300
let us know who you are and ask your

1193
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:54,430
question Jonathan aisle from ruse in

1194
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,350
London I think my question is directly

1195
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:59,169
to Rose and directly from the neck from

1196
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:00,790
the previous question you had a lifetime

1197
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:02,680
experience of dealing with the Russians

1198
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:04,660
you don't need many lessons from others

1199
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,629
about how to deal with them you

1200
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:10,210
mentioned the two-track approach to to

1201
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:13,060
dealing with Russia do you believe that

1202
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:15,520
we have in place all the instruments for

1203
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:19,180
dealing with Russia at the moment do you

1204
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:21,640
think we require new thinking in in NATO

1205
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:25,868
or using the new thinking is required

1206
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:29,350
only in Moscow well you know we have a

1207
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:31,550
lot of experience both as individual

1208
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:35,960
members of the Alliance

1209
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:38,600
and inside the alliance as well so in

1210
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,210
terms of new instruments I don't think

1211
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,250
so it's really important to think about

1212
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:46,310
what instruments we pick up off the

1213
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:48,980
table and this question goes for both

1214
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:52,070
Moscow and I would say for Brussels NATO

1215
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:55,270
headquarters the emphasis that we have

1216
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:58,640
had inside NATO on our nato-russia

1217
00:54:55,270 --> 00:55:01,070
Council discussion over the last four

1218
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:05,450
sessions I participated in in two of

1219
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:08,000
them first of all on Ukraine and NATO's

1220
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:11,180
very real concerns about Russia's

1221
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,680
aggressive actions toward Ukraine second

1222
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,960
and this is interesting Russia brought

1223
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,910
this to the table Afghanistan and what's

1224
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,970
going on in Afghanistan it does give us

1225
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:22,819
an opportunity to I think question

1226
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:25,399
Russia about about their view of what's

1227
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:27,950
going on in Afghanistan I know you've

1228
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:30,410
all seen concerns expressed in the media

1229
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:33,169
about Russia's current interactions with

1230
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:35,000
the Taliban I share those concerns but

1231
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:38,090
it's an opportunity to talk about them

1232
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,270
at the nato-russia table and the third

1233
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:43,040
area which i think is very important is

1234
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:44,960
Incident Response the necessity of

1235
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:50,270
looking for ways to build predictability

1236
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:52,340
and in confidence between Russia and the

1237
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:53,690
NATO alliance because over the past

1238
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:55,970
couple years we've seen so many

1239
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:58,460
incidents in the air over the Baltic Sea

1240
00:55:55,970 --> 00:56:00,230
at sea in the Baltic Sea and they

1241
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:03,020
continue again Lennis can talk about

1242
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:06,110
those even with regard to commercial

1243
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:10,240
shipping it's it's a very very difficult

1244
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:13,370
and I would say preventable situation so

1245
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,990
frankly what I would like to see in the

1246
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:18,560
nato-russia Council is an

1247
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:21,439
intensification of actual work on

1248
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,970
incident response and problem solving in

1249
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,400
that arena building up that

1250
00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:28,609
predictability and mutual confidence and

1251
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:32,330
there I think I think Moscow could take

1252
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:34,130
a good hard look at what benefits they

1253
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:36,529
might enjoy from being a little more

1254
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:40,580
focused and enthusiastic in that regard

1255
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:43,090
because as a matter of fact it's you

1256
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:45,319
know in the interest of NATO countries

1257
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:47,119
but we also see it as

1258
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,558
matter of mutual interest they should be

1259
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,749
concerned about preventing incidents

1260
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,140
that could affect their security going

1261
00:56:50,749 --> 00:56:56,359
forward as well so that is what I would

1262
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,459
say Jonathan in answer your question

1263
00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:00,380
thank you

1264
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:04,098
right we had the gentleman immediately

1265
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,549
to my right here please thank you very

1266
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:07,670
much

1267

Stefano stefanini former Italian firm

1268
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:15,619
rep to NATO and participating as a

1269
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:17,899
writer right to the network adaptation

1270
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:20,420
exercise as a loved last question to

1271
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:23,869
Melissa Lee kovitch about the

1272
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:25,789
decision-making process in in NATO

1273
00:57:23,869 --> 00:57:28,160
especially we're amending a side

1274
00:57:25,789 --> 00:57:29,749
discussion we had at a time when it was

1275
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:31,519
actually between Ian's all the after

1276
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:34,069
consensus but now I want to address a

1277
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:37,339
question that - an issue that General

1278
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:40,819
Allen erased the nexus you mention all

1279
00:57:37,339 --> 00:57:48,288
converging lines between counter

1280
00:57:40,819 --> 00:57:53,209
terrorism and mass magnet migrations the

1281
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:55,309
g7 is going to come up long on

1282
00:57:53,209 --> 00:57:58,308
counterterrorism and short on

1283
00:57:55,309 --> 00:58:02,660
immigration as a battle of termina which

1284
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:05,509
is being lost by Italy on that map do

1285
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:09,078
you think that NATO can somewhat correct

1286
00:58:05,509 --> 00:58:14,049
this balance if you think that there is

1287
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:17,599
a strong nexus between the two and what

1288
00:58:14,049 --> 00:58:20,779
you and I are strong believers in

1289
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,559
partnerships what partnerships can do in

1290
00:58:20,779 --> 00:58:24,829
this regard

1291
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:28,130
Thank You general I thought it was to do

1292
00:58:24,829 --> 00:58:32,329
is this yeah who would you be who you

1293
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:34,219
ask you specifically sir yes writers

1294
00:58:32,329 --> 00:58:38,239
don't get to ask the steering committee

1295
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:42,499
no well I think you know there's lots of

1296
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:46,219
ways that that the issue with respect to

1297
00:58:42,499 --> 00:58:48,169
migration there it's one of the hardest

1298
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:50,479
problems that Europe is facing right now

1299
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:54,850
and of course he'll by and large or by

1300
00:58:50,479 --> 00:58:58,419
extension the Alliance trying to

1301
00:58:54,850 --> 00:59:00,940
NATO having a role in those countries

1302
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:03,900
that are potentially fragile or failing

1303
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:06,430
States to assist those states in

1304
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,470
improving the security platform which

1305
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:11,049
then Vermont provides for the

1306
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:12,790
capacity-building at the national level

1307
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:16,240
whether it's judiciary or whatever it

1308
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:19,500
might be that's a way that NATO can have

1309
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,419
a role specifically in helping a state

1310
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:24,250
through an advisory mission or a

1311
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:27,580
security assistance mission not a

1312
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:30,880
fighting mission to provide that state

1313
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:32,590
the capacity for stability and every one

1314
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,510
of those states that goes over the side

1315
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:36,340
if you will every one of those fragile

1316
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:39,160
states or failing states that ultimately

1317
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:41,380
fails I think we all know that that's

1318
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:43,210
going to create another wave of human

1319
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:46,750
migration because they've all seen

1320
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:48,610
what's happened in in Europe and so many

1321
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,960
of these migrants and we can argue about

1322
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:52,960
why they came with their economic

1323
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:55,210
migrants or political fleeing political

1324
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,760
situations or they are in fact migrants

1325
00:59:55,210 --> 01:00:00,040
because of a horrific wartime situation

1326
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:03,370
nonetheless they came by the millions

1327
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:05,590
and it has not been lost on many

1328
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:07,029
populations across North Africa and I

1329
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:08,470
have to tell you we need to make sure

1330
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:10,930
we're paying close attention to the

1331
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:13,779
Maghreb and North Africa because there

1332
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:15,339
are millions of disaffected young men

1333
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:17,680
and women and that part of the world as

1334
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:21,040
well where the states have have

1335
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:23,109
borderline capacity to provide for their

1336
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:26,020
futures and as those states become more

1337
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:28,030
fragile and as the pressures on their

1338
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:30,340
internal security mechanisms become

1339
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:33,430
greater this is an important role that

1340
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:35,110
the community of nations broadly the

1341
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:37,839
European Union can be of assistance but

1342
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:39,700
NATO can have a specific hand in helping

1343
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,470
those states to stabilize themselves so

1344
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,990
we don't end up with another two or

1345
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:45,220
three million migrants coming in so I

1346
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:47,859
don't think NATO is going to have

1347
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:49,660
necessarily a role in blocking the flow

1348
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:51,370
of migrants or channeling the flow of

1349
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,290
migrants in the European context I

1350
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:55,029
believe that's that's something more for

1351
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:56,950
the EU and the individual states to have

1352
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:58,780
to deal with but in terms of NATO

1353
01:00:56,950 --> 01:01:00,819
extending stability I think that's a

1354
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:03,310
vital mission frankly and it's not

1355
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:05,470
counterterrorism it is helping to those

1356
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:07,990
states themselves to change the human

1357
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:08,720
condition by having a security platform

1358
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:11,118
within

1359
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,399
it's own governmental capacity-building

1360
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:15,680
can occur that I think is one of the

1361
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,839
best way it's a long-term objective and

1362
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,970
Rose called it a generational issue it

1363
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,799
is a generational issue but if we don't

1364
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:23,930
get at it we know that in the South

1365
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,089
there are many fragile states and some

1366
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:28,310
of them are failing every one of them is

1367
01:01:26,089 --> 01:01:30,380
going to generate migration and if we

1368
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:32,810
can stabilize them a thousand kilometers

1369
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:35,270
from Brussels then everyone benefits the

1370
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:41,150
people the state and ultimately the

1371
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:42,829
Atlantic Alliance yes the lady on the

1372
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:44,859
end of the platform of the edge of the

1373
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:47,359
road there yes thank you

1374
01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:50,299
Neelam Dave I'm from Gateway house in

1375
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:53,180
Mumbai India there been some passing

1376
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:55,730
references to China and I just wanted to

1377
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:58,040
ask what the thinking is NATO has been

1378
01:01:55,730 --> 01:02:01,550
in Afghanistan along with the United

1379
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:04,880
States for decades a few days ago it was

1380
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:09,020
reported that the Chinese expressed

1381
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:11,720
displeasure with a u.s. ship that went

1382
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:14,780
close to the Spratly Islands near the

1383
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:18,828
Philippines so and of course there are

1384
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:22,089
there's a battle group near the South

1385
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:25,280
Korea so what's the thinking on NATO

1386
01:02:22,089 --> 01:02:28,970
participation in the Pacific Ocean in

1387
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:31,430
other parts of Asia thank you thank you

1388
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:33,348
for that question again I'll just say a

1389
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:35,899
few words to start my colleagues

1390
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:40,790
probably have some comments as well

1391
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:43,520
NATO really does try to maintain good

1392
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:45,859
lines of communication with countries in

1393
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,680
Asia in terms of geographic spread I

1394
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:55,029
don't see NATO spreading beyond where

1395
01:02:48,680 --> 01:03:00,169
it's kind of natural territory is but I

1396
01:02:55,030 --> 01:03:02,930
think a good dialogue with countries in

1397
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:04,069
other parts of the world is very

1398
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,990
important

1399
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:08,839
General Allen mentioned in his report

1400
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:11,089
they are looking at the potential for

1401
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:13,520
broader communication between NATO and

1402
01:03:11,089 --> 01:03:16,880
China and I think that's that's very

1403
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:19,910
worth looking at we've long had

1404
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,160
a history of communications with the

1405
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:24,470
countries of South Asia as well to this

1406
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,109
at this current time we have military

1407
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:29,930
staff talks with with Pakistan which I

1408
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:33,950
think are helpful in the context of our

1409
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:36,078
continuing work as the NATO alliance in

1410
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:40,009
our training resolute support training

1411
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:42,170
mission in in Afghanistan so I think

1412
01:03:40,009 --> 01:03:44,720
from a NATO perspective we welcome those

1413
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:48,230
lines of communication being open we

1414
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:50,269
think it's it's beneficial but there are

1415
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:52,900
limits general Allen do you want to pick

1416
01:03:50,269 --> 01:03:56,868
up on this I hid it very well I think

1417
01:03:52,900 --> 01:04:00,319
the the one thing I would hope we're

1418
01:03:56,869 --> 01:04:03,589
thinking about would be the environment

1419
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:04,849
in Northeast Asia is pretty tense right

1420
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:08,210
now

1421
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:12,440
I don't think we really understand Kim

1422
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:14,690
Jung Woon's intentions I'm always very

1423
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:18,819
careful not to ascribe to someone like

1424
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:21,559
him that he's irrational or or not a

1425
01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:23,630
rational thinker he's he's thinking in

1426
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:26,299
the context of his own value system and

1427
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:28,759
his own national interests

1428
01:04:26,299 --> 01:04:32,990
we think he's poised potentially for a

1429
01:04:28,759 --> 01:04:34,910
6th nuclear test he's constantly firing

1430
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:36,680
ballistic missiles off in a provocative

1431
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:39,170
way whether it's to intimidate the new

1432
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:41,808
president South Korea we don't know my

1433
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:44,750
point is there is a hair-trigger

1434
01:04:41,809 --> 01:04:46,220
dimension to the security environment of

1435
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:47,960
North East Asia and I think it's not

1436
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:51,140
inappropriate for NATO to think through

1437
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,910
the process that if suddenly war broke

1438
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:55,250
out on the Korean Peninsula what did

1439
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:56,328
what our article 5 implications in that

1440
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:58,039
regard

1441
01:04:56,329 --> 01:05:00,019
should that war be an aggressive war

1442
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:02,660
that's launched from North Korea to

1443
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:04,729
South Korea and American forces in the

1444
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:07,788
region come under widespread and

1445
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:09,500
long-range ballistic missile attack I'm

1446
01:05:07,789 --> 01:05:11,029
not proposing that we would invoke

1447
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,680
article 5 but I think we should think

1448
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:16,130
through the potential implications of

1449
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,640
that a question at the very back room

1450
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:19,519
please

1451
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:21,200
yes ma'am yes thank you Natalie nuga

1452
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,868
read from The Guardian I wanted to ask

1453
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,259
you about the European Union's

1454
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:27,690
contribution to

1455
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:29,640
ooh stability and security around Europe

1456
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:33,660
not we're talking about negative of

1457
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:35,640
course but I wanted to note that Donald

1458
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:38,100
Trump went to Brussels of course to

1459
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:41,629
visit NATO but he also actually visited

1460
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:45,930
EU institutions which got less attention

1461
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:47,940
and and I think I remember that Obama

1462
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:50,069
actually visited Brussels EU

1463
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:53,670
institutions only 2014 I'm not saying

1464
01:05:50,070 --> 01:05:56,880
Trump is more EU interested in the year

1465
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:58,650
than Obama is certainly not but I think

1466
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:01,530
that there's a symbol there that we we

1467
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:03,390
haven't really dwelled on and although

1468
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:06,600
your focus is obviously NATO and

1469
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:08,460
although the EU NATO debate has been

1470
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:11,040
going on and on for four years you know

1471
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,630
which which comes first that's not my

1472
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:15,240
question my question is at this point

1473
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:17,160
with Britain pulling out of the EU with

1474
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:20,430
apparently a new German franco-german

1475
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:22,200
couple trying to build up some some kind

1476
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:24,690
of dynamic a new dynamic on the

1477
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:26,520
continent and because we can basically

1478
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:28,350
use all the tools we can get to

1479
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,880
stabilize our environment and stabilize

1480
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:33,180
the continent what are your thoughts

1481
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:37,650
today including mr. Minister on how the

1482
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:39,930
EU now EU member states as part of that

1483
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:42,780
club can contribute to to stability and

1484
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:45,540
security on the continent alongside NATO

1485
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:47,220
I welcome that question very much

1486
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:49,230
because of in this setting we haven't

1487
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,970
had a chance to talk about NATO EU

1488
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:53,280
cooperation

1489
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:55,439
I've been again impressed in my eight

1490
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,050
years eight years it feels like eight

1491
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,210
years it's been eight months in my

1492
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:03,330
butt's this job at we don't know the

1493
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:07,470
feeling here but even in this short

1494
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:09,870
period how much NATO EU relations have

1495
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:14,180
matured because we had at our foreign

1496
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:18,029
ministerial in December the signature of

1497
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:21,569
statement launching famous 42 proposals

1498
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:24,060
these are joint NATO au proposals for

1499
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:27,180
cooperation many of which are focused on

1500
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:28,529
the fight against terrorism and I wasn't

1501
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,149
there sandy were spouse here he could

1502
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:32,700
probably talk about this in more detail

1503
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:34,470
but I understand in previous years it

1504
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:37,200
was really hard to get cooperation off

1505
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:38,700
the ground institutionally the two

1506
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,740
institutions tended to

1507
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:43,169
butting heads including down through the

1508
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:45,720
staff levels and what I've seen in these

1509
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:48,270
eight months is and thanks to the fact

1510
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:50,368
that we had you know a very firm and

1511
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:52,770
clear at ministerial level joint

1512
01:07:50,369 --> 01:07:54,930
agreement in December to begin working

1513
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:57,119
together in a pragmatic way to implement

1514
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:58,379
these and a focused way I think that was

1515
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,650
part of the problem these are very

1516
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:04,680
focused these 42 proposals it has

1517
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:06,750
resulted in I would say much better

1518
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:09,210
institutional interaction and

1519
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:11,910
cooperation and we are now approaching

1520
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:14,160
the defense ministerial meeting in June

1521
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:16,500
and you'll see progress report at that

1522
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:19,500
time but just watching it from the

1523
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:21,120
inside and knowing about the history not

1524
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:26,488
having been present but knowing about it

1525
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:28,620
I constantly am and reflecting on how

1526
01:08:26,488 --> 01:08:30,238
far the two institutions have come in

1527
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:32,189
their cooperation over the past eight

1528
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:34,729
months so so I welcome it very much I'm

1529
01:08:32,189 --> 01:08:36,778
glad you opened the topic today and

1530
01:08:34,729 --> 01:08:38,968
literally what would you like that

1531
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:41,819
let's pleasure definitely as you said

1532
01:08:38,969 --> 01:08:44,339
this joint declaration really like fixed

1533
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:46,290
to the situation but also envisage to

1534
01:08:44,339 --> 01:08:48,540
what we are having in the future and

1535
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:49,710
really very good personal contacts very

1536
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:52,528
important second general of my

1537
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:54,330
representatives and these meetings I

1538
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:57,450
remember from my time also we're very

1539
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:59,609
fraught to be precise and with little

1540
01:08:57,450 --> 01:09:01,528
substance and now now we have much

1541
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:02,609
better although was always very good

1542
01:09:01,529 --> 01:09:04,230
cooperation on the ground

1543
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:06,960
maybe institutions we're talking not

1544
01:09:04,229 --> 01:09:09,000
very good but you is quite efficient in

1545
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,219
the worldwide arena I would say with the

1546
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,200
development the cooperation with the

1547
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:15,630
Hungarian assistance which is also who

1548
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:18,028
can argue big part of stability of

1549
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:20,430
security as well and the good potential

1550
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:23,460
for the future I also like to mention UK

1551
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:25,230
you said the case leaving you but but

1552
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:27,560
really as far as I understand you get

1553
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:32,099
definitely by far not leaving security

1554
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,750
cooperation and it's our our task and we

1555
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:36,480
have to keep them as close as possible

1556
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:38,580
to you basically but also to European

1557
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,679
adheres to the security affairs which is

1558
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:42,450
also position of UK as far as understand

1559
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:44,670
when talking to Boris Johnson and he's

1560
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:46,589
very keen to in the case saying that

1561
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:48,299
they will be even more active than they

1562
01:09:46,589 --> 01:09:50,219
were before we will see how it looks

1563
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:51,920
like what its reciprocal it's it's also

1564
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:55,310
from our side so we

1565
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:58,070
shouldn't just sort out and to say that

1566
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:59,420
UK is leaving because at least from my

1567
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:02,090
point of view from Lithuanian point of

1568
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:04,130
view of Baltic states the UK was always

1569
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:06,920
very close ally in whatever aspect speed

1570
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:08,840
United Nations or NATO European Union so

1571
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:11,390
I hope and believe we will preserve this

1572
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,420
partnership and cooperation and this is

1573
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:17,000
also a linkage with with between the

1574
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:20,210
Europe and and NATO because UK was

1575
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,429
always and still will be very strong

1576
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:24,140
proponent of our strong so to say

1577
01:10:22,429 --> 01:10:26,150
cooperation your Atlantic operation I

1578
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:28,100
believe will continue the same speed and

1579
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:30,710
the same spirit although in different

1580
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:32,210
capacity let's take one final question

1581
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:38,090
we'll go to the gentleman on the end of

1582
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:41,239
the row here I'm from United States of

1583
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:44,390
America and I have following question

1584
01:10:41,239 --> 01:10:47,419
you know we deal with migration and

1585
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:48,320
terrorism and we will deal with that for

1586
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:52,910
decades to come

1587
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:56,299
and president ram was kind of vocal that

1588
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:59,870
without a war in iraq which create

1589
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:02,719
ground for ISIL which led to all

1590
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:05,989
subsequent problems the situation might

1591
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:08,780
be different so my question is rather

1592
01:11:05,989 --> 01:11:12,049
than NATO being reactive and dealing

1593
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:15,290
with situation what we have do you see a

1594
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:18,199
mechanism opportunity to be proactive to

1595
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:20,360
prevent the situation which led to huge

1596
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:22,610
displacements of aiming runs which leads

1597
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:29,239
to terrorism being introduced to Europe

1598
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:31,370
and so on thank you sure if our only

1599
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:34,699
solution to terrorism is fighting then

1600
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:36,469
we're going to be fighting forever so we

1601
01:11:34,699 --> 01:11:39,169
have to fight to defend ourselves I

1602
01:11:36,469 --> 01:11:40,699
don't think anybody questions that but

1603
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:43,310
if that's the only way of dealing with

1604
01:11:40,699 --> 01:11:45,379
terror then that's the only way we'll

1605
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:46,969
ever deal with this and you can't fight

1606
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:49,219
your way out of a terrorist problem you

1607
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:51,020
can't kill your way out of a terrorist

1608
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:54,080
problem we have to think more broadly

1609
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:56,660
about the causal factors of why someone

1610
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,640
would be willing to join an extremist

1611
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:02,179
group and blow themselves up at a

1612
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:05,000
concert and that means we have to swim

1613
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:06,160
upstream if you will in the chain of

1614
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,130
human

1615
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:12,040
that creates in the end a suicide bomber

1616
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:14,920
no child in the world is born a

1617
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:17,200
terrorist something happens in the

1618
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:20,980
course of human events and that child's

1619
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:22,389
life that creates a moment and a trend

1620
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:25,330
towards something we'll call

1621
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:27,760
radicalization there's lots of radicals

1622
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:31,059
out there but when you've become

1623
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,770
radicalized because of insufferable

1624
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:35,440
human conditions under which you and

1625
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:37,950
your family have lived absence of human

1626
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:40,839
rights absence of justice absence of

1627
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:42,970
access to education absence of economic

1628
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:45,220
prospects when you've become radicalized

1629
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:47,020
you're really just one step away from

1630
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:50,680
being a recruit for an extremist

1631
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:52,930
organization so I worry about solutions

1632
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,520
that deal with what we call violent

1633
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:57,730
extremist organizations because we're

1634
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:01,050
already late if we're dealing with V EOS

1635
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:04,719
we as a community of nations have to

1636
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:07,630
diagnose the problem and get upstream

1637
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:10,470
from the symptom the symptom is

1638
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:12,670
terrorism the problem is the

1639
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:14,110
radicalization of millions of young men

1640
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:15,820
and women around the world today by

1641
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:18,940
virtue of the human condition which they

1642
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:21,549
live somewhat is propagated by radical

1643
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:23,950
Imams and mullahs but much of it is a

1644
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:27,070
function of the human condition NATO has

1645
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:29,670
a role in helping to stabilize nations

1646
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:32,320
that are that in some form or another in

1647
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:34,420
difficulty as a result of their own

1648
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,330
internal situation NATO can provide

1649
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:40,150
through security assistance and advisory

1650
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:41,820
capabilities the security platform in

1651
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:43,929
that country through which then the

1652
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:46,030
resolution of human condition can be

1653
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:48,460
undertaken but this didn't start last

1654
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:51,519
Tuesday and it's not going to stop next

1655
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:54,220
Tuesday this is as ROS properly said and

1656
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:56,320
we all have to gird ourselves for this

1657
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:58,690
this is a generational issue but if we

1658
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:01,920
don't get upstream and deal with the

1659
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:04,750
causal factors the solution cannot be

1660
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:06,880
interminable war against terror because

1661
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:08,980
that's the symptom of the bigger problem

1662
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,420
and we have to get after that I think

1663
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:12,490
that's a great place to end on an

1664
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:15,010
interesting point and I'd like to thank

1665

1666
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:17,849
