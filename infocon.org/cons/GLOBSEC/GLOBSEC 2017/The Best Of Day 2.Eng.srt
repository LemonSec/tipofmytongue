2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:10,860
we don't have to choose between trade

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:13,349
and progress countries whoever they are

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,389
they must have the right to choose their

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,060
security relationships for themselves

6
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:22,080
kind of all we're asking is can

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,689
countries in Europe spend 2% automating

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,389
the intelligence we see this as a best

9
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,070
way how to solve everything else look I

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,720
mean first of all donor money is not

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,340
necessarily only coming from the Gulf

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,839
states right there is quite a lot of

13
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,329
donor money actually coming out of

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,739
Europe we are sure that Russia China

15
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:43,140
Iran F cyberattacks of savvy espionage

16
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:43,769
that's false news in itself wouldn't be

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,770
harmful

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,450
it gets harmful when it is disseminated

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,860
I don't think the intelligence is

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,719
getting politicized I think you're

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,040
reporting about what the intelligence

22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,159
community says is getting permanent size

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,159
