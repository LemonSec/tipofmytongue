everybody and thank organizers for this

very important event security is the

39
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:57,030
cornerstone for everything we do so it's

40
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,979
important to discuss challenges

41
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,299
including upcoming challenges we face

42
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:06,539
and consolidate against those challenges

43
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:10,369
we Georgians reached an important

44
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,369
milestone visa liberalisation

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:17,280
is is an achievement which materializes

46
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:20,910
brings tangible results for European

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,360
aspiration of Georgia for that we had to

48
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,549
implement important reforms sign

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,290
association agreement together with deep

50
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,630
and comprehensive free trade area

51
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,600
agreement and launched a comprehensive

52
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,260
overhaul of Georgia's democratic

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,710
institutions legislation and through

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,720
approximate approximation of the local

55
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,750
institutional and legislative standards

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,380
we were able to achieve visa

57
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,080
liberalisation this is not only free

58
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,940
travel for Georgians but it also has a

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,160
deep political meaning that Europe

60
00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:00,140
opened the door for Georgians

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:05,250
this is a political step from Europe

62
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:08,850
again appreciating Georgia's efforts and

63
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:11,900
of course these efforts were not easy

64
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,070
it all comes at the background of

65
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,700
challenging security environment

66
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:20,880
occupation of Georgia's territories so

67
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,769
it is a big achievement now you are

68
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,130
asking what's next

69
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,920
of course we are preparing for the

70
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,530
Eastern Partnership summit which will be

71
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,929
in Brussels this autumn and it's

72
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,140
important that there are political

73
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,440
deliverables at this summit it is

74
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,279
mentioned in the wrong declaration which

75
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,560
came out spring of this year March it

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,770
says clearly that Europe should stay

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,130
open for partnerships based on the

78
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:55,620
values and for the countries who are

79
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,380
promoting committed to promote these

80
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,720
values so we hope very much that there

81
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,590
will be strong political statement

82
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,660
reiterating the same spirit also we

83
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:10,170
expect that there will be practical

84
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:14,370
deliverables to work through different

85
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:16,738
instruments to improve connectivity with

86
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,010
Europe to improve the infrastructure in

87
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,830
Georgia to improve education system and

88
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:26,360
also we think that security

89
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:31,198
cooperation is important we we are all

90
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:35,009
certain that having stable political

91
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,199
allies on the eastern flanks of Europe

92
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:42,389
is increasingly important

93
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,820
so CSDP and cooperation under CSDP is

94
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:49,169
increasingly important Georgia is not

95
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:52,370
only a consumer of security today but we

96
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:56,159
are provider of security we are part of

97
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:59,460
Afghanistan operation result support

98
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,470
nation we are in crisis management

99
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,469
operations in Central African Republic

100
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,020
and Mali and we are committed to be

101
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:11,370
present everywhere we're a civilized

102
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:15,570
world deems important to engage in the

103
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,150
peacekeeping and making regions and

104
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:23,159
countries stable so we think that these

105
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:25,138
three dimensions create a paradigm which

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,030
will be very important for upcoming

107
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:29,250
years for Georgia to follow and for

108
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,109
Ukraine we are very glad about Ukraine

109
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,389
success of visa liberalization and

110
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:38,120
success of Ukraine and Georgia and

111
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:41,909
Moldova are absolutely interrelated so

112
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,490
we think that for instant partnership

113
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:47,909
countries to keep consistency on this

114
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:50,099
road and to stay strongly committed to

115
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,630
this road is extremely important thank

116
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:53,219
you very much mr. mr. prime minister I

117
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:55,349
want to turn to two Ukrainian foreign

118
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,500
minister public Lincoln now President

119
00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:00,630
President Petro poroshenko upon the upon

120
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,490
Winnie when the visa liberalisation was

121
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,159
was finalized said and I'm quoting

122
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,990
Ukraine is coming home strangers coming

123
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:08,520
home to Europe I wonder if you could

124
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,639
elaborate on that a little bit what does

125
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,909
this mean and what's next for Ukraine in

126
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,250
this in this road home to Europe good

127
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:22,860
morning everyone and of course I can

128
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:26,190
support what gurgi has just said but I

129
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,580
believe and I really believe that the

130
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,310
whole point about the title of our panel

131
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,889
is really misleading both of the sense

132
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,820
of message but also in the sense of

133
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,410
terminology

134
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:43,950
you know the point about neighborhood I

135
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:48,690
very much hope is over from the early

136
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:51,650
90s the division in Europe was basically

137
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:54,990
set in the sense of division between

138
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:59,250
Europe and the former former Soviet

139
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:03,780
Union this division is oh it won't come

140
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,550
back and the sooner the West and

141
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,419
Dominion of the whole transatlantic

142
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:12,660
community gets the point that we are

143
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:15,450
also the indispensable part of the

144
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,540
transatlantic community not only in the

145
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,520
sense of you know somehow consuming

146
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,920
security like the wreckage has just said

147
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,810
but also you know providing the security

148
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:30,030
in many senses the better and of course

149
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,760
you know we we met a for Russia because

150
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,549
without Ukraine the whole understanding

151
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:39,599
of Russian project how it's shaping up I

152
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:42,300
believe is is not there in the sense of

153
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:46,170
legacy historic legacy Orthodox legacy

154
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,480
whatever but in the sense of further

155
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:52,490
steps of course we have very clear

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:56,040
vision and we should be included in

157
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:59,280
European space and transatlantic space

158
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,520
in the sense of security in the sense of

159
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,469
economy and our next goal in the sense

160
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,690
of European integration is very clear

161
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:10,350
it's about four freedoms we have to

162
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:14,040
embrace four freedoms and on this basis

163
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:18,720
we we have to go in a very consistent

164
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:22,650
way towards the reality to a week we we

165
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,690
actually be launcher and if you see is a

166
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,479
historical perspective if you see it in

167
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:30,030
political and economic perspective this

168
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,060
sooner we gonna stop talking about

169
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:36,419
neighborhood and this division which is

170
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:39,359
definitely over so better and the

171
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,598
division now is about values and about

172
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,730
commitment to democracy and of course

173
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,740
rule of law and this division will be

174
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,940
there and we have to recognize this

175
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,520
division

176
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,080
we have with somebody here somebody who

177
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,699
has gone through this experience that

178
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
Georgia and Ukraine are going through

179
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,520
now I'm referring of course the Foreign

180
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,220
Minister of Latvia and Guardian

181
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,110
Cambridge's um for foreign minister lien

182
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,780
kvish what can you offer what advice can

183
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,310
you offer our Ukrainian and our Georgian

184
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,050
colleagues and our Moldovan colleagues

185
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,459
who are not present on the panel as they

186
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,130
as they go along this road to Europe you

187
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,380
did it your Baltic colleagues did it in

188
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:15,420
Estonia in Lithuania people didn't think

189
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,040
you could do it I remember the attitudes

190
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,020
in the early 90s that this was this was

191
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,760
an impossible dream for Latvia Lithuania

192
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,860
and Estonia to integrate with the

193
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,180
European Union yet you did it you said

194
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,100
yes we can when everybody said no you

195
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,140
can't what advice would you offer to our

196
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,820
Georgian Ukrainian colleagues here well

197
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,620
thank you very much first of all I want

198
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,210
to congratulate our Georgian and

199
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,070
Ukrainian friends that with a

200
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,160
liberalisation that we politically

201
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:42,420
decided at Riga summit two years ago

202
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,370
finally has come true and it was a bit

203
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,610
kind of disappointing sometimes wrote

204
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,150
that it didn't come earlier but actually

205
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:54,270
what we have seen is that if Ukraine and

206
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,949
Georgia delivers then also EU must

207
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,560
deliver even if sometimes it's really

208
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:02,400
difficult to get the agreement around

209
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:06,209
currently 28 where is 127 if we look at

210
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,670
our experience I think that of course we

211
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:11,670
had a totally different environment it

212
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:14,550
was beginning of 90s it was throughout

213
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,709
90s when there was some kind of historic

214
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,750
and moral sense of responsibility on the

215
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:21,330
part of EU there was a clear perspective

216
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:26,130
for those countries that want to join

217
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:28,470
you that they will we had much let's say

218
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:30,810
better situation in our both thousand

219
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,450
and eastern neighborhood and it was not

220
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,849
so much struggling with its internal and

221
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,520
external issues so from that point of

222
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,620
view if you ask me that question a

223
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,990
couple of years ago I would be telling a

224
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,110
long list of reforms it should be done

225
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:49,110
right now I think that Georgia Ukraine

226
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,850
other countries of so-called Eastern

227
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,190
Partnership especially those who have

228
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,670
signed association agreements know very

229
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:00,030
well what they should do my advice would

230
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,650
be to have strategic patience it is

231
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:03,720
absolutely clear that

232
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,329
European membership is not going to come

233
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,560
in a year two or even five or probably

234
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,720
ten however what we did particularly

235
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,569
taking into account that skepticism that

236
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,350
was in many European capitals we did our

237
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:21,600
best not to be rejected because by the

238
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,000
way in the United States during our NATO

239
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,190
integration many congressmen were asking

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,980
are they like us meaning are their

241
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,380
values like US values the same question

242
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:34,050
was in Europe so I think that one thing

243
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:37,650
is continued developing country to the

244
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:40,170
point where even the most skeptical EU

245
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:45,240
member state cannot say that you are not

246
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:47,130
qualified second I think that sometimes

247
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,050
in the past and unfortunately they have

248
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:51,300
been some countries especially Moldova

249
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,430
there were many promises before you

250
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,859
promised think if you can deliver but if

251
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,410
you have promised and delivered the

252
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,200
third don't blame Brussels that was the

253
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:03,540
biggest mistake we had because you do

254
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,310
the reform process for the sake of your

255
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:08,130
country not for the sake of the Brussels

256
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,410
bureaucracy or European bureaucracy and

257
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,360
I think that we are still back home

258
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:14,969
struggling with that kind of situation

259
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,830
that every success is success of

260
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,680
national politics every failure is a

261
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,500
failure of of European politics and my

262
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,770
final point I think that what we need

263
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,540
definitely do and as I know that our

264
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,150
Ukrainian and Georgian friends are doing

265
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,670
a lot we still have to struggle to keep

266
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,670
European attention an equal attention

267
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,529
also to the Eastern Partnership

268
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:40,589
countries to Association partnership

269
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:43,080
countries I very much agree that while

270
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,180
we are very much talking about article

271
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,330
50 the most famous article of Lisbon

272
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,969
treaty so far which is about exit we

273
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:53,250
also have to keep reminding about the

274
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,200
article 49 which is about entry and

275
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,980
that's the job that we should do

276
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,130
together those who are friends of off of

277
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,600
Ukraine Georgia Moldova as well as

278
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:06,240
Ukrainians and Georgians and moderates

279
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,550
should should keep reminding about their

280
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,520
success and should keep doing the good

281
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,530
job back home now when we talk about the

282
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,270
European neighborhood it's impossible as

283
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:17,490
much as some would like to that

284
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:19,500
term to to be relegated to the dustbin

285
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:22,380
of history it's impossible not to talk

286
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,230
about the Russian Federation and I want

287
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,520
to turn now to viatra Slovenian Ave

288
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,920
deputy with the Russians within the

289
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,020
Russian State Duma to ask this question

290
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,189
because when I was working and living in

291
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,870
Russia throughout the 90s one of the

292
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,010
mantras I would hear from Russian

293
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,460
officials and this was in the very

294
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,750
heated period when NATO is enlarging

295
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,880
initially to include the Czech Republic

296
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,740
Poland and Hungary and the argument I

297
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,870
heard repeatedly from Russian officials

298
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,270
at that time was we don't have a problem

299
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:52,200
with the European Union we have a

300
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:57,540
problem with NATO now some time around I

301
00:13:52,200 --> 00:14:00,450
don't know 2012 2013 2014 that that line

302
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,579
changed and suddenly it appears maybe

303
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,230
you can correct me here if I'm wrong but

304
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,600
it appears to me and it appears to many

305
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,720
that Russia now has a problem with the

306
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,670
enlargement of the European Union and I

307
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,200
wanted to ask ourselves a bitch I want

308
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,760
to ask you basically point-blank does

309
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,950
the Russian Federation have problem with

310
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,750
the European Union enlarging to

311
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,500
integrate Russia's neighbors including

312
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,980
Ukraine Georgia and Moldova Thank You

313
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,000
chair

314
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:30,120
good morning actually the short answer

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,570
to your question is no but I would like

316
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,890
also to start with questioning a

317
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,180
question to the audience what is the

318
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,180
largest European city

319
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:51,790
you would be right if not to count the

320
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:54,449
Asian part of Istanbul so what is the

321
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:56,640
largest European city

322
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,770
it's called Moscow

323
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,130
it's called Moscow Moscow is much bigger

324
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:05,350
than London and actually that is just to

325
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,450
change your perspective a little bit

326
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,370
after this it would be easier for you to

327
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,370
answer the question what is the largest

328
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,660
European country

329
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:21,370
it's called Russia but when the word

330
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:22,150
Europe is pronounced in Berlin in Paris

331
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,330
and London

332
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,819
you don't mean Russia and I think that

333
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:30,580
was the biggest mistake made after the

334
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,710
end of the Cold War because I think at

335
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,800
this time there was a golden opportunity

336
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,720
to create an you the new European

337
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,240
architecture which would embrace

338
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,610
everybody which would embrace Latvia

339
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:48,700
crane Georgia Russia and creating a new

340
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:52,090
undivided Europe common European home as

341
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:56,350
comrade Gorbachev used to say and I used

342
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:59,770
to work for his team you know instead of

343
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,990
that there was another paradigm of

344
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,329
expanding institutions which were

345
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:09,160
inherited from the times of the Cold War

346
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:13,630
and the whole European new European

347
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,689
construction was a without Russia and in

348
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,360
many instances against Russia so we were

349
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:23,280
treated as outsiders in that process and

350
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:29,980
what we've got now is the clear result

351
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:31,660
of that decision to keep Russia out that

352
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,850
was one of the functions of native

353
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,510
forever from the beginning and it

354
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:41,530
continues to be so and that's why we've

355
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,900
got quite a few symmetries they are in

356
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:47,079
perceptions and but they are also in in

357
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,490
geopolitics we're speaking about Eastern

358
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,550
neighborhood what is this neighborhood

359
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:56,280
for Russia for us it's

360
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:59,459
Shanghai Cooperation Organization which

361
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:02,939
now includes also India and Pakistan for

362
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:05,130
us it's Eurasian Union with Belarus

363
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:10,380
Kazakhstan Armenia Tajikistan and

364
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:13,620
Kyrgyzstan ization which which adds

365
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,170
becca Stan its BRICS Brazil Russia India

366
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:19,649
China South Africa which accounts for

367
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:22,410
44% of the global population for us it's

368
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:27,150
a pact for us it's East Asia summits for

369
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:30,090
us it's ASEAN plus for us it's a Zeon

370
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,820
Regional Forum and many other things we

371
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:39,060
have many many partnerships being so

372
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:42,870
isolated in this world and you know this

373
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,320
is a geographic asymmetry speaking in a

374
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,610
narrow terms about the partnership the

375
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:53,399
Eastern Partnership in the terms of the

376
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:57,240
European Union here we have a symmetry

377
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,620
in the definition of success because for

378
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,080
Russia of course the definition of

379
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,750
success and dealing with the neighbors

380
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:08,330
is to make them as friendly to Russia as

381
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:11,340
possible the definition of success of

382
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,960
many people sitting in this room is how

383
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,520
to distance those countries from Russia

384
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:22,530
and I think these are conflicting goals

385
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:25,590
we cannot really put this together we

386
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,629
see once after another the instances

387
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,600
when the country is saying we are going

388
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:35,150
to become part of NATO European Union it

389
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:38,550
is also becoming quite Russa phobic

390
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,320
which goes hand in hand so for us it's

391
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:47,070
we have very mixed feelings about this

392
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:49,350
process of enlargement see do we regard

393
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,840
these countries as sovereign of course

394
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,560
because that was Russia's deliberate

395
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,120
decision to make them sovereign do they

396
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,960
have the right to enter the European

397
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,169
Union

398
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,400
yes as for NATO I would disagree that

399
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:07,280
these arguments about native gone the

400
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,480
they are still there because for us NATO

401
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:15,610
is not something which is perceived here

402
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,190
because it's a military alliance

403
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:22,490
spending three-quarters of the global

404
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:25,670
defence money and now planning to expand

405
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,410
that figure which which was very well

406
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:31,070
expressed that this conference is

407
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:34,850
regarding Russia is on top of the enemy

408
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:37,540
list and which is actually bringing its

409
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:42,800
military machine closer to our borders

410
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:45,740
over over 800 American military points

411
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,159
of presence I would put it this way 400

412
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:51,800
are her own Russian borders and some of

413
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:54,320
them have nuclear weapons so for us is

414
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,990
it's also a matter of national security

415
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,480
not just for the countries sitting there

416
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:02,740
and Russia had a long term experience

417
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:06,470
with dealing with with the West

418
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,800
including the combined West which was

419
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:13,580
not oftentimes very productive and

420
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:16,460
sometimes very destructive and now about

421
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,560
the sovereignty Russia is one of the two

422
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:21,770
countries with 500 years of sovereign

423
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,980
existence the second being England which

424
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:27,680
has a less troubled neighborhood so we

425
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:31,580
have our strong sense of sovereignty

426
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,410
statehood there and we'll have it we're

427
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,830
going to stay as an independent center

428
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,920
of power

429
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:39,919
we are not going we're not interested in

430
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,530
being integrated anywhere we are not

431
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,870
going to give up our sovereignty to - to

432
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:47,629
the European Union or NATO which is

433
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,060
inevitable in the European Union on NATO

434
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,230
we're not interested in that not this

435
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:54,560
time

436
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,910
we accept the right of others to join at

437
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,610
the same time we understand that

438
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:01,370
European Union is not just a blessing

439
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,620
it's also responsibility it's also a key

440
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,830
community which I consider not the most

441
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:11,270
exciting reading and what not the most

442
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:13,460
business-friendly document it's that the

443
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,129
European Union is the slowest developing

444
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,620
part of the world that the countries

445
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,020
which are aspiring for the

446
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,179
being Union actually economically doing

447
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,180
not as good as the countries which are

448
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,640
not you know when the Soviet Union was

449
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,610
falling apart Georgia and Ukraine and

450
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,490
Latvia had living standards much higher

451
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:36,070
than in Russia Belarus of Kazakhstan

452
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:38,710
today Ukraine has living standard I

453
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,510
would counted three to four five times

454
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,800
lower than and the Russian Federation

455
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:47,800
and probably three times then in Belarus

456
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:50,350
Kazakhstan Georgia doing better than

457
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:53,740
Ukraine but also have it much lower in

458
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,959
GDP per capita than Russia Belarus of

459
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,710
Kazakhstan and latter which was doing

460
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,260
much better than the Russian Federation

461
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,090
is now doing almost the same as the

462
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,920
Russian Federation so it doesn't mean

463
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,830
that even joining the European Union

464
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,110
means you're going to develop faster

465
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,159
than the Russia which economy's in

466
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:18,550
shambles because of the sanctions so an

467
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:23,140
and final point about NATO expansion

468
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:25,059
NATO our borders at some point I heard

469
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:29,320
from the Russian military and I think

470
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:34,480
they're right if US forces NATO forces

471
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:40,020
are were in the Crimea and eastern

472
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:45,150
Ukraine Russia is undefendable

473
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:48,970
militarily in the case of conflict

474
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:51,940
without using nuclear weapons at the

475
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,290
early stage of the conflict and of

476
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,970
course

477
00:22:53,290 --> 00:23:00,010
god bless us from from any conflict

478
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:04,690
especially with the use of some you know

479
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:08,640
sophisticated weapons so the answer to

480
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:11,290
your question are we for membership for

481
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:16,690
Georgia and Ukraine in the European

482
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:18,760
Union yes would we like them if you

483
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,510
surprised I think your support is you

484
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:25,470
just surprised a lot of people sir yes

485
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:29,290
you're not against that if they want

486
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:31,350
it's a it's it's as if they wish they

487
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,350
can

488
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:36,530
do like Ukraine and Georgia be part of

489
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,870
NATO the answer is no but it's their

490
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,629
sovereign choice but you can understand

491
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,899
that for Russia this is a clear and

492
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:47,000
logical position we do not consider that

493
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,790
being good for Russian national

494
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,820
interests and very good for European

495
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:55,070
global security so we are looking from

496
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,760
the of course our angle is somewhat

497
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:01,939
different from what is common in this

498
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,960
room but we are also a sovereign country

499
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:08,870
with our national interests I actually

500
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,700
want to give Pavel klinken a opportunity

501
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,469
to very briefly it's pleased to read to

502
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,330
respond to that please I think mr.

503
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,800
Nichkhun have just surprised a lot of

504
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,350
people and I think you are probably the

505
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,840
most surprised person in the room given

506
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,659
that Ukraine is currently in a in a war

507
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,899
with with the Russian Federation

508
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:30,740
actually not really but I like I like

509
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:33,200
the point about being for our membership

510
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,270
and there at the Union but at the same

511
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,270
time saying that it's against Russian

512
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,280
national interests somehow for me it's

513
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,200
sort of conundrum you know nobody but

514
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,620
not not commercially well I didn't say

515
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:48,860
that I said that European Union is okay

516
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:52,280
but we have some reservations about NATO

517
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:56,240
ah so join and zero peon Union is

518
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,670
already okay so well to two simple

519
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,650
points the first one in the sense of

520
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:07,340
comment you know Russia European country

521
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:11,030
I do believe Russia was European country

522
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,580
and Moscow may be considered in some

523
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,129
reality as European city but it's

524
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,020
definitely not anymore in my

525
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:22,820
understanding because if you play with

526
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:25,960
geography it's fine but you know for me

527
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:30,320
the real division is about people and

528
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:33,860
it's about their values if you can see

529
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,100
the key if in Moscow now is you know

530
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:39,590
completely two different walls so in the

531
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:42,340
sense of reality we have in Russia

532
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,230
Russia is not European reality

533
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:48,260
definitely not European reality anymore

534
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:52,130
and this division between the former

535
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:54,950
Soviet Union like I said and between 0pn

536
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:58,549
Union is not there anymore

537
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:03,919
the second point very simple one go into

538
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:06,559
Europe for us is is a point of going

539
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,480
back to Europe how we understand our

540
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,928
history and how we understand our

541
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:16,780
vocation and it is not a point of saying

542
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:20,020
whether Europe could grow at 2% or 5%

543
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:23,809
its simply go into Europe how we

544
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:27,950
understand it anta gate it's not a point

545
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:30,010
of considering whether it's for the

546
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,890
Russian national interest or against the

547
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:40,030
irrational national interest for me the

548
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:43,030
whole success of Ukraine and Georgia has

549
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:45,918
European and democratic countries is a

550
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:49,000
total negation of the Russian project

551
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,020
how we have it in front of our eyes I

552
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,240
personally believe that the Russian

553
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,480
project for you know in the long run is

554
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,030
not sustainable but in the sense of

555
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,240
division in the sense of saying what is

556
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,809
European and not European I believe we

557
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,309
need to use our understanding and our

558
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:09,980
understanding is about something

559
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:13,940
completely different and probably last

560
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:19,340
very very simple point if you measure

561
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:23,960
success of Russian policy or whatever by

562
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:26,860
you know somehow having a sort of

563
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,880
neighborhood which is friendly to Russia

564
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:37,178
so you know let's see the whole circle

565
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:41,780
of countries around fashion can we have

566
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:45,320
relations based on trust or on any kind

567
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,660
of set of values in the foreseeable

568
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,809
future with Russia the answer is

569
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,450
definitely no the answer for Georgia you

570
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:57,920
know it's a point for forgive a so

571
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:02,050
basically invading Ukraine Russia

572
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:06,080
Russia made as a sort of fundamental

573
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:08,000
problem for the whole history of Russian

574
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,020
project and it should be clearly

575
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,080
understood also in Moscow but if you

576
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,770
talk to the people there it's it's not

577
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:22,070
it's not rational because many many

578
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:26,330
people simply can't perceive and see us

579
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:28,429
as Ukrainians and not as a part of the

580
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:31,010
previous reality if the sooner it's

581
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,190
going to stop it simply the better and I

582
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:37,040
believe it's it's also for Russia

583
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:39,590
because our success will have sort of

584
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,909
transformative effect also for Russia I

585
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:43,340
very much hope so

586
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:45,440
thank you very much I want to want to

587
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,860
bring the United States enter in today

588
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,690
in respond afterwards yeah yeah I would

589
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,979
ompletely to come back to come back to

590
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,570
you but I also wanted to bring the

591
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,900
United States and to into the

592
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:59,200
conversation here Andrea Thompson the

593
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,280
for the past three u.s. administration's

594
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,990
Georgia and Ukraine the so-called

595
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,450
European neighborhood has been a

596
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:08,540
priority in policy not always the top

597
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,190
priority but a priority with the current

598
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:13,520
administration there are some concerns

599
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:15,710
in the region that it will not be such a

600
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,710
priority for this administration what

601
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,300
could you say to that first Brian in

602
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,040
good morning and thank you and for the

603
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,840
group here for the for the conference I

604
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:25,220
just want to thank you from the

605
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,770
President and from my boss the vice

606
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:29,630
president for the opportunity to join a

607
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,580
kind of an interesting point when I look

608
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,170
across the room here and particularly to

609
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,610
the gentleman to my right when you asked

610
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,720
about the priorities of this

611
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:42,040
administration I've had dialogue with

612
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,990
with three of them and two of them have

613
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,850
met with with my boss and with in with

614
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,560
the president so I think that's pretty

615
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,199
telling indicator of the importance of

616
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:54,139
Georgia and the Ukraine for President

617
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,890
Trump in this administration we've been

618
00:29:54,140 --> 00:30:00,080
very very clear on our priorities we've

619
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:02,930
been steadfast in our relationships with

620
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,850
both with Georgia and the Ukraine that

621
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:08,030
we support their sovereignty and

622
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:09,649
territorial integrity we've as you've

623
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,840
discussed this morning on the gains

624
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,010
they've made with laud them as well

625
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,049
on the efforts you know set by the

626
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:18,250
example early on by the Baltic States on

627
00:30:15,049 --> 00:30:20,389
on reforms and moving forward and now

628
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,700
recently with both Ukraine and Georgia

629
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,559
with the democratic ideals that we

630
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,029
represent represent globally represent

631
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,010
with the United States with represent

632
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:30,679
with our friends in this room on what

633
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:33,408
can be done when you tend your eye

634
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,090
towards democracy to put that foot

635
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:37,640
forward independence and ideals and the

636
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,799
values that we represent so absolutely

637
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,390
it's a priority for this administration

638
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,850
again we've we've met with the vice

639
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,870
president our first trip out of the

640
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:47,389
gates was to the Munich Security

641
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,949
Conference now heading to Europe very

642
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,409
important message for the administration

643
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,799
on the importance of the relationships

644
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:56,750
met with met with President poroshenko

645
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,720
that in that venue has had continued

646
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,580
calls and engagements and again with

647
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,100
their friends of Georgia have had had

648
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:07,309
visits in in Washington DC in the Oval

649
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,689
Office so again this is mega dad it's

650
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:10,610
well though the reforms that have made

651
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,500
it's continued it's it's it's a journey

652
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,029
it's a it's a journey needs to be taken

653
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,860
so we'll continue to partner we'll

654
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:18,590
continue to be partners in this journey

655
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,049
forward with democratic ideals with the

656
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,090
reforms with their work towards EU and

657
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:24,889
opening the door into NATO it's not

658
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,320
going does it definitely top one of the

659
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,850
top priorities for the administration

660
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,649
sticking with you for the moment under

661
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,928
in terms I wanted to push on something

662
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:34,789
else that's been kind of out there this

663
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:36,950
idea of some kind of a grand bargain

664
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:39,169
between the United States and Russia you

665
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:42,559
see this alluded to in the Russian press

666
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:45,970
all the time and the implication is some

667
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,529
kind of Yalta 2.0 if you will and that

668
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,600
the United States in Russia would make a

669
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:52,279
deal over the heads of the Ukrainians

670
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,049
and the Georgians which we could sign

671
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:55,820
could consign Ukraine and Georgia to a

672
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:58,399
to a Russian sphere of influence in the

673
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,710
former Soviet space you're smiling mr.

674
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,029
Nikolov but you you know what I'm

675
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:09,710
talking about can you can you get

676
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:12,380
actually not what how would the United

677
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:15,289
States relate to such a proposal the the

678
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,850
short answers there is no grand deal the

679
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:19,460
future of Georgia the future of Ukraine

680
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,709
will be decided by the people of Georgia

681
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,409
and the people of Ukraine with our

682
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,639
support with our assistance you've seen

683
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:28,009
the relationship and

684
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:30,769
stability and security we have found

685
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:33,469
historically when the United States and

686
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:35,570
Europe are peaceful and prosperous that

687
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:38,779
peace and prosperity extends to the rest

688
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,908
of the globe so there will be no grand

689
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:44,419
bargains no sphere of influence

690
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,950
again this we've responded the the

691
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,169
territorial integrity and sovereignty of

692
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,029
both countries we stand firm with that

693
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:54,049
you've heard the president and the vice

694
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:57,440
president speak that we uphold the Minsk

695
00:32:54,049 --> 00:33:00,408
agreement we uphold that there needs to

696
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,679
remove the military footprint in eastern

697
00:33:00,409 --> 00:33:05,869
Ukraine the occupation in Georgia and

698
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,369
restore those borders back to the

699
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:09,379
rightful owners so there will be no

700
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:10,158
grand bargain from the United States ok

701
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:12,468
I know

702
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,719
Prime Minister critics really you wanted

703
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:18,639
to jump in here with with a remark yes

704
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:21,739
very briefly I will not elaborate about

705
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:27,079
everything what mr. Nicanor just said I

706
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:31,039
will only briefly say them Georgia is no

707
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:34,658
longer a post country I think we need to

708
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:38,059
get rid of these post policies' we are

709
00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:41,509
we are a country which can be easily

710
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:44,299
called Eastern European country we are

711
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:47,179
no longer a post Soviet country we have

712
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:50,899
one of the lowest corruption including

713
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:53,179
lower than in many European countries we

714
00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:56,029
have one of the best business climates

715
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:58,029
in the world we are number 16 according

716
00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:00,679
the World Bank's Doing Business ranking

717
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:04,219
according to the Heritage Foundation we

718
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:06,559
are 13th freest economy in the world and

719
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:09,109
our indicators are improving

720
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,480
year-on-year and our democratic

721
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:13,788
institutions are very strong and our

722
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:16,809
rule of law is improving every year and

723
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:20,440
we are absolutely in line with our

724
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:25,809
association agenda and the action plan

725
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:29,480
envisaged by the agenda so calling again

726
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:32,419
supporting Georgia's European

727
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:37,699
aspirations and being against the NATO

728
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:38,779
aspirations are absolutely senseless

729
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:42,138
because we

730
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,540
seventy percent more than 70% of

731
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:47,929
Georgian population favors NATO

732
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:51,100
integration more than 80% of Georgia's

733
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:54,679
population favors EU integration and we

734
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:57,589
are for value-based integration and we

735
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,530
believe that these goals will be

736
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:04,910
fulfilled with consistency and

737
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:07,220
dedication now Russia supports Georgia's

738
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:11,029
EU integration what is giorgia for

739
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:14,720
Russia this is the main question what is

740
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:17,570
the map of Georgia or what is the

741
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,730
country they are talking about so this

742
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:23,750
is the biggest question and I'm sorry

743
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:26,680
that I'm mentioning about the lower pace

744
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:30,410
of economic growth of the country's

745
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:34,299
stability of which is undermined by the

746
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:38,180
Russian intervention sounds a very very

747
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,170
sarcastic I'm sorry to say that mr.

748
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:45,919
Nikolov would you like to respond to

749
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:50,630
that well actually when I was talking

750
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,330
about the idea of expanding European

751
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,880
Union and NATO I said that we do not

752
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:58,640
have any objections to the European

753
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,620
Union actually the whole issue I think

754
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,900
was raised then we had you insisted on

755
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,670
negotiations with Ukraine when it wanted

756
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,890
to sign the association agreement with

757
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:12,530
the European Union for understandable

758
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:15,350
reason because at this point Russia was

759
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,850
the biggest economic partner for Ukraine

760
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:18,319
and Ukraine was one of the biggest

761
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,720
economic partners for the Russian

762
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,190
Federation and so when you open the

763
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,339
border with the European Union you

764
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:27,200
shouldn't negotiate what happens in

765
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,290
Russia Ukraine trade which is

766
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,240
understandable because we were in one

767
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:34,400
customs situation and the Ukraine after

768
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,009
the association agreement is going in

769
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,060
another direction so we had to

770
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:42,770
renegotiate the the trade agreements and

771
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,130
that was perceived as Russia's

772
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:48,259
opposition to Ukraine going to - to the

773
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:51,350
European Union and was one of the

774
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:56,420
reasons of the revolution against

775
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:59,029
against Yanukovych you see we're here

776
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:02,030
also speaking about sovereignty and

777
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:05,180
sovereign rights the sovereignty of the

778
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:10,160
people is something which i think is

779
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:12,140
really very important and the new russia

780
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,580
after perestroika after the end of the

781
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:19,640
Cold War decided that the nations of

782
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:22,009
Latvia Ukraine Georgia have their

783
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,560
sovereign rights to to become

784
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:27,550
independent states and that's what

785
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,700
happened that gave birth to fourteen new

786
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:34,690
independent states but then we found out

787
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:37,189
those that those artificial borders

788
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:40,160
administrative Morison inside the Soviet

789
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:42,500
Union did not reflect certain realities

790
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,109
in certain ethnic realities certain

791
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,180
historic realities and and then raise

792
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:50,420
the question on where there are other

793
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:53,299
people not just living in the former

794
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,760
republics have the but in the autonomous

795
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,120
republics have also their right to

796
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,770
create the nation states that was the

797
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,500
questions for a settings that was a

798
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,509
question for Hodgins that was a question

799
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,420
for it for the Chechens that was the

800
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:11,180
question for people in the Russians in

801
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,220
the Crimea of Russia in his new crane

802
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,890
and so the question is whether they also

803
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,379
have their sovereign right we know that

804
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,819
the international law has complained

805
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:24,080
conflicting principle of territorial

806
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:28,580
integrity and sovereignty of the nations

807
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:31,549
- well I think it's a pretty unambiguous

808
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,870
oh the borders of the among the

809
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,210
post-soviet states I don't think there's

810
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:37,430
much room for interpretation here so it

811
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:40,400
was quite a it is quite ambiguous but

812
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:43,669
when you know when the United Nations

813
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,860
and international law were invade

814
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:51,440
invented back in 1945 there were only 50

815
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:56,150
nation states on earth and today there

816
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:58,970
are 192 UN members and each of these

817
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:00,380
states was created as a realization of

818
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:04,459
this principle of national

819
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:07,760
self-determination so these in turn

820
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:12,710
is quite vague in that situation and so

821
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:16,580
the sovereign rights of the Kosovars the

822
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:19,100
Chechens the set hands the Russians in

823
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:21,620
the Crimea are you waiting the rights of

824
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:27,370
the Chechens in Russians in Crimea did I

825
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:29,900
hear that uh well III think I think the

826
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:32,900
what Yeltsin did in Chechnya was a big

827
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,550
mistake and what I am saying actually

828
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:39,650
what I'm going to say if you want to

829
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:43,840
keep your territorial integrity regard

830
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:46,760
your own domestic policies because

831
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:51,590
Soviet when the Soviet Union had the

832
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:54,530
problems with some Republic's which are

833
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:58,340
eager to secede the probably the problem

834
00:39:54,530 --> 00:40:01,370
was inside the Soviet Union when

835
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,710
Americans decided to become independent

836
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:04,910
from the British Empire probably there

837
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,710
were some problems with the British

838
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:12,830
Empire not just with you know French

839
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:15,500
intervention the same here if there were

840
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:17,299
problems with settings and the presence

841
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,200
in Georgia probably was something wrong

842
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:25,310
in Georgia not just foreign intervention

843
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:28,879
and now I think the key to solving the

844
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:30,710
situation in Donbass forever try to

845
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:33,140
engage those people that something we

846
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:36,200
learned in Chechnya by the way because

847
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,240
if you just fighting there or you

848
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:44,569
cutting supplies which we never did

849
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:46,759
actually in Chechnya or just having no

850
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,340
dialogue with those people there is no

851
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,520
way you can engage them you cannot there

852
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:55,370
is no way to bring them back and this

853
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,020
dialogue with the Chechens actually

854
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,420
brought to the situation where there is

855
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,860
no secession crisis in Chechnya there

856
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,740
any problems there but there is no

857
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:06,530
secession crisis in Chechnya because we

858
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,970
engage them Yeltsin brought them to to

859
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,700
the Kremlin

860
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,560
you know to talk to that's a very broad

861
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,270
definition to the term engage really

862
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,950
would think I would say but but I mean

863
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,540
it sir sir sir sir seems to me what

864
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,850
you're saying in whatever way

865
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:22,670
engaged talk to them talk to them

866
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:25,430
because if you if you think there is a

867
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:27,920
solution for the situation in Georgia or

868
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:31,069
in Ukraine by talking with Moscow or

869
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,880
imposing sanctions on Moscow that is not

870
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:37,700
going to happen because well sanctions

871
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,610
do not work for sure yesterday I heard

872
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,350
that the recipe for making sanctions

873
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:45,680
more effective is making more sanctions

874
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,210
but it doesn't work

875
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,930
the only thing which happens in Russia

876
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:54,100
with the sessions is its of course makes

877
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:56,810
the life of the ruling party easier and

878
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,370
the nation our depression the nation

879
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,650
under pressure is uniting around the

880
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,839
flag and that's this was go what's going

881
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,400
on and we'll go you've certainly given

882
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,480
us a lot to think about it I want to ask

883
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,460
everybody begin to get their questions

884
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,140
ready I do want to give our panelists a

885
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,910
chances to make one to make final

886
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,259
comments and I understand the foreign

887
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:15,109
ministry and cabbage would like to make

888
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,150
a comment thank you very much I think

889
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:21,290
Paulo said it very clearly and I can

890
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:23,810
agree with him entirely that if you want

891
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:26,090
to speak about be part of Europe it's

892
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,430
not only Geographic issue but it's also

893
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,280
the issue of values however a couple of

894
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:33,350
points first of all I think that we all

895
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,960
should think about one big question that

896
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:38,810
was the issue back 20 years ago I think

897
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,330
it's the issue right now EU with all its

898
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,430
faults it's all its deficiencies is

899
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:47,660
still very attractive for the Balkan

900
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:49,460
region for our friends from Georgia and

901
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,910
Ukraine if you look at Russia actually

902
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:54,860
everyone is running away from the kind

903
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,420
of you know sphere of influence this

904
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,240
country wants to create I think that

905
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:01,670
brings a very good question second well

906
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,339
I do believe that I don't want to get

907
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:07,190
into discussion about statistics but

908
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,710
still back in Latvia we discuss not

909
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,510
about how to reach level of Russia we

910
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:13,880
are actually discussing how to reach

911
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:16,460
level of Nordic countries and still per

912
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,710
capita GDP is much higher in unlikely

913
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,210
than in Russia and this is something

914
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:23,600
what I would think that alternative

915
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:26,630
facts are not entirely correct here also

916
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:29,310
the final point look I think that there

917
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:32,280
is one mentality issue

918
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:37,290
mentality we continue speaking about the

919
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:43,320
former Soviet Union countries then we

920
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:45,570
get a situation where if we continue

921
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:48,270
speak about this event not about

922
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:50,730
countries that are independent that have

923
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:52,200
their own right to choose then we are in

924
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:55,770
trouble and that's an issue that we

925
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,379
become obsessed with when it comes to

926
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,420
the press we always refer to George or

927
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:02,700
Ukraine or whatever country that was

928
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,770
part of Soviet Union as former Soviet

929
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,120
republic we are not referring to the

930
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,670
United States of the former British

931
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,319
colony or something else I think this is

932
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:14,280
something that we should be very very

933
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:19,410
careful oh I do believe I do believe

934
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:22,080
that there is trouble and when I'm

935
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,839
hearing mr. McConnell saying that they

936
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:28,200
don't have objection for Georgia Ukraine

937
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,210
and Moldova becoming part of EU I had

938
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,629
talks with foreign minister Lavrov and

939
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:36,450
he said that Russia actually had quite

940
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:38,310
objection against association agreement

941
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,950
because they understood at some point

942
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:43,590
that the Baltic membership in European

943
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,060
Union is actually much more dangerous

944
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,150
when it comes to economic development

945
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:51,720
energy dependency and other things and

946
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,880
actually let's say all membership into

947
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,620
NATO that was discussion couple of years

948
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,990
ago and I think that this argument still

949
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,029
hold I knew mr. McConnell wants to

950
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:01,620
respond I want to also give the other

951
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,240
panelists a chance to say final words

952
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,000
before we go to questions so very

953
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,310
briefly please well those boring

954
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,080
professors like me they always bring

955
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:17,040
sources and this is the world in 2017 by

956
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:24,090
published by The Economist do you trust

957
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:25,650
this source no I have IMF World Bank the

958
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,800
United Nations there are no questions

959
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,570
yes even trusted sources and also the

960
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,350
data of the World Bank of International

961
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:36,990
Monetary Fund which brings Estonia and

962
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:42,390
Latvia somewhat higher Russia in the

963
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:44,939
exchange rate GDP but somewhat lower in

964
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:47,069
the rates of purchasing power parity

965
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,069
professor I also checked my source right

966
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:52,829
now that's I think we can always I can

967
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:55,440
always argue is different absolutely but

968
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:58,200
well we understand about statistics but

969
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,900
still I am F World Bank and the

970
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,689
economy's I think is there those are

971
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:10,140
quite reliable sources and I usually

972
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:12,529
base my figures on that solid basis okay

973
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,940
I want to give the final opportunity to

974
00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:17,640
Prime Minister critics really and

975
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:21,809
foreign minister klimkin to make remarks

976
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:24,868
before before we go to the audience well

977
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:29,490
first of all we are very enthusiastic

978
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:31,710
about future of Europe and we are very

979
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:35,069
enthusiastic because of the very clear

980
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:37,799
reason that Georgia is committed to

981
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:42,349
build a value based partnership with

982
00:46:37,799 --> 00:46:46,500
Europe of course European perspective is

983
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:50,039
something we aspire and we think this is

984
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:54,349
not unrealistic if we take the current

985
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:58,799
context it may sound unrealistic as

986
00:46:54,349 --> 00:47:02,519
Edgar said it may not happen tomorrow

987
00:46:58,799 --> 00:47:04,380
in two years five years but I would

988
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:07,288
disagree that it may not happen in ten

989
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:10,890
years I'm sorry I just

990
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:14,339
we Georgians are optimistic and when we

991
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:17,279
look at the headline of this panel I

992
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:19,920
would also as Paulo disagree I would

993
00:47:17,279 --> 00:47:23,240
also disagree with the panel because it

994
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:26,490
all depends on us it all depends on the

995
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,279
partnership we build it depends on the

996
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:31,890
commitment of the national governments

997
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:35,569
to the value based based partnership and

998
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:38,190
it all depends on abiding very basic

999
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:40,920
principles of territorial integrity and

1000
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:45,059
sovereignty in that case and if we do

1001
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:48,329
not abandon the wider Europe principle

1002
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:50,690
which is again based on the building new

1003
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:53,050
partnership based on values and

1004
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:56,080
promoting countries

1005
00:47:53,050 --> 00:48:01,540
committed to that partnerships I think

1006
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:05,110
that we can avoid major challenges in

1007
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:08,620
the future we can mitigate coming risks

1008
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:11,410
together again through the partnerships

1009
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,660
we built so we Georgians are optimistic

1010
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:17,740
about Europe's future and we are

1011
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:21,069
optimistic about our future and this is

1012
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:24,490
something that civilized world should

1013
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:26,530
respect turning to to foreign minister

1014
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:27,819
klimkin actually I think one things I

1015
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:30,550
want to say is that as I listen to the

1016
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,610
two of you speak Georgia and Ukraine

1017
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,180
create a really valuable

1018
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,950
counter-narrative I think the European

1019
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,299
Union was a great debt to both of your

1020
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:39,370
countries because you provide a very

1021
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,800
powerful counter narrative to the your

1022
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:43,720
skepticism that we see inside of much of

1023
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,450
the European Union if things are so bad

1024
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:50,560
in the EU why is it that Ukraine and

1025
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:54,819
Georgia are dying to get in well I think

1026
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:56,950
that a lot of times Europeans don't

1027
00:48:54,820 --> 00:49:00,550
appreciate with due respect to all of

1028
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:03,790
them achievements that have been made in

1029
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:08,800
the European Union this is the longest

1030
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:10,810
stable partnership that the countries

1031
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,650
engaged in European Union has have

1032
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:19,779
achieved I think that the reasons for

1033
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:21,850
the skepticism is mostly lie in problems

1034
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,900
coming from Middle Eastern crisis and

1035
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:28,540
the influx of refugees but I very much

1036
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:33,630
hope that again as I said through the

1037
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:36,880
partnership of the countries engaged in

1038
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:39,790
resolving these conflicts when these

1039
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:44,110
problems will fade away we very much

1040
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:46,870
hope that why the Europe spirit will

1041
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:49,150
revive and we will be Georgians

1042
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,529
Ukrainians will be part of that spirit

1043
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:54,270
foreign minister klimkin

1044
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:58,120
furniture to very quick terrific points

1045
00:49:54,270 --> 00:50:00,460
one we obviously have fundamental

1046
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:04,120
difference with Russia in understanding

1047
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:06,610
everything including of customary energy

1048
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:09,430
we understand sovereignty as a

1049
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:12,130
commitment to democracy and rule of law

1050
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:15,270
and of course following the basic

1051
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:18,880
principles of of international law

1052
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:21,520
Russia understands something completely

1053
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:25,420
different but basically we can discuss

1054
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:30,160
it for hours but in the sense of simple

1055
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:34,210
example can you imagine in Kiev in brief

1056
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:38,259
in Stockholm in Warsaw people erecting

1057
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:41,370
monuments for Stalin and laying flowers

1058
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:46,030
there including the Russian president

1059
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:47,410
it's the nature of division between us

1060
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:50,830
and them

1061
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:51,970
and this division is there it's it's the

1062
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,670
fact of life

1063
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:57,310
it's bury its we could consider it sort

1064
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:59,650
of good fair too bad fact but its effect

1065
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:03,190
of life and we have to live in this

1066
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:07,630
reality but coming back to the title of

1067
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:11,350
our our panel it's my my second point if

1068
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:16,120
the sooner we stop calling this reality

1069
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:19,480
neighborhood and into the whole the

1070
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:22,029
whole decision will be taken to include

1071
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:25,450
us in the transatlantic community and

1072
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:29,650
European space with all kind of efforts

1073
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:34,149
behind it the better and actually the

1074
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:39,070
point about Chum oil is also about us

1075
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:42,760
about Ukrainians Georgians and about you

1076
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:46,030
know making a delivery and and going

1077
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,490
forward so it's about us and it's about

1078
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:51,640
also solidarity because it would

1079
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:53,970
basically works for us in all these

1080
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,830
three years and the last one

1081
00:51:53,970 --> 00:52:00,189
Georgians end of consecration showed

1082
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:03,610
many times that we are ready to fight

1083
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:07,380
for for our understanding of Ukraine for

1084
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:12,580
our future Ukraine it was many times

1085
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:16,450
like on the Maidan or now in in the

1086
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:18,020
occupied bus so it's not about hundreds

1087
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:20,270
of people it's not about those

1088
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:23,350
of people it's about thousands and

1089
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:26,870
millions and it's the end of the day

1090
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:28,910
it's you know I don't like to use this

1091
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:31,040
bit of terminology but still it's a

1092
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:33,620
fundamental asset for for the whole

1093
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,529
transatlantic community people who

1094
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:39,890
understand what what they've been

1095
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:45,200
fighting for and ready ready to fight

1096
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:48,109
further and we can't simply breach this

1097
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:52,009
fundamental division because this

1098
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:53,450
fundamental diffusion is is there okay I

1099
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:56,300
finally I want to give Andrea Thompson

1100
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:57,680
you've been watching and I get a

1101
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,960
sneaking suspicion you'd like to make

1102
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:02,089
some very very brief final final remarks

1103
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:04,550
if I'm not mistaken though just like

1104
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:08,270
like to echo what Foreign Minister said

1105
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:10,250
the title of today's discussions with

1106
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:11,960
times of turmoil as we've seen I would

1107
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:14,390
challenge it which should be times of

1108
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,490
opportunity we've seen what happens when

1109
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:19,160
hard work with reform with dedication

1110
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:20,990
with effort for the for the peoples of

1111
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,910
the country again we've seen it but the

1112
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,790
Baltics we're seeing it now with the

1113
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:27,920
time of opportunity and I I think the

1114
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:30,140
future is very bright for my two

1115
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,280
partners to the right with the continued

1116
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,040
emphasis with the continued partnership

1117
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,020
that the opportunities for the people of

1118
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,759
Ukraine for the people of Georgia are

1119
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,440
it's an incredible time in our history

1120
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,820
and would just like to end with that

1121
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,930
thank you okay thank you and we're gonna

1122
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:44,000
go we're going to go to the audience for

1123
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,950
questions I want to ask everybody a keep

1124
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,870
your questions brief be make sure their

1125
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:51,200
questions I want to see a mark at the

1126
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:53,420
end of everything no speeches and seat

1127
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,220
address them to a specific member of the

1128
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,260
panel first I want to go to cut that

1129
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:59,390
inna method Nova of the European

1130
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,220
Commission because we've been talking

1131
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,810
about the European Union we have a

1132
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,680
representative from the Commission here

1133
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,570
who would like to take the first

1134
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,359
question from the floor thank you very

1135
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:10,520
much and apologies rather than question

1136
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,800
it's going to be a brief comment you get

1137
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,660
it you get a pass on that one

1138
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:17,060
thank you a deputy director-general in

1139
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:19,370
DG for neighborhood and enlargement

1140
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,650
negotiations and it's great to see you

1141
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:23,750
on the panel it's actually not only a

1142
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:26,750
very useful country narrative let's not

1143
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:29,540
forget that on Maidan and in the war

1144
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:30,990
that continues people of Ukraine are

1145
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:33,750
actually dying for your

1146
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:37,078
and I'm not sure we actually appreciate

1147
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:40,530
that sufficiently I have three brief

1148
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:42,569
remarks one is you talk prime foreign

1149
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:45,180
minister about strategic patience I like

1150
00:54:42,569 --> 00:54:47,069
the framing and I think what we owe to

1151
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,980
the countries of Eastern Partnership is

1152
00:54:47,069 --> 00:54:54,509
to provide strategic assistance and

1153
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:56,520
really try to help the reforms and help

1154
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:58,109
the Reformers in the countries and this

1155
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,059
is how we are looking at the Eastern

1156
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:03,390
Partnership summit in November where we

1157
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:06,089
are planning concrete deliverables to to

1158
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:09,660
help the process along second point mr.

1159
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:12,509
Nikolov I just would like to I

1160
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:14,879
understand your point about asymmetry of

1161
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,650
interests in European neighbourhood from

1162
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,480
the point of Russia and the EU I just

1163
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:21,599
would like to clarify a little bit it is

1164
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,880
not what we are trying to do in the East

1165
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,400
is to make the countries go as far away

1166
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:29,309
from Russia in fact the EU held

1167
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:32,550
trilateral talks many many many rounds

1168
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:34,950
with you and Ukraine when Ukraine was

1169
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:38,130
about to enter into the DC FTA those

1170
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:40,589
failed as as you know so what we are

1171
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,920
trying to do is support the reforms in

1172
00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:46,828
the country support the processes and

1173
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:50,520
one unfortunately unifying theme around

1174
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:54,119
the neighborhood is the open or frozen

1175
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:58,799
conflicts and the hybrid attacks that

1176
00:55:54,119 --> 00:56:02,190
they are under so I think it's not us

1177
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:04,319
trying to take them away from you or

1178
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:06,030
push them away from you it's it's is

1179
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,730
rather reacting to the reality and the

1180
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:11,130
third brief point on the on the question

1181
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:14,069
of GDP and the economists and the World

1182
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:16,170
Bank and IMF there is a very big

1183
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:19,740
difference between countries based on

1184
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,900
commodity oil and gas riches in the

1185
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,660
former Soviet Union those that don't and

1186
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:27,420
I think that the dynamism you see in the

1187
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:30,089
economy of Georgia is on the upward

1188
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:33,119
trend rather than what you have in in

1189
00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:35,009
Russia and the reforms that Ukraine the

1190
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,349
fundamental reforms that they have done

1191
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:40,079
in the banking energy sector public

1192
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:41,630
procurement etc speak well for the

1193
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,850
future thank

1194
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:46,580
Thank You Reena and I want to say

1195
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:48,020
Katrina got a pass being a member of the

1196
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:50,180
Commission has its privileges nobody

1197
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:51,950
else does questions please briefly the

1198
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,990
gentleman here you Liam Fatah from

1199
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:55,759
Romania I think the real elephant in the

1200
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:57,229
room is not Russia is China because

1201
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,660
geopolitics is changing fast due to

1202
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:01,220
globalization so my first question is

1203
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,589
how do you see increased presence of

1204
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:05,330
chain in our region because we don't

1205
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,710
talk about them enough but they are

1206
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,730
coming and the second question for our

1207
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,020
American friend do you have also

1208
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:11,420
Republic of Moldova on your list

1209
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:13,759
although they are not in the panel they

1210
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:18,530
are among the group with Georgia Ukraine

1211
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:21,410
thank you can you repeat can you repeat

1212
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:23,330
the first question it's about China but

1213
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:25,970
yes I think the real elephant in the

1214
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:27,529
room is China they increase their

1215
00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:30,230
presence in Central and Eastern Europe

1216
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:32,990
which was not the case in the past maybe

1217
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:36,470
or accepting of six up five five six

1218
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:41,209
hundred years ago and this is a factor

1219
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:45,080
who is changing their relations okay

1220
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:50,060
Moscow to respond to that well of course

1221
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:51,920
I can speak about China but when you

1222
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:56,150
want to say Central and Eastern Europe

1223
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:59,120
you also mean Russia or I sometimes it

1224
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:00,920
is missing the terminology here because

1225
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,750
what is Russia in your definitions for

1226
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,990
Eastern Europe it's not Europe or

1227
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:08,330
whatever but first of all of course I

1228
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:10,669
would like to react to what mr. klimkin

1229
00:58:08,330 --> 00:58:13,490
had to say about directing stallions

1230
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:15,560
monuments and Putin putting flowers to

1231
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:20,000
those monuments of course this is a

1232
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:22,400
known fact it has never happened then

1233
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,620
actually the difference there are some

1234
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,200
really fundamental differences and

1235
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:32,299
perceptions and then values between

1236
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:35,620
Russia and Ukraine and of course one of

1237
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:39,980
the facts is that many central streets

1238
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:43,990
in the cities of Ukraine have already

1239
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:46,730
been renamed after the Nazi criminals

1240
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:50,979
after people who are responsible for

1241
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:55,080
deaths of hundreds of thousands of

1242
00:58:50,980 --> 00:59:02,440
Ukrainians poles Slovaks

1243
00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:06,580
Russians Jews we we know what the SS

1244
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:08,320
division galina was doing and the

1245
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:10,930
veterans are marching on the streets of

1246
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:13,870
Kiev so that is really one of the basic

1247
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:16,149
fundamental differences the other

1248
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:19,420
difference is being course Russia would

1249
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:22,840
never been TV channels Russia would

1250
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:25,360
never ban websites I think that Russia

1251
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:27,120
will never ban I think that I think

1252
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,980
that's certainly subject to debate

1253
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:32,770
Russian but I could never ban books but

1254
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:35,470
I did want to give and we do have four

1255
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:36,820
million Ukrainians as guest workers in

1256
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:41,529
Russia so that that's the fundamental

1257
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:44,500
difference I know what's for China China

1258
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:50,110
is definitely one of the leading

1259
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:51,820
economic forces in in the world for us

1260
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:53,910
is both the challenge and the

1261
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:59,920
opportunity and I think it's more of a

1262
00:59:53,910 --> 01:00:02,500
China has more of an opportunity it is

1263
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,540
an opportunity because it is the fastest

1264
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,270
growing country in the world

1265
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:11,470
its economy purchasing power parity wise

1266
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:13,990
is already bigger than the US when you

1267
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:17,500
are talking about diversifying the

1268
01:00:13,990 --> 01:00:19,180
sources of getting energy mainly running

1269
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,180
away from Russia and energy sphere if

1270
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:25,540
China is very cooperative in that era

1271
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:27,100
Russia is in at area Russia is

1272
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,220
definitely interested also in

1273
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:32,500
diversifying the routes of

1274
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,990
transportation and has already become

1275
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:43,090
the number one source of energy for

1276
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:46,270
China recently mr. Putin was in Beijing

1277
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:49,480
for for the big summit of more than 60

1278
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:53,410
liters which are working on the Silk

1279
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:57,490
Road project which would be worth

1280
01:00:53,410 --> 01:01:00,160
trillions of euros dollars whatever they

1281
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:04,330
are about building infrastructure in the

1282
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:08,109
whole Eurasia so in my mind China of

1283
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:11,049
course is growing power but it is the

1284
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:14,680
main trade partner for all countries

1285
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:16,900
present here and it is also the driving

1286
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:19,390
force of growth in the world last year

1287
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:23,290
it's a bit accounted for 37% of the

1288
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:27,009
global growth so it's inevitable big

1289
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:28,420
power now I know the gentleman also

1290
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:29,650
directed a question Andrea Thompson I

1291
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:31,960
want to give you a chance to respond to

1292
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:36,240
the question it is I believe the

1293
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:39,190
question was the do we support also the

1294
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:40,660
build of a correct yes so the brief

1295
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:43,360
answer is yes we would encourage

1296
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:45,129
continued reform we've seen what happens

1297
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,440
when you put forth that effort so yes we

1298
01:01:45,130 --> 01:01:49,630
absolutely support the continued reform

1299
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,290
and efforts of what other okay and the

1300
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,240
gentleman here

1301
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:54,130
thank you very much Patrick Tucker with

1302
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,990
with defense one miss Thompson thank you

1303
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:58,660
for bringing up the may 10th meeting

1304
01:01:55,990 --> 01:02:00,399
between vice president pence and foreign

1305
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:02,319
minister klimkin here it occurred the

1306
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,510
same day as president Trump's meeting

1307
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:06,790
with Sergey Lavrov some of us in the

1308
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:08,260
press noticed some discontinuity in some

1309
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:10,270
of the media messaging about those

1310
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:11,590
series of meetings for instance the

1311
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:14,200
press readout of the meeting with

1312
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:16,270
between Pinson klimkin says that the

1313
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,319
vice president emphasized unwavering US

1314
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:19,270
support for Ukraine's sovereignty

1315
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,670
territorial integrity

1316
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:22,840
there is no presidential readout of the

1317
01:02:21,670 --> 01:02:25,900
meeting with klimkin but there is a New

1318
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:27,760
York Times report that says Mr Trumper

1319
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,560
played down his personal concern about

1320
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,350
the fighting in Ukraine - Sergey Lavrov

1321
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:34,180
in that meeting that day and that

1322
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:36,069
according to the official the president

1323
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:37,930
said American critics cared about the

1324
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:40,890
issue and asked the Russians to help

1325
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:43,330
resolve the dispute so is there a

1326
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,920
discontinuity between the vice

1327
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:46,840
president's office and the president's

1328
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,640
office on the need for strong sanctions

1329
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:52,480
and territorial integrity in Ukraine and

1330
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:56,560
more to the point how do you know well

1331
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:59,050
the there is no gap between the

1332
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:00,910
president and the vice president again I

1333
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:03,070
go back to my initial message on when

1334
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:06,069
the vice president spoke in Munich

1335
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:10,320
shortly after the inauguration on our

1336
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:13,990
support to Ukraine to the sport to Minsk

1337
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:18,340
that said we've add dialogue with Russia

1338
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:20,430
that it made many levels talk primarily

1339
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:23,760
with trying to find a resolution

1340
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:27,319
in Syria so there are areas where we do

1341
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,850
need dialogue and again the immediate

1342
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:32,930
discussion was had to be with wisteria

1343
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:36,210
how do I know I was I was in the room

1344
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:37,500
with the Foreign Minister the president

1345
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:39,060
and the vice-president

1346
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:43,110
I was not in the room with the president

1347
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:45,420
and his Russian counterparts but I know

1348
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:48,090
I end with them every day and I know

1349
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,410
that they are start the mornings and end

1350
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:51,360
their days together both the president

1351
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:54,930
the vice president they were speaking

1352
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:57,570
with one voice and so yes I've been very

1353
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:59,730
consistent on that consistent again the

1354
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:01,620
the president was consistent during his

1355
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:05,670
recent trip in Europe about the

1356
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:08,009
importance of our relationships at NATO

1357
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:10,830
with the EU and it's engagements there

1358
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:13,440
and again on our messaging with with

1359
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:16,830
Russian Ukraine thank you gentlemen to

1360
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:18,930
the glasses here uh reliably Milo Jones

1361
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:23,520
all countries have strengths and

1362
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:26,009
weaknesses what weakness of the Russian

1363
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:31,200
Federation to you as its neighbors find

1364
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:37,560
most worrisome for your future admirably

1365
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:41,689
succinct and you me who was the question

1366
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:43,910
directed to full definitely look to me

1367
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:50,190
[Laughter]

1368
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:52,500
though I can I can dwell on that I list

1369
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:54,180
a weaknesses but probably they will not

1370
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,150
coincide when we begin with four moves

1371
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:58,230
red guards and move move

1372
01:04:56,150 --> 01:05:03,360
well that's a very interesting question

1373
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:08,730
I think that one very troubling issue

1374
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:14,010
that I would definitely put is that I'm

1375
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:18,150
a bit afraid that the way how if you

1376
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:19,740
follow Russian internal developments the

1377
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:23,310
way how the country is developing

1378
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:27,120
currently it's the country that is to

1379
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:30,290
some extent closing down we had we had

1380
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:32,960
situation when Russia tried to be open

1381
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:35,990
society now we see that

1382
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,630
with all due respect but there is such a

1383
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:41,029
very nice Authority called Roscoe nods

1384
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:43,400
or which is centering not only websites

1385
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:45,530
but also Twitter accounts and and social

1386
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:47,750
media and also they have been some cases

1387
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:50,870
about foreign media about foreign agents

1388
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:54,290
I have a feeling that to some extent if

1389
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:56,029
since 1953 with all the history of

1390
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:59,060
Soviet Union after the death of Stalin

1391
01:05:56,030 --> 01:06:02,480
Russia was kind of trying to become part

1392
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:06,380
of international system there were

1393
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:09,020
attempts to do it throughout around 2000

1394
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:12,410
and I think that the turning point to

1395
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:15,050
some extent was the 2008 and what

1396
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:17,060
happened between Russia and Georgia when

1397
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:18,220
international principles and norms were

1398
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:20,840
not anymore

1399
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:23,810
observed so from that point of view I'm

1400
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:26,660
afraid that the biggest weakness is that

1401
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:31,100
Russia is moving away from international

1402
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:33,319
norms values and and law and actually

1403
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,610
considering that of the norm so from

1404
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,950
that point of view that's the biggest

1405
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:39,110
threat and when occur when I'm talking

1406
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:41,000
about closing down I think that to some

1407
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:44,330
extent the whole economic development

1408
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,640
not actually since 2014 since imposing

1409
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:49,910
sanctions but before was not on

1410
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,799
structural reform oppression economy but

1411
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:54,470
just spending spending and spending and

1412
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:56,420
as the close neighbors by the way we are

1413
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:58,279
not very happy with which the way how

1414
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:01,370
things are developing it would be in our

1415
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:03,470
greatest interest to have Russia as a

1416
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:04,960
stable partner in the international

1417
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:08,419
relations and there's a good neighbor

1418
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,910
despite all the facts that are not very

1419
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:13,010
good at this time we still try to keep

1420
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:14,240
some kind of engagement and dialogue on

1421
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:16,520
some of issues that neighboring

1422
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,520
countries are having but I have this

1423
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:21,920
feeling that by ignoring and actually

1424
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,320
violating international norms and also

1425
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,510
to some extent closing down mentally and

1426
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:28,460
and also economically it's it's quite

1427
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:30,220
quite a challenge so how does it look

1428
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:35,090
from from Tbilisi mr. prime ministry

1429
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:39,740
well I think that the biggest weakness

1430
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:44,480
is some kind of a fear to make this

1431
01:07:39,740 --> 01:07:46,379
major shift to concentrate inward on the

1432
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:50,370
economic development and

1433
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:56,750
on solving internal problems and not to

1434
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:59,250
follow this constant trend of

1435
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:02,790
distracting people's attention somewhere

1436
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:07,080
else I think this is the biggest the

1437
01:08:02,790 --> 01:08:12,150
major transformation that Russia should

1438
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:15,029
undergo tomorrow or some sometime after

1439
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:20,040
this and I think there is a clear fear

1440
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:24,270
to make that shift and I think this is a

1441
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:28,130
complex the whole complex of issues not

1442
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:31,590
to make enemies out of your neighbors

1443
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:33,990
this is a DES Edgar said we all are

1444
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:37,590
naturally and logically interested to

1445
01:08:33,990 --> 01:08:40,139
have a stable Democratic neighbor there

1446
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:43,860
is no doubt about it but this

1447
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:46,800
partnership should be based on the

1448
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:49,859
corner line Corner ston baseline

1449
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:52,020
principle of respecting territorial

1450
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:54,689
integrity and sovereignty and sovereign

1451
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:58,890
decisions of nations who are your

1452
01:08:54,689 --> 01:08:59,479
neighbors and the view from 12 mr. er

1453
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:06,800
mr.

1454
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:10,859
actually I do see a couple of weaknesses

1455
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:16,590
in an Terrell Russian system but I would

1456
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:19,679
prefer to mention just three of them not

1457
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:23,610
not going deeper one is is definitely

1458
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:26,910
the nature of the Russian system Ridgid

1459
01:09:23,609 --> 01:09:29,849
illogical and at the end of the day any

1460
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:34,170
kind of important decision in the system

1461
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:37,200
is about judgment of one person is a

1462
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:39,270
Russian president so it's it's

1463
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:44,010
definitely about his judgment his

1464
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:48,530
personal judgment second it's of course

1465
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:51,630
the necessity for quite profound reforms

1466
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:53,670
whether they are going to be embraced

1467
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:57,270
before the presidential election so

1468
01:09:53,670 --> 01:10:00,040
after but you know

1469
01:09:57,270 --> 01:10:02,410
it's about economy but it's also about

1470
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:07,840
society just got to look on the Russian

1471
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:11,559
demographic and of course delivering

1472
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,960
over phones would need additional push

1473
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:16,690
of urbanization for the Russian society

1474
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:21,330
and it's always crazy dangerous as you

1475
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:25,049
know and the third point is is a sort of

1476
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:28,540
divergent reality in Russia because of

1477
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:30,760
because of propaganda you know some

1478
01:10:28,540 --> 01:10:34,180
people a couple of years ago told me

1479
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:36,370
look Baba it's about switching off the

1480
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:40,750
TV and maybe if the Russian mentality

1481
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:44,290
will get back to normal in a couple of

1482
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:47,470
days or weeks I believe now after all of

1483
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:49,870
this propaganda it's simply it's simply

1484
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:53,500
not going to get back so switching off

1485
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:56,380
the TV does not mean that this virtual

1486
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:58,780
reality would get back to sort of real

1487
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:01,060
reality so I would mention just free of

1488
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:04,259
them okay thank you very much and we

1489
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:06,760
believe the microphone is over here yes

1490
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:09,520
the Valastro key days in Europe Study

1491
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:12,010
Center a very contem citizen by the way

1492
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,370
of EU coming from Lithuania and Baltics

1493
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:17,260
is of course my quick question basically

1494
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:20,320
over past days we've been discussing

1495
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:22,060
multi-speed Europe or multi-speed au

1496
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,120
which you agree that now we have

1497
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:27,430
multi-speed EAP this question of course

1498
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,250
GDP colleagues and while answering I

1499
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:32,470
would appreciate if you could actually

1500
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:35,250
elaborate how useful you find ap

1501
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:37,270
initiative and especially while

1502
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:39,640
cooperating not only with EU

1503
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:43,060
counterparts but among themselves like

1504
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:45,280
do you call Tbilisi from Kiev do you

1505
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:48,160
know as how did you do this reform and

1506
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:51,040
you know to share experiences and quick

1507
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:53,320
kind of frightening remark to our

1508
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,360
Russian counterpart thank you for coming

1509
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,849
here sir

1510
01:11:55,360 --> 01:12:00,070
so yes we agree I think everyone would

1511
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:02,830
agree that NATO is expanding by

1512
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:06,250
incorporating new members right we of

1513
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:07,400
course are increasing our true troop

1514
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:09,770
numbers and

1515
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:13,040
military equipment by our external

1516
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:15,290
borders but we never cross our borders

1517
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,540
we stay within our borders not like

1518
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:20,269
Russia so in short what are you afraid

1519
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:21,890
of thank you okay thank you very much

1520
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:23,150
for that question as we're running short

1521
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:24,860
on time I want to ask not only our

1522
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:26,449
questioners to be brief but also our

1523
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,460
distinguished panelists be brief for

1524
01:12:26,449 --> 01:12:30,500
every after all these the soul of wit I

1525
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:32,210
went as I guess foreign minister in

1526
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,310
Cambridge I think you you might tackle

1527
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:36,770
the first question and mr. Nichkhun of

1528
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:40,130
the second when he quickly danced for

1529
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:42,530
about Eastern Partnership is very clear

1530
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:44,420
yes we have very flexible and the

1531
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:46,489
dividual Eastern Partnership Program and

1532
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:48,800
I believe that those countries that have

1533
01:12:46,489 --> 01:12:51,230
signed association agreements all three

1534
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,719
have also visa liberalisation are the

1535
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:56,019
countries that are having their own

1536
01:12:53,719 --> 01:12:59,090
clear vision what they want to achieve

1537
01:12:56,020 --> 01:13:02,060
what we could do as EU still we should

1538
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:03,980
expand and deepen sectoral cooperation

1539
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:06,320
in many fields and I believe also that

1540
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:09,159
the real summit deliverable in November

1541
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:12,730
would be if we decide that the more

1542
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:15,949
resources the more assistance is being

1543
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:17,989
given to countries like Georgia Ukraine

1544
01:13:15,949 --> 01:13:20,360
and and Moldova because they have

1545
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:22,940
already achieved a lot and they should

1546
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:25,040
get more assistance so to some extent I

1547
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:27,889
wouldn't call it multi-speed Eastern

1548
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:30,440
Partnership I would call it as we do it

1549
01:13:27,890 --> 01:13:33,530
in the European slang flexible

1550
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:35,599
individual tailored partnership mr.

1551
01:13:33,530 --> 01:13:40,639
Nikolov fury response the question so

1552
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:42,170
what are we afraid from us it all

1553
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:46,030
depends of course on the definition of

1554
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:48,890
us is us is the the West the United West

1555
01:13:46,030 --> 01:13:51,620
we have some history of crossing borders

1556
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:53,810
the most distinguished cases of course

1557
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:57,739
of united Europe crossing our borders

1558
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:59,409
were in a Poland and Hitler as for the

1559
01:13:57,739 --> 01:14:01,940
United States is cross the borders of

1560
01:13:59,409 --> 01:14:03,940
militarily of 50 countries during last

1561
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:07,820
century some of them not once

1562
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:08,389
as of NATO us and Coalition of the

1563
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:10,790
Willing

1564
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:14,780
I can name quite a few countries which

1565
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:19,010
borders a which were crossed Yugoslavia

1566
01:14:14,780 --> 01:14:20,460
for example or Afghanistan or Iraq or

1567
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:23,730
Syria or

1568
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:26,940
Libya there were certain instances of

1569
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:30,809
crossing borders not just what are we

1570
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:34,739
afraid yeah I think it's quite natural

1571
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:37,020
to be aware of as I mentioned 400 points

1572
01:14:34,739 --> 01:14:38,218
of military presence at your border some

1573
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:41,280
of them with nuclear weapons while

1574
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:43,710
Russia has not a single military base

1575
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:47,519
installation on in the Western

1576
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:51,030
Hemisphere so we have some historic

1577
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:54,660
reasons to believe that the West is not

1578
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:56,280
just a force on the side of the good we

1579
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:58,139
have quite a strong military

1580
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:01,320
infrastructure which is increasing on

1581
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:03,719
our borders we are regarded in all the

1582
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:07,799
strategic documents of the US government

1583
01:15:03,719 --> 01:15:12,510
and NATO as enemy number one so just put

1584
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:15,480
us put you in our shoes and would you

1585
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:20,370
perceive it as a problem or just as a

1586
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:22,799
blessing of course it is a problem and

1587
01:15:20,370 --> 01:15:27,420
of course what we are afraid of now that

1588
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:30,480
there is no dialogue because the formula

1589
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:34,050
we hear is defence deterrence of Coyle

1590
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:38,150
okay we've got we've got it but it also

1591
01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:41,420
dialogue as I understand English

1592
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:45,030
dialogue is about talking to each other

1593
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:49,219
but actually every American official who

1594
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:49,219
talks to a Russian official is fired

1595
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:58,440
well we now know how to fire officials

1596
01:15:55,900 --> 01:16:01,000
we do not like in Washington just

1597
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:03,519
Russian ambassador should pick up the

1598
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:06,060
phone make a call and say wrong the

1599
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:06,060
wrong number

1600
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:12,520
he'll be out you know III met every

1601
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:17,380
single American ambassador not once

1602
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:19,750
since the 1970s since I was in American

1603
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:22,570
Studies as a student of America I was

1604
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:26,910
there at the Embassy many times I had

1605
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:28,360
lunches dinners breakfast with everybody

1606
01:16:26,910 --> 01:16:31,599
you know

1607
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:34,389
sandy versio was here and we met many

1608
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,940
times in many instances now nobody in

1609
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:41,080
Russia ever suffered after speaking with

1610
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:43,120
the US ambassador you know what worries

1611
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:48,700
me actually is something which was

1612
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:50,620
described in one of the books written by

1613
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:52,750
Richard Hofstadter you can imagine a

1614
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:55,360
very agile moderator here in American

1615
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:57,490
pop my position as the moderator here in

1616
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,049
come in I think I want to first give

1617
01:16:57,490 --> 01:17:01,599
Andrea Thompson an opportunity to

1618
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:03,460
respond to that and as well as as well

1619
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,630
as foreign minister klimkin made an

1620
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,890
indication and we have questions I

1621
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:07,690
really do want to get to from the

1622
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:09,250
audience we have 15 minutes to go so I

1623
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:11,769
want to implore everybody please be

1624
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:13,450
brief yeah actually for the for the good

1625
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:14,830
of this group and actually the topic and

1626
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:17,170
to get back to some substantive

1627
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:18,519
discussion I'd actually defer to foreign

1628
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:20,230
minister klimkin and get kind of get the

1629
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:23,110
discussion back on track thank you I

1630
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:24,549
want to direct quickly about although

1631
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:27,370
you know it's just a buoyant about

1632
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:30,480
multi-speed the Eastern Partnership for

1633
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:33,250
me it's it's really misleading because

1634
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:36,219
multi-speed it's about having the same

1635
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:39,550
goal and getting to this goal probably

1636
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:43,030
having different tools and different way

1637
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:45,520
of of how to how to reach it

1638
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:47,519
Eastern Partnership is about something

1639
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,500
completely different it's about

1640
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:54,280
framework and it's about networking so

1641
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:57,010
it's not about multi-speed at all so we

1642
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:59,559
have different idea political goals we

1643
01:17:57,010 --> 01:18:02,230
have different vacations so it's not

1644
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,590
about simply a kind of multi speed multi

1645
01:18:02,230 --> 01:18:06,559
speed reality here so

1646
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:08,150
favor of networking okay I'm also going

1647
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,370
to abuse my position as the moderator to

1648
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:11,150
bring corrected injustice because I

1649
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:12,980
think we've been talking a lot about

1650
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:14,629
Moldova we have a representative of

1651
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:17,839
Moldova that I see in the in the

1652
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:19,610
audience Ilona Mars I'd like to you two

1653
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,560
to jump in here actually

1654
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,940
Eliana more exact Republic of Moldova

1655
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,650
and suppose that I'm the only

1656
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:26,809
representative here of the Republic of

1657
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:29,839
Moldova it's a pity that our High

1658
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:31,940
Representative are not here and the

1659
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,800
panel is quite challenging for me as the

1660
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:36,530
representative of civil society of

1661
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:39,380
course Moldova has used to be a success

1662
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:42,530
story of this partnership and now at the

1663
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:46,730
critical moment and the decision now is

1664
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:49,610
very important even in 2015 the election

1665
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:54,230
showed that the pro-european parties are

1666
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:57,830
supported by our citizens now we have

1667
01:18:54,230 --> 01:19:01,009
the lack of associate equation and half

1668
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:04,850
of the population is pro Russians and we

1669
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:10,640
have a pro-russian president and it's

1670
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:13,490
due to our lack of reforms due to the

1671
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:17,330
theft of the million but it's because of

1672
01:19:13,490 --> 01:19:20,780
the very presence of Russian media and

1673
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:23,030
the propaganda is everywhere and we have

1674
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:25,759
this Russian president and we have in

1675
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:28,880
the history of in our society against

1676
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:30,890
NATO and European Union of course it's

1677
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,590
more a common from my side but to the

1678
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:36,260
question to representative of Georgia

1679
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:39,970
and Ukraine as you are the

1680
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:42,350
representative of your countries how you

1681
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:45,140
communicate with your population how do

1682
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:47,360
you attract the population that's

1683
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:50,780
against this European and NATO

1684
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:54,160
membership or what kind of communication

1685
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:58,040
strategy do you have very good question

1686
01:19:54,160 --> 01:20:00,470
we will have a comprehensive program of

1687
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:04,100
strategic combination communication we

1688
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:06,200
have a special ministry for European and

1689
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:10,010
Europe notic integration he is here

1690
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:12,970
present in this room and we have

1691
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:15,620
conducted intense communication

1692
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:18,640
campaigns throughout their ages

1693
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:22,460
among different parts of our society

1694
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:25,960
minorities also church representatives

1695
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:28,280
so we are quite successful in countering

1696
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:31,850
anti-european and anti Western

1697
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:33,259
propaganda for mr. Ferrell look I

1698
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:36,860
actually don't believe in

1699
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:40,460
counter-propaganda I believe in our own

1700
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:44,540
narrative in our all-powerful narrative

1701
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:47,360
and what what is happening what has been

1702
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:50,080
happening in Ukraine with the occupation

1703
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,910
of Crimea and with occupation of Dumba's

1704
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:55,040
actually supports our narrative very

1705
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:55,730
much before before the Russian

1706
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,630
aggression

1707
01:20:55,730 --> 01:21:02,540
we had just 18 percent of Ukrainians

1708
01:20:59,630 --> 01:21:06,080
fully supporting NATO membership now

1709
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:08,269
with 65 it's it's a completely different

1710
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:11,330
reality and the sense of perception and

1711
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:14,120
this personal perception is is not it's

1712
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:20,840
not gonna fade in fade in a way simple

1713
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:23,510
but my you know my if you like advice in

1714
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:26,990
the sense of your communication strategy

1715
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:29,090
although our Russian panelists somehow

1716
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:30,620
criticized me for that simply shut off

1717
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:34,820
all the Russian channels with the whole

1718
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:39,200
scrap and propaganda very simple and

1719
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:42,790
very very simple and if you analyze what

1720
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:46,160
what what is going on with whole stories

1721
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:48,650
you know somehow about Ukraine about

1722
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:52,190
fascist about you know hunter in Ukraine

1723
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:56,120
and the same stories about about modern

1724
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:59,509
many times you will have sort of clear

1725
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:01,790
you will make a real difference and it

1726
01:21:59,510 --> 01:22:05,480
now I believe it's about Moldova and

1727
01:22:01,790 --> 01:22:08,120
national security really so it's it's my

1728
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:10,009
serious advice I think we probably have

1729
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:12,260
time to get to at least one quote one

1730
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:13,820
question here just leave brief questions

1731
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,590
brief answers please a really bumped

1732
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:18,019
against partner the lady in the front

1733
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:21,080
thank you in the coupe survivor cat

1734
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:23,840
Rasmussen global I have a very brief

1735
01:22:21,080 --> 01:22:26,140
question to mr. Nakano you talked about

1736
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,290
Georgia and Ukraine as being sovereign

1737
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:30,880
countries but in fact this as I

1738
01:22:29,290 --> 01:22:32,769
understand it what you described was a

1739
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,110
limited sovereignty you can join the EU

1740
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:38,230
but you shouldn't join the NATO we don't

1741
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:40,599
think the EU is good for you anyway what

1742
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:42,969
needs to change in in Russia and Ukraine

1743
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:44,590
or Georgia or in the EU for Russia to

1744
01:22:42,970 --> 01:22:48,700
see these countries as sovereign as

1745
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:51,490
Russia first of all I'd like to react to

1746
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:56,309
the answer is about how to stop Russian

1747
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:59,700
propaganda so the answers are to first

1748
01:22:56,310 --> 01:23:04,360
create your own propaganda machine or

1749
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:06,940
shut down Russian channels and my

1750
01:23:04,360 --> 01:23:11,049
question is who is living in the free

1751
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:14,200
world actually because we are not

1752
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:20,100
cutting any any channels of information

1753
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:23,040
we have we have CNN BBC Deutsche Welle

1754
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:27,940
in every package in every television

1755
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:32,530
well we do not shut internet sites we

1756
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:38,679
have we don't we don't except for those

1757
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:50,620
who are you know who are for suicidal

1758
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:53,260
behavior you know actually today my

1759
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:55,690
recommendation would be don't cut

1760
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,280
information from outside because it is

1761
01:23:55,690 --> 01:24:01,750
harmful for your country you will get

1762
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:04,599
less information so if you want to live

1763
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:07,480
in the free world please do yeah this is

1764
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:10,090
also the world of free information as

1765
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:13,030
for the I would answer the question

1766
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:15,820
about what should change for Russia to

1767
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:17,790
regard Ukraine and Georgia as sovereign

1768
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:21,460
countries we do regard Ukraine and

1769
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:25,570
Georgia sovereign countries it does not

1770
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:28,750
mean that Russia has no say on what it

1771
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:31,750
likes or what it not not like we say

1772
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:33,130
this is something which coincides with

1773
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:35,450
Russia national energy is something

1774
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:37,700
which does not go inside

1775
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:39,860
they're national interests but if it is

1776
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:41,780
the choice sovereign choice of the

1777
01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:43,910
people of Ukraine or in choice of the

1778
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:46,849
people of Georgia it's a sovereign

1779
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:51,590
choice as well as there is a sovereign

1780
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:53,390
choice of 96% of voters of the Crimea to

1781
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:55,040
become part of Russia which there is a

1782
01:24:53,390 --> 01:24:59,150
sovereign choice let's promote ourselves

1783
01:24:55,040 --> 01:25:00,950
other George there is sovereign choice

1784
01:24:59,150 --> 01:25:03,740
of occasions you know they also have

1785
01:25:00,950 --> 01:25:06,380
their right to sovereign choices so I

1786
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:08,389
think what need to change is multi-

1787
01:25:06,380 --> 01:25:11,300
Union let's let's let and for that

1788
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:13,100
reason to recognize the possibility for

1789
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:16,430
the people to make their sovereign

1790
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:19,370
choices mr. prime minister I think my

1791
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:20,510
answer to promote the values you believe

1792
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:22,730
throughout the country was

1793
01:25:20,510 --> 01:25:23,870
misinterpreted into propaganda contr

1794
01:25:22,730 --> 01:25:26,870
propaganda this is not

1795
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:29,390
counter-propaganda this is promoting the

1796
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:32,059
values they hope majority of country

1797
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:34,130
believes and promoting the results we

1798
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:36,710
have been achieving during all these

1799
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:38,810
years this was a very brief remark okay

1800
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:40,430
thank you very much and now we are truly

1801
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:42,380
bumping up against the end because we

1802
01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:44,180
must miss I mean we must finish on time

1803
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:46,160
because the next the next panel will

1804
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,690
feature not only the Prime Minister of

1805
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:49,160
our host country Slovakia but the Prime

1806
01:25:47,690 --> 01:25:51,019
Minister of the neighbouring country the

1807
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:52,820
Czech Republic so I'm going to I'm going

1808
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:54,710
to wrap it up right now ladies and

1809
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:56,660
gentlemen you surely know by now the

1810
01:25:54,710 --> 01:25:58,970
refreshments are available just outside
