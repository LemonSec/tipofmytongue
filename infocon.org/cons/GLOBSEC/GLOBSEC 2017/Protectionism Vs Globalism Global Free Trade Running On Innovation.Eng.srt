00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:16,980
[Applause]

2
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:19,050
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen when

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,880
I was researching this panel earlier I

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,939
came across a report from the the

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,560
Reuters Institute for journalism from

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:29,130
2012 five years ago called reporting

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,750
global trade is it a dying art I think

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,930
it's safe to say that trade journalism

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,019
is in pretty rude health today not for

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,210
particularly happy reasons as we meet

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,640
now the rest of the g7 is trying to

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,559
convince Donald Trump to sign up to

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,149
language in the communique battling

14
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,349
protectionism something that was matter

15
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:50,850
of course at previous such summits there

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,949
are protectionist forces on the rise

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,739
across Europe in other parts of the

18
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,108
world we have brexit the departure of a

19
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,059
of a pro trade nation from the most

20
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,980
comprehensive trading bloc the world has

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,640
ever known so it's an interesting time

22
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,009
to help explain why traders suddenly

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,189
become sexy please welcome our panel

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,350

left we have Carol lah-nu who is a chief

all of you welcome to anyone watching

42
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,899
online including on Facebook um Stefon

43
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:02,309
maybe I can start with you we have some

44
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,479
people suggesting now including the

45
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,729
director-general of the World Trade

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,300
Organization that we are in danger of

47
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,550
slipping into a new era of global

48
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,880
protectionism and even into trade wars

49
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,820
is that something that you think is a

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:18,470
ability now yes it's a possibility but

51
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:21,230
the first thing I would like to say if

52
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,470
we look the experience of my country is

53
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:28,010
that it's not new that you have

54
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:30,800
resistance about free trade in fact if I

55
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,350
compare the debate in Canada about free

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,130
trade with the United States in the 80s

57
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:39,859
and today about the possibility that

58
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,410
will negotiate against this free trade

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,110
agreement with the United States in the

60
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,950
80s it has been a very difficult debate

61
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:52,220
in my country all the left was arguing

62
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:55,160
that free trade with the United States

63
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,359
is the end of Canada it was an

64
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:02,540
existential debate it was a debate about

65
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,790
who we are will we keep our country

66
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,859
together we don't tell you Ontario

67
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,750
continue to feed the other provinces

68
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,730
when they will not have an interest to

69
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,440
do so because they will they will trade

70
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,579
with the United States that not the

71
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,890
cajon provinces now decades after it

72
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:21,110
seems that we'll have to maybe

73
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,489
renegotiate NAFTA science seems quite

74
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:28,730
clear now nobody almost nobody in Canada

75
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:32,690
sees that as a good news the support for

76
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:35,780
free trade is all over the place we may

77
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:38,030
disagree about different aspects of the

78
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,210
agreements were signing but it's a

79
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:45,590
strong consensus we went through a

80
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:48,560
debate on Sita the agreement with the

81
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:55,220
European Union yes you have some

82
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:59,840
resistance among agriculture and the

83
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:02,390
union's the left-wing party the NDP but

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,800
overall it went well and the two main

85
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,619
parties the Conservatives and the

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,350
Liberals work on it I would say

87
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:13,790
something though when the Liberals came

88
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:16,700
with Justin Trudeau the negotiations

89
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:19,488
were stalled because you had a lot of

90
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,340
resistance in Canada but especially in

91
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:24,560
Europe there was the sense that this

92
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,109
free trade agreement is a thwart order

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,580
12 oil Wars to negotiate one with the

94
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,889
United

95
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,930
States so Canada is just a fake the

96
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,580
danger is the United States there was

97
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,039
the sense that it will be race to the

98
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:40,870
bottom regarding the environment worker

99
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,878
rights food safety and so on that

100
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,259
governments will not be allowed anymore

101
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,120
to regulate and Parliament to legislate

102
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,759
so what Justin Trudeau said is that ok

103
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,509
let's talk about that well now can we

104
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,150
fix it so we strengthened a lot of

105
00:04:54,509 --> 00:05:01,629
chapters on Environment Protection

106
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:04,448
workers protection social safety net and

107
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:06,969
the dispute settlement mechanism is not

108
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:09,639
involving directly the the firm's the

109
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:11,979
companies anymore it will be government

110
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,639
to government decisions who will be the

111
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:17,919
the arbitrators of the any disagreement

112
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,669
we may have and this helped a lot I

113
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,770
would say to make a district

114
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:27,669
acceptable so in the resistance we see

115
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:30,008
today about free trade I think it's a

116
00:05:27,669 --> 00:05:32,830
very important to be inspired by what we

117
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:35,830
have negotiation negotiation the you and

118
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:40,180
Canada to have progressive trade not

119
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:41,710
only to put the tariffs down but also to

120
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,710
be sure that governments and

121
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,109
Parliament's will do their job regulate

122
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,378
and legislate for good we don't have to

123
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,080
choose between trade and progress we

124
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:57,099
need both that the main point I would

125
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:59,589
say in order to to address the concerns

126
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:01,150
we see around we should not ignore them

127
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:03,699
we should not say you don't understand

128
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,729
rate is good value will we'll do it we

129
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:11,050
need to have trade agreements that are

130
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:13,539
progressive 3 so Carol that that line

131
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,150
that we've just heard about Sita is one

132
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:19,180
that you often hear in Brussels this is

133
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,710
a model trade agreement it's it's a

134
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,110
model for the next generation of trade

135
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,849
agreements it's something that Europe at

136
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,409
least should subject-to' emulate in it

137
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:28,839
arrangements with other potential

138
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:30,729
trading partners and there's lots of

139
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,099
ambition now over talks with Japan over

140
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,560
talks with clubs like Mirko saw on the

141
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:38,020
other hand there are clearly strong

142
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,550
protectionist forces across Europe and

143
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:41,349
not just in the countries that they're

144
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,180
sort of the old usual suspects like

145
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,120
particularly in places like Germany and

146
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,950
Austria so how do we sort of juggle

147
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,480
these these polarities do you I mean do

148
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,510
you think that Europe particularly if

149
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,820
America is starting to withdraw from its

150
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:57,510
traditional support for global trade do

151
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,770
you think Europe can be the new champion

152
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,539
Europe is certainly trying to be the new

153
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,750
champion or has been the new champion

154
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:07,540
for kind of open trade for the last many

155
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,370
years something rather or two decades or

156
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,770
more because until very recently let's

157
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,270
say we were in favor of a global multi

158
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,680
trade agreement let's say but then I

159
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,109
think we're one of the last bloc's

160
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,730
really accepting that we had to move the

161
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,920
bilateral route rather than the

162
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,330
multilateral route but you have to see

163
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,460
there are a bit competing forces but

164
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,280
probably what is most remarkable what

165
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,930
has happened recently is of course the

166
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,849
elections and France and let's say this

167
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,040
joint press conference of macro and

168
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:36,040
Merkel and Germany about 10 days ago

169
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,230
where both were changing views on how do

170
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,090
they see this and basically towards I

171
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,520
would say a form of a Europe first

172
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,739
policy and insisting both of them we

173
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,419
need to have full reciprocity of course

174
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,220
there's a paucity was in the debate and

175
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,220
Europe already but somewhere in the

176
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,260
early 90s but has never been applied

177
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,120
really applied this foreseen and many

178
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,980
pieces of regulation at European level

179
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,900
but the reciprocity means let's say you

180
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,640
only have access to all market if you

181
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,859
have similar access to the other market

182
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,539
and then we think probably not only

183
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,220
about the United States we may think

184
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,900
about China China which has taken quite

185
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,090
the taking over quite a number of

186
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,890
companies and Europe recently but do we

187
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,080
have as Europeans the same access to the

188
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,729
other market so that came up in that

189
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,159
debate between the two so of course it's

190
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,870
too early to make an analysis about this

191
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,060
what this means for the for the longer

192
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,340
term I think I would say on the

193
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,950
immediate future we will see the EU

194
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,359
trying to further complete bilateral

195
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,729
trade agreements we had an important

196
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:34,180
Court statement this week regarding what

197
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:37,150
is the capacity for the EU to almost as

198
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,859
the EU to decide on trade agreements in

199
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,360
that case it was a Singapore but which

200
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,860
is also very important for the Canada

201
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,770
trade agreement for the Japanese

202
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,260
Japanese which were dealing with said

203
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:49,480
and recognizing that for the pure trade

204
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,370
related issues the EU has an exclusive

205
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,420
competence which is extremely important

206
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,220
because there are some national

207
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,000
parliaments who wanted to take this back

208
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,010
from Brussels into

209
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,530
say you don't have this role anymore no

210
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,720
it's purely an EU 3d competence that on

211
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,000
pure threat related issues the EU has

212
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,800
the only competence of course what is

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,930
the problem I think I've seen over the

214
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,089
last years is that the EU has not been

215
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,040
sufficiently open not been sufficiently

216
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,050
transparent in explaining what it was

217
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,319
doing and that came up essentially with

218
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:18,729
TTIP of which Sita was the victim in the

219
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,250
debates which we've seen between

220
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:25,180
September October until December until

221
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,580
an agreement came what we have neglected

222
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,670
to do and that is more border party

223
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,560
let's say of how this structure works is

224
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:34,540
that the EU has these exclusive

225
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,310
competences but it's not explaining or

226
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,469
not saying what it's doing and I think

227
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:41,979
for us say the best example is that the

228
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,200
TTIP agreement is salt on the basis of

229
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,780
one impact assessment can you imagine

230
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,460
such an important agreement like TTIP to

231
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,709
Commission it on one big impact

232
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,660
assessment on that to say look this is

233
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:54,220
why we are in favor of this but for such

234
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,990
a great trade agreement you say we

235
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:59,200
argued this on one on the ways of one

236
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,610
piece of say academic research you can't

237
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,820
do this we have by the way as a

238
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,560
think-tank ourselves don't or an

239
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,610
analysis of that analysis but of course

240
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,229
they have others have come out of the

241
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,940
meantime but these things cannot happen

242
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:13,270
let's say for a competent administration

243
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,950
they have to much much earlier open this

244
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,480
up for to debate which certainly in the

245
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,280
case of TTIP I think in the meantime

246
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,020
four years ago they hadn't done of

247
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,089
course the Canadians had hoped let's say

248
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,460
to fair quietly and that wouldn't come

249
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,530
up but then it exploded and now I think

250
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,030
the Commission I hope has probably

251
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,680
learned lesson as saying in the context

252
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,350
of brexit which is the other the third

253
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,880
big difficulty which we have that in

254
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,280
context of praxis they will be fully

255
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,500
transparent however in that context we

256
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,569
may also see a tendency towards more a

257
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,640
form of protectionism because as you

258
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,520
know the II was taking a very hard line

259
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,050
on brexit so if you're no longer than

260
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,760
the single market will have to conclude

261
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,040
another trade agreement with you so

262
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,900
basically what is then the reference is

263
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,610
another form of a cita agreement with

264
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,819
Britain yes I'm sure we're getting to

265
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:01,120
brexit in in more detail Barry we need

266
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:05,350
to talk about Donald he withdrew from

267
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,780
TPP as he promised to as as we heard

268
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,979
earlier he will be aiming to renegotiate

269
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,199
NAFTA

270
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:13,269
and they've even been rumors that his

271
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:16,839
administration is going to threaten not

272
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:18,129
to abide by certain WTO rulings um from

273
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,919
the outside this looks like a pretty

274
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:22,689
grave threat to the global trading order

275
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:27,970
is it is it a serious as it looks

276
00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:30,129
oh yes and no and I think it's actually

277
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,899
a great opportunity for us to sort of

278
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:33,910
Rican SEP shua lies what the trading

279
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:38,769
system is and what its purpose should be

280
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:42,189
in a way that allows us to sort of wield

281
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:44,399
trade more effectively to promote sort

282
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:46,629
of peace and prosperity among nations

283
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:51,009
just a little more background in sort of

284
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:53,519
my group I you know as you know Tom

285
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:56,169
mentioned I run a program at a

286
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,039
think-tank a large think-tank in DC

287
00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:01,629
called new America but what my program

288
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:05,009
really focuses on it's called the open

289
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:08,529
markets program we focus on the

290
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:11,109
revolution that took place about 3035

291
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:14,369
years ago in how we approach competition

292
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:16,649
policy so we look at the effects of

293
00:12:14,369 --> 00:12:19,869
concentration of economic power

294
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:22,889
monopolization and how it affects us

295
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:25,569
economically how it affects us

296
00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:30,999
politically how it affects the stability

297
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:33,608
of complex systems and and we do this

298
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:36,579
both domestically within the United

299
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:38,709
States and we do it also internationally

300
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:40,809
looking at a trade policy essentially as

301
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,368
an extension of anti-monopoly policy

302
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:47,919
which is traditionally how we approached

303
00:12:42,369 --> 00:12:49,749
it in America and so and you know I have

304
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,549
there were two books that I've done my

305
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:53,109
first book was really about looking at

306
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:54,759
sort of the effects of concentration on

307
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:56,889
the international system that came out

308
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,600
in 2005 was called end of the line and

309
00:12:56,889 --> 00:13:00,309
was looking at how concentration makes

310
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,730
systems unstable

311
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:05,499
it makes them subject to crashes the

312
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,639
second book was cornered and that looked

313
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:14,470
at how the effects of concentration less

314
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:16,149
politically and economically but you

315
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:18,910
know the short story of what happened is

316
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:21,730
that 35 years ago under the

317
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,270
administration the United States changed

318
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,240
how we think about competition policy

319
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,829
radically we went from basically being

320
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:32,920
America's where modern anti-monopoly

321
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,540
policy was born and this goes way beyond

322
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,060
the Sherman Act this goes back to the

323
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,680
origins of our country we wanted to

324
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,030
fight private concentration of power

325
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,640
because that's how you set people free

326
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:44,079
and we did that pretty well for 200

327
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,420
years with the exception of the period

328
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,250
around the Cluedo kratts the reagan

329
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,250
folks came in and they came in with this

330
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,620
neoliberal idea they came in with sort

331
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:57,730
of the chicago school approach to to

332
00:13:53,620 --> 00:14:00,790
economics and they use that to upset how

333
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:03,190
we Duke how we deal with concentrated

334
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,689
economic power they basically set set

335
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,840
people free corporations free to

336
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,720
concentrate power that has led to a

337
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,520
revolution the structure of economics in

338
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,540
the United Sates and just to be fair to

339
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,699
anyone who worked in the Reagan

340
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,040
administration this was not a only

341
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:21,310
Republican project the Clinton

342
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,550
administration followed directly in the

343
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:27,040
pathway of the Reagan administration and

344
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,410
what the Reagan administration had not

345
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,939
unleashed the the concentrations that

346
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,939
the Reagan administration unleashed the

347
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,990
Clinton administration's did so and

348
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,340
actually the what the Clinton

349
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,990
administration did this is one way to

350
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,030
sort of get to the point of like Rican

351
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,650
sexualizing what the trade the system is

352
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:45,550
one of the things that the traitor the

353
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:48,520
Clinton people did 1994 1995 when he got

354
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,189
to sort of signing on to the Uruguay

355
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:56,770
Round of GATT is they carried the

356
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:59,350
revolution in antitrust into the the the

357
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:02,410
the international trade system and the

358
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,470
fundamental thing that was affected 1994

359
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:08,500
1995 was the shifting of power to

360
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,850
regulate trade away from one corporation

361
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,010
called the nation-state which in our

362
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,260
most of our cases happen to be

363
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,740
democratic corporations to a non

364
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:20,890
democratic corporation called the

365
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:23,650
business corporation so what we saw in

366
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:28,420
1995 was a radical shift in governance

367
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:29,449
to people whose goals were there to

368
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,390
serve their own interests

369
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,670
and their goals were - one of the ways I

370
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,890
did that was by concentrating economic

371
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:42,110
power and often concentrating capacities

372
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:43,280
vital capacities so as we kind of and

373
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,780
one of the effects of when you

374
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,610
concentrate vital capacities is again

375
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,310
the fact you end up with systems that

376
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,350
are subject to catastrophic failures

377
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:55,640
this is true in finance it's true in the

378
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:58,550
industrial system so I think as we you

379
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,590
know the opportunity here now that Trump

380
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,839
is kind of like rumbling and you know

381
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:05,420
sort of about jobs and about the need to

382
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,160
reconsider is the trade system is

383
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,680
actually taking at his word and really

384
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,079
wreak inception eyes the trade system

385
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,939
and go back to its initial purposes

386
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:17,330
which was to use trade as a form of

387
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:19,640
anti-monopoly policy to a distribute

388
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:23,740
capacity to distribute opportunity to

389
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,740
break private power to set people free

390
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,710
thank you

391
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,700
PIPA I'm sure you have one or two

392
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,140
thoughts about what's happening in the

393
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,730
States but right now I want to ask you

394
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,699
about BRICS it's you're based in London

395
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,820
you sit on the board of the new

396
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,040
Department for international trade

397
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:41,930
brexit from the outside looks peculiar

398
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,130
the largest deepest most comprehensive

399
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,109
trading bloc the world has ever known

400
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,630
written a traditional champion of free

401
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,490
trade it chooses to leave and soon

402
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:51,350
assuming that the negotiations get this

403
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,210
far we're going to see the mother of all

404
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,040
the trade negotiations as they try to

405
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,900
imagine what their future trading

406
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,680
relationship is going to look like can

407
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,810
you explain what of this to us so first

408
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,270
I have to say that my views are my own

409
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,710
because of the role that I have and also

410
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,660
we're in a period of perta

411
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:10,819
as they call it in Britain strangely

412
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,980
which means the election is in process

413
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,770
so and if you're careful in my remarks

414
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,450
also it happened I began my career in

415
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,700
the Reagan administration working on

416
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,650
trade policy and in fact my PhD is on

417
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,260
exactly this topic that the purpose of

418
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,440
trade policy is to protect competition

419
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,330
not to protect competitors but I'd like

420
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,910
to step back before I answer the brexit

421
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,159
question and just say personally I am in

422
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,980
favor of the freest possible movement of

423
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,800
goods capital and human capital across

424
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,110
borders however this takes place in the

425
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,240
context of politics and trade policy is

426
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,510
always a step

427
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,130
of the political arena so my father was

428
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,750
the principal trade negotiator for the

429
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:51,790
United States under presidents Kennedy

430
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,310
Johnson Nixon and Ford he personally

431
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:56,889
crafted most of the agreements that we

432
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,740
now fall back on including the World

433
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,480
Trade Organization so fast and then I

434
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,800
personally began my career working on

435
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,370
the preparations for the uruguay round

436
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,010
and the plaza agreement one thing we

437
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:11,459
have to keep in mind trade policy in my

438
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,860
father's day was all about numbers

439
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,840
univer negotiating i want five percent

440
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,719
on the tariff you want four and a half

441
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,000
let's agree four and three-quarters we

442
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,850
did that until we basically hit zero on

443
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,130
pretty much everything the issue by the

444
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:32,050
time I joined the White House in the

445
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:34,450
early 1980s was definitions not numbers

446
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:36,520
so the thing that caused a Uruguay round

447
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,830
to fail was that no one could agree on

448
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,780
the definition particularly in a world

449
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:44,439
where services were much much more

450
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:47,350
important than goods now I believe we

451
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,110
still can't define services we still

452
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:53,139
don't have a clear idea of what should

453
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:56,830
the level of tax or tariff be when you

454
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:59,650
can take an entire turnkey power project

455
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:02,050
and put it on a thumb drive what is the

456
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,210
tax or the tariff that you should charge

457
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,970
on the movement of that intellectual

458
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:09,310
capital across the border this is still

459
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:12,520
an open question so that's a technical

460
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:15,159
point the next thing is I entirely agree

461
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:19,120
with our Canadian representative here to

462
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:21,070
say that trade policy and open free

463
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,780
markets should never be taken for

464
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:24,909
granted and what we have done is to

465
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,879
assume that everyone of course would

466
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:30,250
support this it is a constant fight that

467
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,110
you have to preach that this is the

468
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,420
right thing and help people understand

469
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:37,120
why they have a vested interest in it so

470
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,800
we lost that fight mainly for lack of

471
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,129
interests we just assumed it was

472
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,830
arrogance on our part so now today what

473
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,420
we have I when it comes to when I look

474
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,980
at the world economy what I see is all

475
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:51,340
over the world we have separatist

476
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,800
movements we have people staying because

477
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,449
of the debt problem the ends don't meet

478
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,649
we can't

479
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,530
pay for all the things that are

480
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,390
important to us therefore why are you in

481
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,590
charge and the moment they ask that

482
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,750
question they throw out the

483
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,699
establishment they bring in new figures

484
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,230
that's what we've seen with brexit

485
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,910
that's what we've seen with Trump it's

486
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,920
what we're witnessing in many many parts

487
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:15,280
of the world once we have the new

488
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,950
figures in then they also have to remake

489
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,450
the case for what the economy ought to

490
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,660
look like what the rule structure should

491
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:25,030
be my personal faith and belief is that

492
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,460
all the work my father did to create the

493
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,200
World Trade Organization was valuable

494
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,770
and we're now going to fall back on that

495
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,240
rule system so worst case scenario and

496
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,520
this is a personal opinion

497
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,320
worst case scenario Britain will revert

498
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,050
to World Trade Organization rules with

499
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,000
the European Union now currently WTO

500
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,490
rules govern all EU trade with the

501
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,410
United States they govern British trade

502
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,790
with the United States now no one is out

503
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,580
protesting that this is a terrible

504
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,500
terrible disaster yes will the tariff

505
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,990
rates be higher than they were before

506
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,840
for some trade with the European Union

507
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,250
yes does that need to be addressed

508
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,800
absolutely but I think what we're going

509
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,450
to do now is begin to go test the

510
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,389
original framework that we put in place

511
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,030
I do believe the president United States

512
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:13,690
is going to fiercely test it by saying

513
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm willing to let cases go before the

514
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,910
WTO let the United States be judged

515
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:22,180
whether it has violated the rules if it

516
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:24,490
has there are penalties to be had this

517
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,070
will further engage the public debate on

518
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,430
the subject is this a nice easy road to

519
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,860
go down

520
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:33,580
no it isn't but here we are on this road

521
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:37,689
none of us can change this course the

522
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:40,240
public has voted for a new direction so

523
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,910
my view is let's stop complaining about

524
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,730
the wonderful beautiful romantic paths

525
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:48,160
that we had let's roll up our sleeves

526
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:51,940
and start to deal with the future that

527
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,010
we can craft and I do believe I'll say

528
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,040
one last thing controversial isn't maybe

529
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,350
when I look at the British economy which

530
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,030
I perceive as an investor and as advisor

531
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:04,270
to investors around the world is one of

532
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:06,340
the most dynamic fast-growing economies

533
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:08,290
it is the place that most people in

534
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,760
emerging markets are looking to is a

535
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:13,470
safe

536
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,870
Aven it is highly competitive in many

537
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,700
many things including manufacturing and

538
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,620
I say that as a manufacturer I

539
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,370
manufacture robotics in the United

540
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,860
Kingdom bottom line is it may revert to

541
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,899
WTO type rules with regard to the EU I

542
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,669
mean when people say you'll lose access

543
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,500
to the single market look Afghanistan

544
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,210
has access to the single market the

545
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,120
question is what is the price the price

546
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,310
will change but it's very interesting to

547
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,689
me that the one country the new

548
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,310
controversial president United States

549
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,680
wants to do a free trade deal with is

550
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:47,010
the United Kingdom and the u.s. is the

551
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,500
one country that is growing strongly so

552
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:51,510
if this forces everyone else to

553
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,580
reconsider their free trade deals that

554
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:55,350
they crafted many years ago and perhaps

555
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,909
begin to modify them in a way that

556
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,909
accommodates this new political

557
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:02,640
environment maybe we end up with an okay

558
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,740
results so I can't be a pessimist in the

559
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,490
face of all the pessimistic reasons one

560
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,360
might be start preparing some question

561
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,520
because I want to turn to the audience

562
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,280
in a minute but I just have to press you

563
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,670
on that particular point because it's

564
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,950
unusual to hear from someone based in

565
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:23,190
London optimism about the prospect of a

566
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:25,080
shift to WTO only rules and I suppose

567
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,090
one reason for that is that although as

568
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,699
you say most countries in the world of

569
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,439
course trade with the European Union on

570
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,970
well they have they may have a degree of

571
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,990
access to the single market which simply

572
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:35,550
means that they trade with it but

573
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,530
they're not members of it and yet

574
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,030
Britain as a result of having been

575
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,580
inside the European Union for more than

576
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,750
40 years has it has extensive trading

577
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,550
relationship that have been constructed

578
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,250
on the assumption that it is a member of

579
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:49,110
the single market so there's a going to

580
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,570
be a major at the very least is going to

581
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,540
be a major transition cost from leaving

582
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:56,820
the single market to having some sort of

583
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,020
WTO only arrangement if you can't come

584
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,419
up with a comprehensive such a

585
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,370
free-trade arrangement is there not so

586
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,560
here's the bottom line

587
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,350
businesses are gonna have to think where

588
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,169
am i selling who am i selling to and

589
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,840
what is the tariff involved in that sale

590
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,640
so businesses that might previously have

591
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,649
said I'm very comfortable I've been

592
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,390
selling to Germany or France for many

593
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,490
years I know exactly what the deal is

594
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,170
now suddenly that deal isn't there we're

595
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,790
gonna have to think maybe I should be so

596
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:25,530
to the United States maybe I should be

597
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:27,720
selling to some by the program maybe I

598
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,730
should continue to sell to the European

599
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,040
Union yes there'll be a higher tariff

600
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:35,360
but my question is a person who runs a

601
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,610
business is if your business depends on

602
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,100
the price of the tariff if that is a

603
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,899
loan going to kill your margin what kind

604
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,929
of business is that now if you are in

605
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,020
oranges or things that are biodegradable

606
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:52,230
right you sell fruits and nuts these

607
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,750
things live on incredibly thin margins

608
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:57,570
and you can kill a business with a

609
00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:00,480
tariff so I personally think government

610
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:04,350
should pay close attention to sectors

611
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,540
where that margin is so thin but in a

612
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,610
lot of other sectors that's that's not

613
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,340
the case and what it is is an impetus to

614
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:13,649
go tighten up your balance sheet tighten

615
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,810
up your margins get focused on what

616
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,180
really sells and what really doesn't

617
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:21,030
sell and by the way the world is your

618
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,430
oyster there you may have this massive

619
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,930
market yes but there's still whole rest

620
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,370
the world out there the last thing I'll

621
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,080
say is one thing I do find a little bit

622
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,000
comforting is when you canvass

623
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,439
particularly small and medium-sized

624
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,840
businesses and you ask them what

625
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:39,150
percentage of your P&L is international

626
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,790
usually it's pretty small small

627
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:44,490
businesses need to do much more global

628
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:47,040
business with the whole world wherever

629
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,780
they see the greatest advantage so

630
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,909
personally I think we have a massive

631
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,870
increase in global trade that can happen

632
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:56,310
if we get businesses to focus more on

633
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,739
global markets instead of just the easy

634
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,090
market at home okay thank you I want to

635
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,520
take one or two comments from the

636
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:05,120
audience now if I can please sir put a

637
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,120
microphone over here

638
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,130
Alan Riley Institute a craft only I

639
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,570
supposed to nervously want her ended up

640
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,070
having to talk about the brexit stuff

641
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:17,730
which really what doesn't really want to

642
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:20,639
but and the difficulty with this is that

643
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:22,680
I would like to have your optimism and

644
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,900
in fact I could be optimistic I wrote a

645
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:26,490
paper about how to do Harper exit as if

646
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,050
you're serious could you put the mic a

647
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,970
bit closer to go yeah if you're serious

648
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,320
you would do it over ten years you

649
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,610
wouldn't even trigger our little 50

650
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,260
until the 22

651
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,449
and you'd restructure the British

652
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,549
economy because essentially we are the

653
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,409
entire economy is built around a single

654
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:42,929
market and let me give you one example

655
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:44,309
of how difficult it is this is from vice

656
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:46,320
president of Ford Europe a couple of

657
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:49,379
weeks ago in Thailand and what he said

658
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,809
was this Dagenham makes all of more or

659
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:55,169
less all of Ford's car engines in Europe

660
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:57,899
they face a 10% tariff on the car

661
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:59,760
engines if they're outside that's not

662
00:26:57,899 --> 00:27:02,518
like that's the beginning of the problem

663
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,039
those cars we should produce in Slovakia

664
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:07,289
or Germany or wherever else they're able

665
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:11,220
to then be sold outside the EU under the

666
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:12,720
54 EU free-trade agreements on the basis

667
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,029
that the sufficient European content

668
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,120
because the British engines are such a

669
00:27:15,029 --> 00:27:21,809
large part of the content they will not

670
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,370
be able to rely on the UAE you FTA

671
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:26,100
tariff so you're not talking about an

672
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:30,239
FTA with just the EU you're talking

673
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,480
about 54 tariffs the 54 FTAs and that is

674
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,990
just one example in one sector and the

675
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,220
word that the Ford guy used and he was

676
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,779
doing it in a kind of way which I

677
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,130
suppose is not just to try and not to

678
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:43,649
say catastrophic he said it was

679
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:47,220
existential but the problem is is when

680
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:51,379
you go through sector by sector you take

681
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:54,960
a British you take a Ryanair and easyJet

682
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,389
who are facing having to expel their

683
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,070
share british shareholders because it

684
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:01,949
will not rain EU companies and they link

685
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:05,760
can't do point-to-point transfers within

686
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:08,370
the EU airspace or you take simply

687
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,039
mutual recognition which means that

688
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,229
telecom and data companies cannot

689
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,529
function within the EU they don't have

690
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,120
their their licenses so that you know

691
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,710
we're advising on this sort of thing so

692
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,570
we're the base if you were saying you

693
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,909
move to Ireland and that means the tax

694
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,529
revenue walks out of the country one of

695
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:27,419
my jokes about the British election is

696
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:29,250
that we have all of these political

697
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:30,960
parties basically offering spending

698
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,510
commitments and the real issue in the

699
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,750
election surely is this given the tax

700
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:39,389
breakers is leaving the country how how

701
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:41,429
do we cut public expenditure or increase

702
00:28:39,389 --> 00:28:42,639
taxes that should be the real issue the

703
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:44,830
British general election

704
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,750
I'm a real point about all of this the

705
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,820
real point about all of this is when you

706
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,070
assign it I mean it's so difficult be

707
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,929
optimistic about this because no one is

708
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,470
being realistic about where the United

709
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,880
Kingdom starts from and I think that is

710
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,470
the real danger here and I think the

711
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,180
inability of the political and

712
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,430
administrative clans to talk about it

713
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:06,760
seriously and about what our options are

714
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,920
is going to cause a well I would say

715
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,870
some political problems as we all go

716
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,540
forward whoever wins the election I

717
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,429
think it's that context I mean it's you

718
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:18,300
know I am by nature an optimistic person

719
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:20,710
but how on earth can use structure any

720
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,560
optimism when we have a complete lack of

721
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:26,620
reality about where we are starting from

722
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,320
okay thank you for that burst of

723
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:30,669
pessimism to count optimistic panel um

724
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,399
do we have any comments from the

725
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:37,210
audience ideally not on brexit at this

726
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:39,130
phase rate or any questions no not yet

727
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,600
no okay so who wants to follow a lot of

728
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:44,340
PIP I'm out of it to someone else first

729
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:49,570
very quickly I just want to say so uh

730
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:52,330
when India opened up its markets in 1991

731
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,280
it did so because they faced a complete

732
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:56,620
crisis and they had three days of

733
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,260
reserves i sat down with man Mohan Singh

734
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,060
at that time and he said I said what are

735
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,400
you going to do and he said we have no

736
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,230
choice we have to throw this economy

737
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:07,150
open to market forces because we have

738
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:09,250
three days of reserves left when New

739
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,320
Zealand did exactly the same thing and

740
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:12,940
through their economy open to market

741
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,389
forces it was because they had three

742
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,290
days of reserves that's a crisis that

743
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,270
forces the business community to

744
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:22,420
completely change how they do things

745
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:25,090
this is the soft version this is the

746
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:28,030
nice easy version where you have time

747
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,590
not your decade but you're not faced

748
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,470
with your back to the wall in that

749
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,750
situation I just want to be clear about

750
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:37,810
context nothing creates more radical

751
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:40,180
change than a crisis we're going to see

752
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:44,220
people do things and do them faster and

753
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:47,890
smarter because it's a crisis crisis

754
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,360
randall bar once said i was in a

755
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:50,800
conversation with him and i said oh my

756
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,169
god but we're going to have a crisis and

757
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,510
he smiled and said yes that is how we

758
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,760
get a solution

759
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:59,350
Filipa we could have avoided that crisis

760
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,690
because I think it's said but we didn't

761
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,290
avoid it did we that's a crisis Julie

762
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,370
waste it if you ask it's too late okay

763
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,590
Carol go ahead yeah but you should have

764
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,570
you should have used it as an argument

765
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:12,550
doing your referendum vote for us will

766
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,439
create a crisis no I agree but I I don't

767
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,480
think that was a great credit for point

768
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,730
either but here we are we cannot reverse

769
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,440
time but also the other thing I wanted

770
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,570
to say to you is they say what is the UK

771
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,760
it's mainly services it's a it's a good

772
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:27,129
importer and it's a services export

773
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,660
retail and about ten percent of its GDP

774
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,700
comes from the financial service sector

775
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,590
which is extremely international which

776
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,000
is not the SMEs no they are extremely

777
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,520
international and they benefit from

778
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,110
services trade with the rest of Europe

779
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,240
essentially on top of that services has

780
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,379
hardly been liberalized by the WTO I

781
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,420
mean they have been liberalized that

782
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,680
you'd be enough but not at the W to your

783
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,020
level a bit because there are huge

784
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:48,580
barriers at the W stool over which we

785
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,379
also have an agreement heceta I mean

786
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,720
there are many providers on services

787
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:57,100
trade even an acetal agreement within UN

788
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,630
and Canada so I'm blaming my prospect

789
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,879
for the UK and I would agree with you

790
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:04,510
let's say they they were just built on

791
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,760
the single market model yeah okay um we

792
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,820
we focus largely on Europe and Britain

793
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,610
so far what about Asia a lot of

794
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,080
Europeans a lot of officials in Brussels

795
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,000
like to point to the speech that

796
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,300
President Xi gave in Davos early this

797
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,190
year for look to him for a new champion

798
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,080
of a global trading order which might be

799
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,150
perhaps a little bit of a stretch but in

800
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,000
the meantime although America has

801
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:30,370
withdrawn from the TPP the I think it's

802
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,070
the 11 other countries are seeing if it

803
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,199
can be salvaged from from the ashes if

804
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,510
something can be salvaged negotiations

805
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,360
are ongoing with the RCEP between as Ian

806
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:42,129
and six other Asian countries so if

807
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,659
we're looking for places to be

808
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,040
optimistic if we don't think we're going

809
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,910
to find them in Britain if we don't

810
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,970
think we're going to find them in Europe

811
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,010
might we find them in Asia well I think

812
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,860
it's one of the reason why it was so

813
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:57,100
important to succeed with Sita I mean if

814
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,800
the EU is unable to act to negotiate an

815
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,959
agreement with Canada when they will be

816
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,720
able to negotiate anything in the same a

817
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,760
bit for Canada it's much easier because

818
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,030
Europe is a democratic world about the

819
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,150
same kind of it

820
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,950
we want as a government to see in what

821
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:16,250
kind of free trade agreements we may

822
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:18,380
negotiate with Asia China or the other

823
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:21,470
countries but it will be a huge

824
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:25,040
challenge because the it's not always

825
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:27,350
democracies while talking about and so

826
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,928
all the difficulties we had about rights

827
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,969
for workers protection of the rights of

828
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:34,490
government to regulate for the good will

829
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,130
be much more complicated but at the same

830
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:40,580
time imagine if you cannot protect NAFTA

831
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:44,450
as much as possible have Sita and I an

832
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:47,949
agreement with Asia what kind of great

833
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:51,320
situation will be from a geopolitical

834
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,429
perspective and on after what is at

835
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,320
stake here

836
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:56,030
for Canada I mean clearly I'm probably

837
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,918
the most trading most important trading

838
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,510
partnership the country has ever signed

839
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,950
and it's not at all clear what this

840
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:03,559
American administration wants to do with

841
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,780
it but it wants to renegotiate it what

842
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,910
is it what is your government see what

843
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:11,570
is at stake here wouldn't object we are

844
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:14,270
not the mother it's not us we want to

845
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,940
renegotiate it but if one party of Natha

846
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:19,540
wants to renegotiate we'll be ready we

847
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:22,310
will be ready we'll show in which way

848
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:25,520
NAFTA has been beneficial for everybody

849
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:28,009
while keeping the capacity of Canada to

850
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,899
stay Canada we have still our health

851
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,210
care system different than United States

852
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:34,638
that worker rights are different and so

853
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,609
on it's not true that trade created a

854
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,280
kind of uniformity where we have been

855
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:42,290
trapped as a country so we'll be well

856
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,070
equipped to show to our American friends

857
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,949
how much

858
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:48,500
both of us are beneficial to trade and

859
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:51,699
in which way this Agreement has

860
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:54,739
integrated our economies we cannot

861
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:57,259
imagine that that's a Mexico should be

862
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,970
pull out of it it would be a very

863
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,200
complicated thing to do

864
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:05,629
a last voyage a very simple example

865
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:09,109
lobsters from Maine lobster from

866
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,820
Atlantic Canada all of a sudden the

867
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:14,720
lobster of Canada will be much more

868
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:17,810
competitive on the EU market because you

869
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,450
know the gap is important and when you

870
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,890
when you have this tariffs gone

871
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,109
all of a sudden Canada must we'll be

872
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,270
much more competitive that's a key

873
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:28,369
advantage that you may do door to door

874
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:32,240
when you will be the governor of Maine

875
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:34,520
next time about three yes okay yep yeah

876
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,709
I mean I think on this issue of NAFTA

877
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:39,290
just sort of following up on that and

878
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:41,450
this is sort of the and speaking as an

879
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:44,810
American now someone who sort of watched

880
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,279
how the American public sort of and

881
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:52,820
studied how the American public

882
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:54,790
perceives trade last year or I guess it

883
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,410
is good way to started a few years back

884
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,859
Americans passed a piece of legislation

885
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:02,299
called the country of origin labeling

886
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:04,609
for a country of origin labeling this is

887
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:07,430
for meat and that we just meant that

888
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:09,619
when you went to the store when you want

889
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,540
to do a grocery store if there was a

890
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:13,579
piece of meat like you know in the in

891
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,170
the cooling of the in the cooler you

892
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:16,339
could see where that piece of meat came

893
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,320
from did it come from

894
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:19,880
the United States that come from Canada

895
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,609
they come from Mexico to come from

896
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,220
Brazil Argentina you know it's like in

897
00:36:22,609 --> 00:36:26,359
our clothes we have a law that says you

898
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,430
know it's like you look in the back of

899
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:31,490
your your t-shirt and well it came from

900
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:35,240
China or Bangladesh for Vietnam we want

901
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,770
the same thing for our meat the that got

902
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,479
passed this is something it was like

903
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,560
greater transparency it was something

904
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:45,980
that the people in United States wanted

905
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:48,440
the large companies that there's really

906
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:51,560
four companies that dominate about 80%

907
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,390
of beef sales you know beef business in

908
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,670
the United States they didn't like this

909
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:57,290
at all because these are all global

910
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:59,599
companies or international companies

911
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:01,009
they have operations in Brazil they have

912
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,940
operations in Canada they have

913
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:06,950
operations in in Mexico they actually

914
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:09,680
manage the flow of goods across borders

915
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,180
there's not open trade there's no market

916
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,890
between these companies I mean these

917
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,049
these countries they're trading

918
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:17,089
companies that move these animals and

919
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,720
these products across these borders and

920
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:24,710
this country of origin labeling

921
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,270
legislation this interfered with it

922
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,280
created a cost for them and interfere

923
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:32,270
with their ability to move this product

924
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,440
as they saw fit across these borders so

925
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:35,720
then these

926
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,210
went and they enlisted to government's

927
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,848
to take a case in the WTO what was

928
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,470
Canada the other was Mexico

929
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:44,599
now were these really representing

930
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:46,368
Canadian Cowboys were they representing

931
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:50,900
Mexican Cowboys no they're representing

932
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:53,329
them on their own selves and but I know

933
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,130
a bunch of cowboys I work with a bunch

934
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:57,260
of Cowboys I work with ranchers I work

935
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,030
with farmers and I can tell you one of

936
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,670
the things that made them very very

937
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:05,420
angry the last year was the fact that

938
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:08,750
their country of origin labeling the

939
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:11,089
this protection that had been that had

940
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:13,250
been allowed to them so that the people

941
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:15,349
who consumed their meat know where it

942
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,530
comes from had been taken away from them

943
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:20,329
and these are a lot of the people that

944
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,099
went out and voted I know what you saw

945
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:23,869
those counties all those rural counties

946
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,460
all those rural districts going red in

947
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:26,810
this last election I know those people

948
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,490
these a lot of these people were

949
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:30,170
Democrats they vote Democrat their whole

950
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,359
life and they voted for Trump in this

951
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:34,660
last election because they were angry at

952
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:38,569
that this action that have been taken by

953
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:40,490
Canada and Mexico at the behest of not

954
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:42,920
their citizens but of international

955
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,509
corporations okay I'm going to go back

956
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,000
to the audience now we had a question

957
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:48,290
here in the front you can and I see a

958
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,980
couple more if you could come to the

959
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:50,980
front here first

960
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:02,349
thanks pretty much and thanks for the

961
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,759
stimulating discussion so far I'm from

962
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:07,450
Australia I'm the Australian ambassador

963
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:09,309
in Vienna and we're no strangers to free

964
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,348
trade and economic liberalisation so

965
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:13,900
firstly I want to thank Europe because

966
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,589
Europe precipitated the crisis that

967
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:20,589
drove us to open our economy decades ago

968
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:22,150
by by undermining our trade with the UK

969
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:25,630
and through the Commonwealth so we did

970
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:28,329
that we've just gone through 26 years of

971
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,549
continuous economic growth despite all

972
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:34,299
of the global and regional crisis which

973
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:36,220
have occurred during those years we have

974
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:37,869
one of the most open economies in the

975
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:40,419
world we have a free trade agreement

976
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:42,789
with China one with Japan one with Korea

977
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,500
one with the United States and we have

978
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:46,150
free trade agreements with many other

979
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,950
countries and we were right at the front

980
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:51,009
of trying to get the TPP over the line

981
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:53,500
and we didn't quite get there but you're

982
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:55,119
right we are trying now to pick up the

983
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,539
pieces on that and do deals with others

984
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,069
coming to the question we do want to do

985
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:02,170
a free trade agreement with the European

986
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:04,058
Union and we've started the process of

987
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:06,910
doing that but I'm just going to be

988
00:40:04,059 --> 00:40:08,769
brutally honest here we are buckling up

989
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:12,308
for what we think will be quite a long

990
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:13,689
and difficult process and there are all

991
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:15,069
sorts of reasons for that but there is a

992
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,630
lot of protectionism in Europe

993
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:18,640
particularly in sectors which were

994
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,859
strong in like agriculture so my

995
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,288
question is although people talk the

996
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:25,869
talk in Europe a house how serious and

997
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:28,329
committed are you really to this and and

998
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:29,410
how committed are you to opening up to

999
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,819
the rest of the world not just

1000
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,160
specifically Australia with the rest of

1001
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:34,480
the world thank you and this might be a

1002
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,390
bit unorthodox but I want to ask you a

1003
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,819
question we often hear from some of the

1004
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,529
more gung-ho brexit ears that there's a

1005
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:43,509
very bright trading future for Britain

1006
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:45,279
which lies outside of Europe in some

1007
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:46,930
cases it lies inside the Commonwealth

1008
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,839
and Australia's a country that we often

1009
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:52,419
hear about how much excitement if any is

1010
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:53,950
there in Australia for striking a

1011
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,690
comprehensive trade deal with Britain

1012
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:58,149
once the terms of trade between Britain

1013
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:59,829
and the EU have become clear okay well

1014
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,799
is there's two parts to my answer the

1015
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:04,029
first thing I would say is that it took

1016
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:06,849
a bit of thought on the part of our

1017
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:08,839
government but before the brexit vote

1018
00:41:06,849 --> 00:41:11,420
was taken we did come out as a

1019
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:13,519
three and say that we did not think

1020
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:17,420
leaving the EU was a good thing for the

1021
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:19,008
UK to do so we did that in in concert

1022
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,200
with the then Prime Minister and the

1023
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:23,299
government government of Britain in

1024
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,729
terms of doing a deal a free-trade

1025
00:41:23,299 --> 00:41:28,249
agreement with the UK outside outside

1026
00:41:25,729 --> 00:41:30,769
the EU well of course I mean it's not

1027
00:41:28,249 --> 00:41:32,058
dumb we don't see it as a zero-sum game

1028
00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:35,419
we'd like to do a free trade agreement

1029
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:37,910
with the EU and with the UK our people

1030
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,859
sort of licking their chops about it

1031
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,808
I think it's going to drag out a long

1032
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:44,210
while for the situation to settle down

1033
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:46,880
enough for the UK to do it do deals with

1034
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,979
anybody and I suspect there may be some

1035
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,289
other countries which are ahead of us in

1036
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:53,509
the queue okay thank you very much there

1037
00:41:51,289 --> 00:41:55,819
are a couple of questions in the back if

1038
00:41:53,509 --> 00:42:05,599
you kids go to those and then I've got

1039
00:41:55,819 --> 00:42:08,719
yous well sir hi glad to be a member of

1040
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:12,079
this to participate in this forum and

1041
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:15,349
I'm super the president of China

1042
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,210
Institute of International Studies the

1043
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:19,339
think-tank attached to the Chinese

1044
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:22,249
foreign ministry five years ago I was

1045
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:24,078
the Chinese ambassador to Iceland so

1046
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:27,919
that counts

1047
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:31,549
well he first a a brief comment just now

1048
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:35,180
Philippa mentioned and tries to give her

1049
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:38,660
beautiful definition of the word crisis

1050
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,868
I don't add our Chinese contribution in

1051
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:45,078
Chinese we have a one word for crisis

1052
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:49,329
it's actually made up by two Chinese

1053
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:51,979
capital characters one is danger

1054
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:55,009
opportunity and you have danger you're

1055
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:57,618
pushed and and I teach Jim you said that

1056
00:42:55,009 --> 00:42:59,869
the Chinese for globalization and who

1057
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:00,920
compared group of globalization to their

1058
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:03,920
vast ocean

1059
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,930
he said that we will punch to the sea by

1060
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,290
the Western by the West

1061
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:11,359
didn't know how to swim and almost got

1062
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:12,050
choked by the way managed now that's the

1063
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,348
way to go

1064
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:19,819
well my questions regarding the just now

1065
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:23,059
you mentioned the master of ceremony you

1066
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:24,730
mentioned brexit and of course some

1067
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:29,270
people from the audience may also

1068
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:33,079
express optimism or customers and my

1069
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:35,869
question is well we used to think of

1070
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:39,940
London of course we hope which do you do

1071
00:43:35,869 --> 00:43:42,829
as financial center of the world and

1072
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,970
just take one example you the financial

1073
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:49,480
city you London

1074
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:53,899
it handles OTC maybe over-the-counter

1075
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:57,020
57% of all Chinese OTC is handled in

1076
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:59,290
that little spot alone now with that you

1077
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:02,509
can trick we take that as a springboard

1078
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:05,509
from London than to Europe if you are

1079
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:08,450
member of the EU but if you are out of

1080
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:11,450
it so my question for Philippa is you

1081
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:15,339
think that in the future London can

1082
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:18,740
still hope to be the financial center of

1083
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:22,520
Europe or only one of the financial

1084
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:24,049
centers in Europe thank you thank you

1085
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,160
very much you just pass a microphone

1086
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:31,040
along to the gentleman that yeah thank

1087
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,899
you thank you very much I'm Jonathan

1088
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,259
list former British influence think-tank

1089
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:38,420
and I space the question is about UK the

1090
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,829
UK having to conduct a lot of free trade

1091
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:42,950
agreements in a very short period of

1092
00:44:39,829 --> 00:44:44,420
time not only T to renegotiate the ones

1093
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:46,509
already has through the EU but then also

1094
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,339
the new ones and I suppose that that

1095
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:50,960
could mean that the UK is up against the

1096
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:52,520
wall and that other countries will be

1097
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,040
able to exploit it because it knows its

1098
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,960
vulnerability so how can you K work

1099
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,910
against that in order to secure it

1100
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,010
doesn't sort of get exploited or mean it

1101
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,839
will get bad deals and I suppose that

1102
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:05,240
iPad's ask the Ambassador as well how

1103
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,680
much Sita look different perhaps so if

1104
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,419
that's something that you comment on

1105
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,069
with it perhaps involve more services

1106
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:13,280
and it's a very general point you

1107
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:15,410
mentioned Asia Africa there's a I did a

1108
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,900
report just before the referendum on the

1109
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,379
common well

1110
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,029
and trade in relation to brexit and

1111
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:23,640
looked a lot of the economic partnership

1112
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:27,359
agreements and there is a lot of myths

1113
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:29,549
about the EU trade with Africa that are

1114
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:31,799
perpetuated by many people in the

1115
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:33,480
Commonwealth as well so it's kind of

1116
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:36,420
it's about public opinion for example

1117
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:40,380
the most enduring myth I think it's myth

1118
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,970
is that raw materials are not subject to

1119
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,349
tariffs but if you process them in

1120
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,359
Africa and then export them then they

1121
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:47,819
are now the EU insists that that's the

1122
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,319
myth but that ensures and which has

1123
00:45:47,819 --> 00:45:51,240
turned a lot of people against free

1124
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:53,220
trade in Africa and other developing

1125
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,598
countries so how do you work against

1126
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,819
that if you're promoting free trade

1127
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:58,440
against a kind of a tide of populism

1128
00:45:56,819 --> 00:46:00,359
which is maybe in favor of protectionism

1129
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,849
thank you thanks very much and then just

1130
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:04,380
one more here that microphones just

1131
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:08,250
there then we'll go back to the panel

1132
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:11,779
John Roberts with new things it's fine

1133
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:15,270
to talk about brexit in terms of the

1134
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:18,839
mainland of Britain but what are not now

1135
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:22,710
can I ask you given the way that

1136
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:24,900
politics intrudes it is almost

1137
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:28,170
inconceivable that you could have a

1138
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:29,910
return to a hard border in Ireland given

1139
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,529
the way in which the various peace

1140
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:36,149
agreements are came into action

1141
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:38,900
were based on in effect the removal of

1142
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:44,130
the border for all practical purposes

1143
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:47,760
does this mean that in order to have any

1144
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:52,710
kind of exit from the European Union

1145
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:58,500
that de-facto northern arm has to

1146
00:46:52,710 --> 00:47:00,990
somehow radically change its economic

1147
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,779
and commercial trading relations with

1148
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:06,868
the rest of the UK in order to ensure

1149
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:09,900
there is no hard order between North

1150
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:12,990
Marland and the Republic thank you very

1151
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:15,029
much we'll go back to the panel I mean a

1152
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,680
whole cluster of issues there a lot of

1153
00:47:15,029 --> 00:47:18,270
them brexit related not all of them but

1154
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,069
who people why don't you start there was

1155
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,329
a specific question directed to you sure

1156
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:24,180
and then we can go to whoever else wants

1157
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:26,369
to pick up the other themes so first of

1158
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,440
all the question of well the City of

1159
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:31,230
London survived as a financial center

1160
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,450
I think the answer is yes but what it

1161
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:36,030
depends upon is a simple thing

1162
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,770
I was the chief currency strategist for

1163
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:39,510
beggars trust the deputy had a global

1164
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:42,450
strategy for UBS I spent most of my

1165
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:44,940
career in the city money is like water

1166
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:46,680
and it will flow to wherever it faces

1167
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,540
the least resistance wherever you have

1168
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:50,819
the lowest tax rates the least

1169
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,579
regulatory red tape that's where it's

1170
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:55,349
going to go to your point sir about

1171
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,630
everyone will move to Ireland because of

1172
00:47:55,349 --> 00:48:00,660
the tax well we'll see what happens with

1173
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:03,450
the EU case against Apple because if in

1174
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:05,339
fact that goes the EU direction then the

1175
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,960
tax rate in Ireland will be the same as

1176
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:09,660
the rest of the EU and then nobody is

1177
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,880
going there so my question to the

1178
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,040
British is are they going to lift their

1179
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:18,270
taxes and the regulatory environment to

1180
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:19,680
be more onerous than the EU which I

1181
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,700
personally would challenge the British

1182
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,098
to do because I think would be an

1183
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,319
awfully heavy lift but if they manage to

1184
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:27,390
do that then they will lose Britain as a

1185
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:31,529
financial services centre if they remain

1186
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:33,779
in a competitive environment then I

1187
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:36,329
don't think that people will leave

1188
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:39,599
although there are new advantages to be

1189
00:48:36,329 --> 00:48:41,819
had from being inside the EU so some of

1190
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,160
the financial services activities will

1191
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:46,170
move I'm just saying not all of them

1192
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,270
will move and as someone who worked in

1193
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,910
that environment I welcome that

1194
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:52,680
competition why should London have some

1195
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,690
kind of monopoly over being a financial

1196
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,520
services center which should be

1197
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:58,260
competitive it should have to face

1198
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,839
competition from the rest of the world I

1199
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:03,210
just think that as trade people we

1200
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:06,569
overlook the fact that so much of that

1201
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:08,940
depends on the infrastructure of tax and

1202
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:10,710
the regulatory environment one other

1203
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,030
thing when we get a chance now is not

1204
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:14,220
the moment I think it's also very

1205
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,950
important people in the trade world they

1206
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:18,618
think only in terms of trade they're not

1207
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:21,540
thinking in terms of all the other

1208
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:23,700
aspects of the negotiation one thing

1209
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,160
Donald Trump is doing is everything is

1210
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,230
on the table strategic security issues

1211
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,868
trade issues and he will trade one for

1212
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:34,800
the other so it's a much bigger game

1213
00:49:30,869 --> 00:49:36,359
than just this narrow little silo that

1214
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,830
we tend to operate within

1215
00:49:36,359 --> 00:49:41,630
ok Stefan you I think I'm Aisha I hope

1216
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:44,210
we have done our best in the last days

1217
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:46,280
to dissociate the fact that the UK is

1218
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:48,620
leaving to you and the you convolve

1219
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:50,750
involvement in NATO this must be

1220
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:54,109
different completely different I hope

1221
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:58,160
will not mix up everything about Canada

1222
00:49:54,110 --> 00:50:03,040
and and breaks it the issue for us is

1223
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:07,460
twice first to fold first we had the

1224
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:11,240
abbot to use the UK as imported entree

1225
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:17,210
for Europe and it's by far or main

1226
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:20,299
trading partner so now it's if if Rex it

1227
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:22,490
becomes brexit it will not be the case

1228
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,620
anymore so it's a bit why the Prime sir

1229
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,029
appointed me the special envoy for

1230
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:29,029
Europe we need to develop a strategy

1231
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:31,760
that we did not do in the past and in

1232
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:34,130
this way I agree with Philippa that it

1233
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,950
will boost us in the obligation to think

1234
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:38,870
otherwise to adapt to a new world so we

1235
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,970
need to be strong in our ability to

1236
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:45,319
trade with Germany with the Netherlands

1237
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:48,290
and Italy and so on for for the EU

1238
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:51,080
countries it will be quite easy to go in

1239
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:53,650
Canada it's a Anglophone market close to

1240
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:57,950
the United States for us to understand

1241
00:50:53,650 --> 00:51:00,200
Europe which is still a very contrasted

1242
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,910
economy despite the seagull market it

1243
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,890
will be a challenge and we need them to

1244
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:06,109
to be good for that that's the first

1245
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:08,480
point the second point is to negotiate

1246
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,220
with the UK because we want to stay

1247
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,070
strong in our relationship with the UK

1248
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,709
but you cannot negotiate now because the

1249
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,540
UK is still in the EU and we don't know

1250
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,190
what kind of agreement it will be at the

1251
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,920
end of the day between the UK and the EU

1252
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:24,770
so we need to wait to see which part of

1253
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,510
Seeta may still apply to the UK and at

1254
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:28,910
that time you start to negotiate and

1255
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:31,760
awful it will not take seven years as it

1256
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:34,970
took with you do you have any advice for

1257
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:38,390
your Australian colleague who's about to

1258
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:40,520
embark on a serious discussion with the

1259
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,960
European Union having presented after

1260
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:45,080
seven years oh it's for me a question

1261
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:48,440
yeah well you have a colleague over here

1262
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:49,910
a Commonwealth colleague is concerned

1263
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,710
about some of the political forces in

1264
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,779
Europe as Australia embarks on trade

1265
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:54,880
discussions with the Europe

1266
00:51:52,780 --> 00:52:00,340
Union what's your advice to him be very

1267
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:02,980
patient we don't have the ratification

1268
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,840
yet but we'll have provisional

1269
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,000
application in the coming weeks and the

1270
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,830
tariff tariffs will be gone and at this

1271
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,870
very moment I'm confident that people

1272
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:14,170
will see that a lot of their concerns

1273
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:16,390
will not and then they'd be more more

1274
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:18,790
courageous and willing to negotiate with

1275
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:20,890
with Australia it was key to succeed

1276
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:22,420
with Canada and perhaps engage in a bit

1277
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:25,509
of outreach to the wall Union

1278
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,950
Parliament's as well yeah but that's

1279
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,630
where this Court's statement from this

1280
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:33,250
week was so important to say that only

1281
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:33,790
on the non trade part of it they can

1282
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:36,100
block it

1283
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:37,509
they cannot block it on the exclusive EU

1284
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,819
related competencies which is straight

1285
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,470
so on that of course in response to your

1286
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,510
question let's say the EU s protection

1287
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:45,100
is yes to some degree but they have no

1288
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,990
developing whole series of bilateral

1289
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:49,029
agreements but I would ask the question

1290
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:50,740
to you is the u.s. not protection

1291
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:52,750
starting us is more protections than

1292
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,310
Europe is if you think if you ask all

1293
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:55,600
European banks how they felt in the

1294
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:57,100
United States and how they still

1295
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,020
continue to fare in the u.s. how

1296
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:01,240
difficult it is to have access to the US

1297
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:03,460
market because u.s. applies its laws

1298
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:06,009
extraterritorially we have seen it in

1299
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:08,230
the LIBOR casas and in the urinal cases

1300
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:09,790
I mean there were cases fines imposed on

1301
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:12,280
European banks because they cleared

1302
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:14,230
under the US dollar and that's why I

1303
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,580
mean you were so applied but also think

1304
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,310
about the other big trading bloc in the

1305
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:20,470
world China how open is China for us I

1306
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:22,779
mean I know again bastard the Financial

1307
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:26,200
Services data the market share of

1308
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:28,960
foreign banks in China is 1% and that 1%

1309
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:31,270
includes HSBC for example which is the

1310
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,490
largest foreign bank in China but

1311
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:34,990
imagine 1% but it's not only that I mean

1312
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:37,089
there's so many sectors of industry in

1313
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:37,990
China but you cannot have access and if

1314
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,490
I look at these free trade agreements

1315
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,990
which have been concluded by many

1316
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:43,959
countries already with the China

1317
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:46,240
I think it's pure diplomacy of course

1318
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,460
probably but the exception of Australia

1319
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,709
but look Switzerland has a free trade

1320
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,940
agreement with the China who's the

1321
00:53:50,710 --> 00:53:53,590
biggest counterfeiter of the Swiss

1322
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,810
watches China

1323
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:57,010
why have they concluded a free trade

1324
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:58,360
agreement with China I don't know what

1325
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:01,260
is in there so I think it's only

1326
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:04,300
something symbolic

1327
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,170
diplomatic nothing more okay Barry okay

1328
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:09,260
yeah I

1329
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:11,330
1 or 2 this this conversation keeps

1330
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:13,400
coming back to the idea about that maybe

1331
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:15,140
that the challenge is to figure out how

1332
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,310
to trade more with each other and I

1333
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,859
actually want to put out through the

1334
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:21,910
idea that the challenge is actually to

1335
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:24,260
figure out how to manage the system of

1336
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:26,810
extreme interdependence that we have

1337
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:29,270
already built that we have built over

1338
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,920
the last certainly over the last 20

1339
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:34,190
years but really over the last 70 years

1340
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:36,170
and you know we're having all this

1341
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:38,270
conversation about Brexton how difficult

1342
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,880
it's going to be to sort of manage this

1343
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:44,360
breaking away you know is two years not

1344
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,540
enough do we need ten years we have a

1345
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,860
system however I just wanted you know

1346
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:52,220
yesterday last couple days there have

1347
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:56,390
been a couple of very close encounters

1348
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:58,790
in the South China Sea their US ship

1349
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:02,089
sailed very close to one of these these

1350
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:04,820
fake islands the the childhood we have

1351
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,950
fake news network Islands in the world

1352
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,090
so the Chinese have built a fake island

1353
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:10,009
they're using that to create a sort of

1354
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:11,600
claimed territory around this the United

1355
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:14,570
States says no with it's not an island

1356
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:16,670
and we conducted an exercise within the

1357
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:21,110
territorial the supposed to territorial

1358
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:22,790
limits of that of that island then the

1359
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:26,570
day after there was a very close

1360
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:34,640
encounter between Chinese and American

1361
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:38,390
planes in the South China Sea if there

1362
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:41,450
is any of these sort of near conflicts

1363
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:43,430
become an actual conflict if one of

1364
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:46,120
these near conflicts becomes an actual

1365
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:47,990
conflict that leads to a break and trade

1366
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,940
anywhere in the South China Sea it could

1367
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:52,370
be between Japan and China could be

1368
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:55,610
between Korea and Japan could be between

1369
00:55:52,370 --> 00:56:00,670
China and United States if there is any

1370
00:55:55,610 --> 00:56:03,890
major break and trade it all comes down

1371
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:07,670
everything comes down it comes down in a

1372
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:11,210
matter of hours it just comes crashing

1373
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:13,280
down now going back to the beginning of

1374
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:15,080
the interdependent system the

1375
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,450
interdependent system as many of you in

1376
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,328
Europe know goes back

1377
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:20,770
to the coal and steel agreements and

1378
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:22,210
what was the coal and steel agreements

1379
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:25,300
work well we're going to make it really

1380
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:28,030
hard for either the for the Germans or

1381
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:30,579
the French to rearm because we're going

1382
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,960
to take the the key of for armament

1383
00:56:30,579 --> 00:56:32,920
which is a steel industry in the coal

1384
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,130
industry we're going to put them under

1385
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:37,780
its common control and that way we it's

1386
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,220
creating a break now the rest of your

1387
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,420
economies you guys you work on that

1388
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,009
we're not going to like try and take

1389
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,540
this too far but you know we're going to

1390
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:46,060
create an interdependent system and

1391
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:48,099
steel and coal so that it's a it's a

1392
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,869
it's a you know passions can't go

1393
00:56:48,099 --> 00:56:53,260
quickly I spend it quickly out of

1394
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:55,260
control over the next 50 years 45 years

1395
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,579
we kind of gradually increased

1396
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:59,859
interdependence among our nations but

1397
00:56:57,579 --> 00:57:02,980
always with a lot of breaks in that

1398
00:56:59,859 --> 00:57:05,828
system what has happened over the last

1399
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:08,890
twenty to thirty years is radical

1400
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:11,260
concentration of vital capacities

1401
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:13,420
Keystone capacities in certain places

1402
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:16,210
certain kinds of semiconductors are made

1403
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:18,490
only in senshu and Taiwan others are

1404
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:22,329
made only in South Korea others are made

1405
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:23,729
only in Japan these now if you look at

1406
00:57:22,329 --> 00:57:27,069
this as a system what you see is

1407
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:30,900
multiple single points of failure there

1408
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:33,490
is no backup for these you cannot turn a

1409
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,079
faucet someplace and the semiconductors

1410
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:36,939
are not going to like comporting out of

1411
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:38,200
a factory in California they're not

1412
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:42,910
going to come pouring out of a factory

1413
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:44,799
in Germany there is no backup so here we

1414
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:46,420
are we have you know I mean Tom Friedman

1415
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,540
who some of you probably know his work

1416
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:52,210
the world is flat you know he came he in

1417
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:55,300
that book he said no to nations that

1418
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:59,230
share a vital supply chain will ever go

1419
00:57:55,300 --> 00:58:01,359
to war now I know the folks in who

1420
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:03,460
worked with Barack Obama these last

1421
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:05,980
eight years and Barack Obama believes

1422
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,630
that and Barack Obama pursued sort of

1423
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,190
trade policy based on that idea the

1424
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,119
United States has actually been engaged

1425
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:12,190
in this idea that extreme

1426
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:14,740
interdependence equals peace and

1427
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:16,510
prosperity but an extreme and it depends

1428
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,089
the type we have today what it means is

1429
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:21,849
that there is absolutely no room for any

1430
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:24,670
kind of error whatsoever because if

1431
00:58:21,849 --> 00:58:26,500
there is an error miscalculation by any

1432
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,830
nation could be the Japanese could be

1433
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,130
the South Koreans it could be the time

1434
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:34,279
these could be a terror actor an extra

1435
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:35,960
state actor any miscalculation or

1436
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,910
potentially a potential you know like

1437
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:40,520
potentially a conscious intentional

1438
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:43,399
action by someone who means to disrupt

1439
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:46,040
the system brings it all down so I would

1440
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:48,140
just say that the challenge for people

1441
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:52,009
who really care about trade in the West

1442
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:56,230
is managing the system that we have to

1443
00:58:52,010 --> 00:59:00,310
make the system more redundant more

1444
00:58:56,230 --> 00:59:03,380
resilient to break these monopolize

1445
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:05,630
concentrations of capacity thank you

1446
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,450
second question comment wholly agree on

1447
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:11,510
this I wrote a book about this last year

1448
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:13,069
xi Jinping and Obama signed a memorandum

1449
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:15,020
of understanding that prohibits the

1450
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:15,950
military pilots on both sides of the

1451
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:18,650
South China Sea

1452
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:21,169
from making obscene hand gestures at

1453
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:23,300
each other while flying now how close do

1454
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,710
you have to see the other guy definitely

1455
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,450
close to have to be to see the other

1456
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:30,200
guys I've seen hand gesture in a fighter

1457
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:31,759
jet forty feet max so this is how close

1458
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,830
we are and that's why I think it's very

1459
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,320
important to understand we may not like

1460
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:38,420
Trump but understanding his negotiating

1461
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,160
strategy is critical so when he said to

1462
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:42,070
the Chinese I'm going to hit you by

1463
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,470
labeling you a currency manipulator and

1464
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:47,750
then begins a dialogue about well let's

1465
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:50,120
talk about the South China Sea let's try

1466
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:52,580
and decelerate what's happening there

1467
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,319
and by the way we in the United States

1468
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:55,610
would like our infrastructure upgraded

1469
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,560
but we don't really want to pay for that

1470
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:59,180
and you're doing one belt one road how

1471
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,710
about you bring one belt one road to the

1472
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,210
United States and we won't label your

1473
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:04,280
currency manipulator we'll work with you

1474
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:06,200
on decelerating the South China Sea know

1475
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,940
maybe we're attributing too much

1476
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,359
diligence here to the new president but

1477
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:14,120
what I see is a negotiation by a real

1478
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,970
estate guy who says everything is on the

1479
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:19,069
table and that's why I said we have to

1480
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:20,629
be very careful not to be too siloed in

1481
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:22,850
our understanding of trade policy we're

1482
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:25,070
dealing with a president who has no

1483
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:28,430
respect for precedent who says

1484
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:30,200
everything is up for negotiation so I'm

1485
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:31,399
not saying it will succeed I'm just

1486
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,859
saying it's a different way of thinking

1487
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,750
about this okay fingers crossed okay

1488
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,270
I've got a couple more questions here

1489
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:39,250
right in the back here the women's yep

1490
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:42,020
please

1491
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:44,600
thank you I'm an alum Dave from Gateway

1492
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:46,340
house in Mumbai if I may come back to

1493
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,460
break suit and the Commonwealth for a

1494
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:51,470
moment the first country that Prime

1495
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:54,290
Minister may visited after she became

1496
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:57,290
Prime Minister was India I didn't go

1497
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:59,779
well with the government and both sides

1498
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:01,700
were I think upset with each other but

1499
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:04,520
of course it isn't only governments that

1500
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:07,850
trade and I can tell you living in

1501
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:10,370
Mumbai that Indian companies many of

1502
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:13,700
which are invested and set up offices in

1503
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:16,430
the UK are actually considering how to

1504
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:20,270
move out without too much loss and

1505
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:24,589
without disrupting what were existing

1506
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:28,370
and easy business practices so if maybe

1507
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:31,610
if there could be some more discussion

1508
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:33,650
of what's happening with companies not

1509
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:36,560
just from India but from other countries

1510
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:39,140
as well who have had their base in the

1511
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:41,210
UK for a long time a couple of banks I

1512
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:43,759
think have announced that they might be

1513
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:47,480
moving out okay thank you then that

1514
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:49,130
gentleman here think look okay

1515
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,820
the Ambassador wants to write a reply

1516
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:53,930
and then excellent okay and then and

1517
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:55,640
then one here and then I've got a

1518
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:57,980
question I want to add as well so we go

1519
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:00,319
to the ambassador thank you thanks yes

1520
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,570
so very briefly replying to your point

1521
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,340
we have a very good free trade agreement

1522
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:06,470
with China in fact it's pathfinding and

1523
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,930
hopefully if we can get it to work well

1524
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:11,060
we have can get a lot of agricultural

1525
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:13,430
trade and a lot of services trade and

1526
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:16,549
provision of services in China if we get

1527
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:18,560
it to work probably it should open the

1528
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:20,090
Chinese system to doing more agreements

1529
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,980
with larger economies and ours because

1530
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:23,660
we've got a small enough economy not to

1531
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:25,550
be threatening to China so they're

1532
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:28,160
trying and we have a gentleman here from

1533
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:29,570
China who who may comment on that we

1534
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:31,460
also have a good free trade agreement

1535
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:33,680
with the United States so sure there's

1536
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,850
protection in these economies but these

1537
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,649
governments are doing free trade

1538
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:38,029
agreements and and we're able to do our

1539
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:41,720
agreements with these countries much

1540
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:43,500
quicker than the sitting is or have a

1541
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:45,750
lot of I think you might take two

1542
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:47,670
you secondly on the South China Sea

1543
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:50,220
which is a major preoccupation for us

1544
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:52,320
yeah it is a very dangerous situation in

1545
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:54,359
fact being a glob sex quite fascinating

1546
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:56,670
because obviously Europe has its own

1547
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,290
internal security dynamics and some very

1548
01:02:56,670 --> 01:03:00,000
serious issues with Russia and so on and

1549
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:03,779
so forth but just to repeat something

1550
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I've said earlier here the long big game

1551
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:08,100
with China is the big global game and

1552
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,020
those sea lanes which go through the

1553
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:13,259
South China Sea carries some massive

1554
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:15,780
percentage of world trade so keeping

1555
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:18,030
that area safe and secure is a very very

1556
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:23,610
high global priority I think okay thank

1557
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:25,890
you very much institute the Central

1558
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:28,860
Europe I have two short comments and two

1559
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,569
short questions first of all this debate

1560
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:33,450
is about the globalization and

1561
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:37,560
protectionism 90% of it is about breaks

1562
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:39,600
it it's we have to start thinking also

1563
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,940
in a different dimensions and I'm very

1564
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:45,180
surprised that we got all wasted in this

1565
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:46,650
way down I've been running for 13 years

1566
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:49,200
the European automotive industry

1567
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:51,780
association and we have been fighting

1568
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:54,810
every single deal that has been

1569
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:56,970
negotiated by the EU with anybody have

1570
01:03:54,810 --> 01:04:00,090
it the Koreans with the Canadians with

1571
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:03,750
the Indians with the Japanese you name

1572
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:05,580
it the only deal that we have ever T no

1573
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:07,620
naked negotiations that we have ever

1574
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:10,830
supported together with the Americans or

1575
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:14,279
the TTIP I remember the first industry

1576
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:17,940
that in fact endorsed the negotiation on

1577
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:20,760
the TT now I have two two questions one

1578
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:23,510
to you Philip I know you can answer also

1579
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:26,190
both we have not spoken about TPP

1580
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:29,160
what is the future of the TPP what is

1581
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:31,650
the future of the of the region which

1582
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,690
Trump by throwing the TPP almost

1583
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:36,060
finished into the into the wastebasket

1584
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:38,460
has left to the Chinese the Chinese

1585
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,290
president immediately in Davos has

1586
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:43,500
mentioned we are free traders we are

1587
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:45,870
here you know so what so is it the 11

1588
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:48,140
plus 1/12 plus 1 what is it in the in

1589
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:50,790
the future and the second question is

1590
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:53,328
despite the fact that we didn't finish

1591
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:58,479
the TPP and the

1592
01:04:53,329 --> 01:05:00,920
the TTIP TTIP a lot of things have been

1593
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:04,009
negotiated and we have made a progress

1594
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:06,249
do you see way how we can pick up the

1595
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:09,229
bits and pieces that are laying around

1596
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:11,899
glue them together probably not in a

1597
01:05:09,229 --> 01:05:16,368
comprehensive deal but in something that

1598
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:18,469
resembles a limited detail thank you

1599
01:05:16,369 --> 01:05:19,999
thank you very much I know there's more

1600
01:05:18,469 --> 01:05:22,039
questions but I will come back to the

1601
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,689
audience I just want to add a question

1602
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:27,529
of my own on TTIP which on a slightly

1603
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:29,390
different aspect when well before it was

1604
01:05:27,529 --> 01:05:30,920
put into the deep freeze over the last

1605
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:32,269
couple of years an argument that eated

1606
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,099
that we sometimes heard was not really

1607
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:36,200
an economic one but a strategic one this

1608
01:05:34,099 --> 01:05:38,509
would cement the transatlantic alliance

1609
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,069
it would mean that Western liberal

1610
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:41,719
democracies were setting the rules were

1611
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:43,729
setting the terms of trade and that

1612
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:45,259
other large trading partners

1613
01:05:43,729 --> 01:05:47,660
particularly China and other Asian

1614
01:05:45,259 --> 01:05:49,369
countries would be forced to follow I'd

1615
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:51,200
be interested if any of the panelists

1616
01:05:49,369 --> 01:05:53,329
have a view on that and if it means

1617
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,669
therefore now that this deal at best is

1618
01:05:53,329 --> 01:05:57,319
in the deep freeze whether we are sort

1619
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:59,299
of ceding some of the leadership to some

1620
01:05:57,319 --> 01:06:03,469
of these countries so we've got that

1621
01:05:59,299 --> 01:06:05,299
question on TPP a question on Indian

1622
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:08,180
companies based in Britain so who wants

1623
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:12,769
to pick up some of these hipper I'm

1624
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:15,919
happy to jump in I have a view on this

1625
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:17,718
but it's very unusual one I think part

1626
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,660
of what has caused these trade deals to

1627
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:23,059
fail is that the technocrats of which I

1628
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:25,519
have been one of my career the

1629
01:06:23,059 --> 01:06:29,119
technocrats believe that it's all about

1630
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:32,180
the details but what they lost track of

1631
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:35,269
is if the leaders can't stand behind

1632
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:38,299
broad principles and aren't seen by the

1633
01:06:35,269 --> 01:06:40,339
public to be doing so then we can get

1634
01:06:38,299 --> 01:06:42,229
all the details right and lose the

1635
01:06:40,339 --> 01:06:45,049
leaders and lose the public along the

1636
01:06:42,229 --> 01:06:48,379
way and I think having canvassed a lot

1637
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:49,999
of the negotiators on TTIP that that may

1638
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:53,390
have been the main thing that happened

1639
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:56,689
that in fact we could fix this by going

1640
01:06:53,390 --> 01:07:00,680
back and elevating the discussion to the

1641
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:02,089
level of principles and then you can

1642
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,890
deal with the details now I appreciate

1643
01:07:02,089 --> 01:07:05,359
as a business person the details are the

1644
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:06,410
thing everybody cares about most because

1645
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:08,359
that's where

1646
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:11,569
the rubber hits the road with money but

1647
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:14,089
and I'm not in favor by the way I'm no

1648
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,900
big believer in these big g7 meetings

1649
01:07:14,089 --> 01:07:17,029
where everybody gets a lot of

1650
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:19,520
photographs but not a lot gets done but

1651
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:23,510
I am saying that there is a role there

1652
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:26,869
is a place for political leaders to be

1653
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:29,839
able to rally behind principles and we

1654
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:31,160
haven't seen that on trade in fact what

1655
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:34,069
we've seen our political leader is

1656
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:36,470
increasingly stepping back from that as

1657
01:07:34,069 --> 01:07:39,470
we go through this populist wave and

1658
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:42,529
until our leaders are believers and

1659
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:45,379
stand behind the principles it's hard to

1660
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:47,150
see how the details get negotiated okay

1661
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:49,220
thank you all right yeah yeah I'm just

1662
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:52,520
gonna actually I agree with everything

1663
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:57,859
PIPA just said and just having to

1664
01:07:52,520 --> 01:08:01,220
rephrase it a little bit and you know

1665
01:07:57,859 --> 01:08:03,980
the we this discussion of somewhat

1666
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:05,569
premise on the idea that the people the

1667
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:07,549
you know operate you know sort of

1668
01:08:05,569 --> 01:08:10,210
following populace following demagogues

1669
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:13,420
are disrupting this beautiful system I

1670
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:17,149
actually think that it was the elites

1671
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:21,710
that disrupted this system and they did

1672
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:25,389
it in 1994-95 with the particular

1673
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:27,620
version of ergh why that we passed in

1674
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:30,140
1994 that led to the WTO

1675
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:33,948
with the particular vision of the WTO

1676
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:36,109
that we have which essentially shifts

1677
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:37,939
control over the system from the

1678
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:42,580
people's government to private

1679
01:08:37,939 --> 01:08:45,439
government and ever since this has been

1680
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:47,568
approach to something that oh gee we

1681
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,719
don't want the little people to touch we

1682
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:52,880
don't want the Congress to touch we're

1683
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,830
going to turn this over to the experts

1684
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,929
I'll let the experts handle this because

1685
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:59,210
gosh you know it's like the people will

1686
01:08:56,929 --> 01:09:01,489
screw this up you know the people in

1687
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:05,960
most of our countries did trade pretty

1688
01:09:01,488 --> 01:09:08,358
well for a long time and we built in the

1689
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:12,259
50 years after the war we built an

1690
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:15,319
amazingly effective system for sharing

1691
01:09:12,259 --> 01:09:18,770
out both benefit and responsibility

1692
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:20,630
you know across the OECD nation so that

1693
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:22,609
was in that way there were flaws in that

1694
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:24,040
the flaws were that one flaw was that it

1695
01:09:22,609 --> 01:09:28,460
did not extend to the rest of the

1696
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:31,189
developing world but it worked amazingly

1697
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:33,349
well and that was the people's

1698
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:35,419
government's doing what PIPA was talking

1699
01:09:33,349 --> 01:09:37,279
about before which was negotiating

1700
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:39,920
directly with one another and making

1701
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:44,329
sure that pain and opportunity and

1702
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:47,449
benefit were all shared out well the

1703
01:09:44,328 --> 01:09:50,238
neoliberals the elites the plutocrats

1704
01:09:47,448 --> 01:09:52,790
they are the people responsible for the

1705
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:55,009
place we are in now and we should follow

1706
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:57,380
the people's lead and sort of breaking

1707
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:59,989
down the present system and moving

1708
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:02,030
towards a new and better system thank

1709
01:09:59,989 --> 01:10:04,759
you before I go back to the audience we

1710
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:07,099
had specific questions on both TPP and

1711
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,260
TTIP and does anyone what's pick up on

1712
01:10:07,099 --> 01:10:11,750
any of those capital take up on TTIP I

1713
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:13,460
mean I'm not I would follow flippers

1714
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,290
line let's say on reading a bit trying

1715
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:16,790
to understand let's say the Trump

1716
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:18,860
presidency and of course there's a lot

1717
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:20,210
of rhetoric and a lot of shouting but in

1718
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,739
the end what I hear already in Brussels

1719
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:23,599
and those which are following this like

1720
01:10:21,739 --> 01:10:26,030
you I mean we're either bits and pieces

1721
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:27,710
are already being discussed very low-key

1722
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:29,840
of course there's hardly anything in the

1723
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:31,460
media and it may be that initially we'll

1724
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,380
have some bilateral agreements like we

1725
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:35,510
have at Switzerland by the way specific

1726
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:37,310
agreements for specific sectors I heard

1727
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:38,989
a word negotiating pharmaceuticals or

1728
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:40,639
something in the car sector and they

1729
01:10:38,989 --> 01:10:42,110
will do this quietly that will not be in

1730
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:44,239
the media I'm probably who knows let's

1731
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:46,579
say that in three or four years time

1732
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:48,230
three years probably Trump will need

1733
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:49,969
some something for his reelection he

1734
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:51,259
would say look what I've done and the

1735
01:10:49,969 --> 01:10:52,730
meantime people have forgotten let's say

1736
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:54,800
that he was against in the first place

1737
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:56,570
so I think that may happen but of course

1738
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,550
like you say Simon I think personally I

1739
01:10:56,570 --> 01:11:00,619
think let's say the most important part

1740
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:02,719
of this agreement is that we have a way

1741
01:11:00,619 --> 01:11:04,400
to discuss with the Americans Europeans

1742
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:06,739
with the Americans on a continuous basis

1743
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:09,230
all our differences to avoid trade wars

1744
01:11:06,739 --> 01:11:10,610
like on cheese or on chicken or on

1745
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:12,049
whatever lecture like we've got in the

1746
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:15,559
past and that I think is the most

1747
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:16,940
important which we now have with Canada

1748
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:18,020
by the way let's say which is extremely

1749
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,119
important if you read the Canada

1750
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:22,280
Agreement you constitute many different

1751
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:24,259
committees to discuss about regulatory

1752
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,670
harmonization and the and technical

1753
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,040
problems and tariffs and many different

1754
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:30,560
areas so these Chinese

1755
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:32,480
Sasori Chinese Canadian and EU officials

1756
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,130
meet all the time and that's what we

1757
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,019
need the Americans as well that's by

1758
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:37,670
debate what we will miss with the Brits

1759
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,960
and that's what the Brits do not realize

1760
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:41,420
the moment they leave and if there is a

1761
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:44,570
heart breaks it than two years the Brits

1762
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:46,280
will be just absent everywhere and they

1763
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,870
are today and a thousands of committees

1764
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:50,660
and so many different things where we

1765
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:52,280
discuss all whatever very boring things

1766
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:54,500
for a broader public but they will be

1767
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,059
they will be out of that so what is the

1768
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,290
thing that they then have to respond to

1769
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,900
that question let's say I'm the person

1770
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:02,330
from from India they say the companies

1771
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:04,070
will no longer have the access which

1772
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:06,380
they have like for Canada by the way

1773
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:08,330
life for Japan like for India which they

1774
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:10,190
have to the EU market through London or

1775
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:12,620
through the UK today because they were

1776
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:14,599
part of that regulatory harmonization

1777
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:16,250
they won't have that single passport

1778
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,590
anymore or they won't have that single

1779
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:20,690
statue to deal - I mean to trade the

1780
01:12:18,590 --> 01:12:22,070
product from the UK or a service from

1781
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:24,440
the UK and the rest of Europe because

1782
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:26,450
the agreement is no longer than and that

1783
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,429
is the biggest problem and on top of

1784
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:30,650
that I think a big issue which is often

1785
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:31,610
underestimated is the free movement of

1786
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:33,740
people as well

1787
01:12:31,610 --> 01:12:35,420
so whatever the Japanese Indian

1788
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:37,849
Canadians who are working in the city

1789
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:39,380
well all over said no longer have this

1790
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:41,090
free access to the European market and

1791
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:42,830
vice versa which includes many

1792
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,510
high-level professionals or they will

1793
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:46,160
need to have special deals I mean it's

1794
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:48,440
all form of additional barriers which

1795
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:52,250
we're building to trade so that's what I

1796
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:54,919
wanted to say probably in a nutshell ok

1797
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:56,420
ok Stefan and then we've got about 15

1798
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,000
minutes less well I'll make one final

1799
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:01,340
round to the audience and a little round

1800
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:06,230
since the US don't want the free trade

1801
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:08,300
with the EU shrine for us who don't see

1802
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:14,629
you too bad for them but it's fine for

1803
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:16,340
us about about the Asia as I said it

1804
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:19,400
would be great for Canada where country

1805
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:21,920
at Atlantic configure the Americas and

1806
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:24,170
of the Pacific so it would be great to

1807
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:27,710
have a free trade agreement like the TPP

1808
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:29,390
but not any way not any agreement you

1809
01:13:27,710 --> 01:13:32,420
need to look at that very carefully

1810
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:35,750
so we're reviewing this huge agreement

1811
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:38,720
when President Trump decided to pull the

1812
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:39,600
plug so I'm not saying n a free trade

1813
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,700
agreement is a good

1814
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,170
thing I agree that we need to look at

1815
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:46,080
that very carefully and there are

1816
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:48,120
certainly things that we need to to

1817
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:51,450
review always and never take it for

1818
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:54,000
granted I mean for progressive trade not

1819
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:56,639
na trader 3 that is a race to the bottom

1820
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,690
for the protection of all workers of our

1821
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:03,030
farmers of our environment it's a big

1822
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:07,620
mistake but a word about the environment

1823
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:09,420
I'm very green myself I am known in my

1824
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:15,330
country for that I lost an election on

1825
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:18,380
the owner and a carbon tax so I think we

1826
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:20,580
are we have today a self-destroying

1827
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:22,800
development we have destroying your

1828
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:26,070
planet and putting at risk the next

1829
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,650
generations but I think as well that can

1830
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:32,370
can arise other countries humankind has

1831
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:34,830
a tremendous capacity to innovate and we

1832
01:14:32,370 --> 01:14:36,900
need to free this innovation we need to

1833
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:39,300
be sure that any innovation will be

1834
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:42,870
spread right away and for that we need

1835
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:44,310
trade thank you okay we've got just over

1836
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:45,960
ten minutes left I want to take as many

1837
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:48,180
people as as I can so please please

1838
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:52,290
please keep it brief I've got the women

1839
01:14:48,180 --> 01:14:54,120
just here and maybe keep your hand up so

1840
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:55,710
I can see you if you want to film Center

1841
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:58,260
for Russia Europe Asian Studies I want

1842
01:14:55,710 --> 01:15:00,210
to follow up on the Australian

1843
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:02,730
ambassador's comments people you

1844
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:04,950
mentioned how Ronald um

1845
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:06,509
Trump is you know this kind of tabula

1846
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:08,099
rasa he's unprecedented we don't know

1847
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:09,750
how he's going to negotiate but this is

1848
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:10,860
actually very dangerous we saw what

1849
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:13,170
happened with Xi Jinping at mar-a-lago

1850
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:14,339
he smoked him for a couple of hours and

1851
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,410
after he left the meeting he announced

1852
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:18,150
that Korea really was Chinese after all

1853
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:19,650
so having no background not

1854
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:22,110
understanding anything and having the

1855
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:23,370
newest leader whisper into his ear can

1856
01:15:22,110 --> 01:15:26,839
really be dangerous for US policy

1857
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:28,800
especially US allies and in regard to

1858
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:31,050
coming up with some sort of interesting

1859
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:34,530
trade deal with the islands we had a

1860
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:36,540
decision in July the we're talking about

1861
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:39,240
globalization so the the Constitution of

1862
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:41,910
trade really is movement on the oceans

1863
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:43,380
90% of trade is done by ships the United

1864
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:45,420
Nations Convention on the law of the sea

1865
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:47,400
there was a hearing it was decided that

1866
01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:48,780
with the nine-dash line China has no

1867
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,280
rights to that so these artificial

1868
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:51,179
islands it's clear so the fact that

1869
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:52,409
Trump might not

1870
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,420
down that and make some sort of deal

1871
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:56,009
about these islands is a bit odd but

1872
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:57,809
it's dangerous that he doesn't

1873
01:15:56,010 --> 01:16:00,030
understand so I think even though it's

1874
01:15:57,809 --> 01:16:01,139
an unprecedented approach it's very

1875
01:16:00,030 --> 01:16:02,459
dangerous for the international

1876
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:04,229
community because that has already been

1877
01:16:02,459 --> 01:16:06,119
decided that China does not have a claim

1878
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:08,760
to that area that's all things thank you

1879
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:09,688
very much sir did somebody get that

1880
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:12,719
please him

1881
01:16:09,689 --> 01:16:16,050
well somebody mentioned to the South

1882
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:19,189
China Sea I was going to remain silent

1883
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:21,479
again I had a second chance of that I

1884
01:16:19,189 --> 01:16:23,939
raised my hand thank you very much

1885
01:16:21,479 --> 01:16:27,059
actually I would like just to supply a

1886
01:16:23,939 --> 01:16:29,519
little historic fact because I'm also a

1887
01:16:27,059 --> 01:16:32,369
product of globalization had my

1888
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:35,659
education graduate schools in the United

1889
01:16:32,369 --> 01:16:38,489
States so use this opportunity and

1890
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:41,009
research through libraries national

1891
01:16:38,489 --> 01:16:43,438
archives and again a little historical

1892
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:47,519
record so we should be I maintain China

1893
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:49,889
should be thankful for her rights to

1894
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:52,650
some of the islands in the South China

1895
01:16:49,889 --> 01:16:55,800
Sea because United States

1896
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:58,348
Eenie after the second world war because

1897
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,360
the jerk Japan was the occupation of

1898
01:16:58,349 --> 01:17:02,519
Assam all over the islands your

1899
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:06,469
government then told us totally the

1900
01:17:02,519 --> 01:17:10,050
Nationalist government before I was born

1901
01:17:06,469 --> 01:17:13,050
go ahead and get these islands from the

1902
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:15,780
Japanese but the national system we do

1903
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:19,110
not have a ships then somebody in the

1904
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:22,530
government thought of your law called

1905
01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:26,789
land and the lease so we borrowed eight

1906
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:28,800
destroyers for the of them were used to

1907
01:17:26,789 --> 01:17:31,650
recapture these islands from the

1908
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,809
Japanese so named white Taiping Island

1909
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:36,420
is named the type you because the

1910
01:17:33,809 --> 01:17:38,880
destroyer we borrowed from you was named

1911
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:41,459
at - and so and so forth but anyway so

1912
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,139
now for the United States in China we

1913
01:17:41,459 --> 01:17:46,229
want to be friends want to be partners

1914
01:17:43,139 --> 01:17:50,579
not only for the mid-air collision

1915
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:53,909
agreement and there was a sea like

1916
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:55,920
agreement that is if there is two ships

1917
01:17:53,909 --> 01:17:58,860
coming from different directions each

1918
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,890
side is going to move to the right hand

1919
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:02,559
side and

1920
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:05,140
leave at least a while in between so a

1921
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,390
lot of offenders but very little

1922
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:09,160
raindrops

1923
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:11,680
so South charges like to keep it calm

1924
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:15,670
calm down and keep it the peaceful and

1925
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:17,800
so we a cooperation is the only correct

1926
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:20,290
way for our two countries

1927
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:24,100
fagor belies a just whatever very

1928
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:27,370
briefly very briefly for FTA when I was

1929
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:32,230
ambassador 5 years ago when I was bad

1930
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:35,530
leave and we were able to reach IFTA

1931
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:39,610
agreement with Iceland I hope you still

1932
01:18:35,530 --> 01:18:44,110
regard Iceland as one part of Europe so

1933
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:48,490
the question is if anybody from the

1934
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:51,070
European community Australia Canada the

1935
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:54,610
United States and about who is serious

1936
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:57,790
our region FTA let us stop because we

1937
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:59,589
are a big tank belonging to the Chinese

1938
01:18:57,790 --> 01:19:04,480
forum industry thank you thank you very

1939
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:07,660
much I'm Alan wait for the mic keep it

1940
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:10,809
brief if you could this is an on brexit

1941
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:13,450
question one of my concerns about the

1942
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:17,380
WTO system created in 94 which you were

1943
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:20,080
talking about earlier is the extent to

1944
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:22,780
which China has been a free-trade pirate

1945
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:25,809
on the system and one of the staggering

1946
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:29,019
I think observations about Chinese

1947
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:31,810
piracy is that up until the the date

1948
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:35,830
that China joins in 2001 the Chinese

1949
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:40,390
economy progressively opens once they

1950
01:19:35,830 --> 01:19:43,420
join and certainly from 2006 the market

1951
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:46,180
closes FDI finds it much more difficult

1952
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:49,570
to air to enter market opportunities

1953
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:51,400
close regular structures become tougher

1954
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:55,210
and isn't one of the real underlying

1955
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:58,570
questions about the the if you like the

1956
01:19:55,210 --> 01:20:00,640
value of the WTO in the sense of its

1957
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:05,019
lack of legitimacy which leads through

1958
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:07,870
the Trump election is in large part the

1959
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:10,300
trade piracy and the in winning us of

1960
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:10,960
the WTO institutions and the West to

1961
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,970
face

1962
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:14,790
China Frank

1963
01:20:11,970 --> 01:20:16,500
be on that issue thanks very much and

1964
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:17,550
did we have one question yes this would

1965
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,310
be the last one and then we'll go back

1966
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:23,850
to the panel John McCarthy I'm an

1967
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:26,610
Australian I work as an adviser to part

1968
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:29,280
of the Mitsubishi group I'm formally in

1969
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:31,759
the same game as as Brendan I think this

1970
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:34,830
question is probably for pepper

1971
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:38,400
you've talked very cogently about the

1972
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:41,910
way Trump does business and the way that

1973
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:44,610
he might bring all the elements to the

1974
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:47,790
table which is unusual in negotiations

1975
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:50,670
trade here security here and so on what

1976
01:20:47,790 --> 01:20:55,680
do you think that Xi Jinping's bottom

1977
01:20:50,670 --> 01:20:57,810
line would be in such a deal with Trump

1978
01:20:55,680 --> 01:21:00,240
that's an easy question on a hard answer

1979
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:01,920
but give it a try okay thanks very much

1980
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:04,019
what I'll do now we have less than 10

1981
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,400
minutes left so maybe I'll go to the

1982
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,780
panelists in turn and you can combine

1983
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,950
any answers you want to give to the

1984
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:10,170
questions we had with some closing

1985
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:12,000
statements so people why don't you start

1986
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:14,460
last questions directed to you and we'll

1987
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,980
come this way these two questions come

1988
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:18,690
together so and I hate being in the

1989
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:20,809
position of having to explain and defend

1990
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:24,839
Donald Trump but I'm going to have a go

1991
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:25,590
so he has appointed as the US ambassador

1992
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,360
to China

1993
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:30,240
Governor Branstad who is Governor

1994
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:32,730
Branstad Xi Jinping's best friend from

1995
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:34,769
the age of 17 when she Jinping went to

1996
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:36,690
the United States who is running the

1997
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:38,880
dialogue behind the scenes I do believe

1998
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:41,070
Ivanka is having close conversation with

1999
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,500
the Chinese ambassador in Washington how

2000
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:45,509
did the Chinese like to do business

2001
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:48,810
family family is a big thing for the

2002
01:21:45,510 --> 01:21:50,910
Chinese so when the president said North

2003
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:52,650
Korea's Chinese my personal

2004
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:54,510
interpretation is that it isn't that he

2005
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:56,250
got his history wrong it is that we are

2006
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:58,530
having a crisis in North Korea right now

2007
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:00,060
and the president's approach so far has

2008
01:21:58,530 --> 01:22:02,580
been to say when there's a big crisis

2009
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:04,440
somewhere to the Russians Syria if you

2010
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:07,050
want it you go deal with that you have

2011
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:09,030
it Ukraine if that's if you have issues

2012
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:11,490
there that's no American interest North

2013
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:13,380
Korea China you want it you go deal with

2014
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:15,150
it next thing we know the Chinese

2015
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:17,010
sending troops to the border to deal

2016
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:19,230
with the potential porousness and

2017
01:22:17,010 --> 01:22:21,360
refugee issue the Japanese announced

2018
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:23,339
their willingness to accept 52,000

2019
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:25,040
refugees should the circumstances arise

2020
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:27,530
so

2021
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:29,840
I think that whether we like it or not

2022
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:32,300
no one is going to stop this president

2023
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,640
from taking this unprecedented path

2024
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:36,890
although I say that I think frankly in

2025
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:39,860
history we have had moments where we've

2026
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:41,930
had strategic security and trade and a

2027
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:44,150
number of other things all on the table

2028
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:46,010
up for negotiation at the same time we

2029
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:49,250
just haven't operated as Barry you point

2030
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:52,220
out quite rightly the system has been

2031
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:54,440
very siloed and so many different ways

2032
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:56,120
so that's what we're used to but and I'm

2033
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:59,049
sure what if I were working in the White

2034
01:22:56,120 --> 01:23:01,280
House as I did once I would be

2035
01:22:59,050 --> 01:23:03,080
palpitating at the way the president is

2036
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,960
taking all sorts of things that you

2037
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:08,210
normally never put together and leading

2038
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:10,580
them into one negotiation but on the

2039
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:12,740
other hand that is the person the public

2040
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:14,690
has elected this is what we're going to

2041
01:23:12,740 --> 01:23:16,370
have so I don't see any way there those

2042
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:18,889
who believe he could be impeached out of

2043
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:21,019
this position we'll see but until he's

2044
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:23,720
gone but we have to deal with this okay

2045
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:26,990
Barry yeah just taking our what Alan

2046
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:30,800
said about the WTO in the West and I

2047
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:33,950
guess the charge that we failed to sort

2048
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:36,740
of respond to Chinese trade piracy I

2049
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:37,940
mean I would say the WTO was never built

2050
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:42,230
for that and that's actually part of the

2051
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:44,780
point the and in terms of the West I

2052
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:47,660
actually want to this flip that sort of

2053
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:49,130
perception of like who's at fault you

2054
01:23:47,660 --> 01:23:50,690
know I mean Donald Trump goes right he

2055
01:23:49,130 --> 01:23:52,160
blames the Chinese he blames the

2056
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:53,660
Mexicans he says the Mexicans are

2057
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:56,809
stealing our jobs the Chinese are

2058
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:58,540
stealing our jobs and no not true

2059
01:23:56,810 --> 01:24:01,690
Chinese are not stealing our jobs

2060
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:04,430
Mexicans are not stealing our jobs very

2061
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:07,330
large American corporations and banks

2062
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:10,100
and fee non Sears are taking our jobs

2063
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:13,070
taking our security and selling it

2064
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:15,350
they're shifting these things to China

2065
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:17,120
they're shifting these things to Mexico

2066
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:19,640
these are decisions that are being made

2067
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:22,010
by these very large corporations these

2068
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:25,460
very large feet of financial

2069
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:27,980
institutions outside largely outside the

2070
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:29,720
realm of political debate so you know

2071
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:31,429
it's like whatever we see is not

2072
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:32,960
something it's not because the Chinese

2073
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:35,030
are bad actors it's not because the

2074
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,510
Mexicans are bad actors it's because the

2075
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:39,259
fee not series and the

2076
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:42,900
and the these monopolist in our system

2077
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:48,960
we we have given them too much license

2078
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:51,150
to do with ours what they will now in

2079
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,610
terms of a fix actually you know just a

2080
01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:55,620
real quick let's end on like a positive

2081
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:57,480
note like what we can actually do and

2082
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:59,580
what I want to do is point a finger at

2083
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:01,410
something that Ronald Reagan did in the

2084
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:03,930
mid-1980s you know I mentioned before

2085
01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:07,019
how Ronald Reagan's were imported sort

2086
01:25:03,930 --> 01:25:10,500
of libertarian concepts into American

2087
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:14,180
antitrust law in the early 1980s he did

2088
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:18,360
not do that with trade law and in the

2089
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:20,910
mid-1980s after after an antitrust suit

2090
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,259
in the United States had resulted in IBM

2091
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:24,150
spreading out all of these different

2092
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:26,940
technologies that were inside the

2093
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:29,519
personal computer the Japanese made a

2094
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:31,349
play Japanese stayed in cahoots with the

2095
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,300
Japanese corporations made a play to

2096
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:36,150
capture control over all of these

2097
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:39,000
technologies semiconductors and very all

2098
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:42,410
these kind of other components Ronald

2099
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:45,030
Reagan at that time and his people they

2100
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:46,290
they had a couple of different ways they

2101
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:47,910
could respond they could let it continue

2102
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:50,850
to happen they didn't want to do that

2103
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:52,590
what they did is they said they could

2104
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:54,840
also try and bring it all back just put

2105
01:25:52,590 --> 01:25:57,030
up a big wall and they said no we don't

2106
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:58,710
actually want to do that either instead

2107
01:25:57,030 --> 01:26:01,740
what they did is they said they put on

2108
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:03,390
tariffs they put on quotas and then they

2109
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:05,250
went to the trading companies the

2110
01:26:03,390 --> 01:26:07,350
manufacturers they went to IBM they

2111
01:26:05,250 --> 01:26:11,130
wanted to Compaq they went to Hewlett

2112
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:13,440
Packard and they said the easiest thing

2113
01:26:11,130 --> 01:26:16,230
is if you just don't continue to buy

2114
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:18,990
only from the Japanese you should spread

2115
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:21,509
out your purchasing do not be dependent

2116
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:23,550
on one source go to Korea there's a

2117
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:26,970
little company called Samsung up in

2118
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:30,750
Korea okay from samsung go to Taiwan buy

2119
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:34,230
from TSMC and that one action led to it

2120
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:37,200
was a hard action by a government that

2121
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:39,030
led to the distribution of capacity the

2122
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:40,650
distribution of opportunity and the

2123
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:42,480
establishment of a system that was

2124
01:26:40,650 --> 01:26:44,429
marked by resilience

2125
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,980
okay thank you Barry Carol some

2126
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:48,870
concluding thoughts based on my own

2127
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:50,280
have a response for example to the

2128
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:51,720
Northern Irish question which I didn't

2129
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:53,219
respond to but that brings us back to

2130
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:54,930
brexit if you don't mind I mean just to

2131
01:26:53,220 --> 01:26:56,700
say that it's not Northern Ireland which

2132
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:57,810
have to reorient I think it's Ireland

2133
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:59,630
the Republic of Ireland which has

2134
01:26:57,810 --> 01:27:02,160
reorient because it's living from preyed

2135
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:04,800
predominantly today with the UK and

2136
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:06,809
every half mostly agricultural trade so

2137
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,850
if we have a tariff with the external

2138
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:10,680
border it will be twelve or fourteen

2139
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:12,270
percent so that's huge

2140
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:14,160
so Northern Ireland will have to

2141
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:16,590
reorient and how they will do it I don't

2142
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:18,840
know so the brexit question for the

2143
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:20,610
Irish economy is a really existential

2144
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:22,800
question apart from also the political

2145
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:25,559
problems which may emerge in Northern

2146
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:28,260
Ireland okay Stefan bring us to a close

2147
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:29,850
I don't know what brexit will do but we

2148
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,870
may all agree that it's much more

2149
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:36,420
difficult that what the proposal was at

2150
01:27:33,870 --> 01:27:38,309
the beginning and up to now it has not

2151
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:41,940
been so much it seems to me from the XL

2152
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:46,530
as an observer a debate between the EU

2153
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:49,110
and and retain it has been a debate

2154
01:27:46,530 --> 01:27:51,300
within the British society society

2155
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:54,320
itself it's not an easy one

2156
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:57,300
I think the countries that will succeed

2157
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:01,009
during the next three decades will be

2158
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:03,989
the ones that will be able to negotiate

2159
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:06,480
free trade agreements that will be what

2160
01:28:03,989 --> 01:28:08,969
about called progressive trade not only

2161
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:12,000
the tariffs going down but also

2162
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:14,570
protections for everything people care

2163
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:19,710
about the environment the health care

2164
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:23,099
food safety workers rights agriculture

2165
01:28:19,710 --> 01:28:26,370
that's true that it's negotiable and I

2166
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:28,650
would argue that an example of it if is

2167
01:28:26,370 --> 01:28:30,870
seated and every proud that we have been

2168
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:33,570
able to dig oh she ate it and now our

2169
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:35,280
task is to prove that it works in order

2170
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:37,469
to give courage to people that it's

2171
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:38,219
possible to have trade and progress all

2172
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:40,170
together

2173
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:41,460
thanks very much nan that load we'll

2174
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:42,390
have to bring it to a close I think it's

2175
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,070
been an absolutely fascinating

2176
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:45,989
discussion thanks very much to the

2177
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:49,160
audience for your great questions and

2178
01:28:45,989 --> 01:28:49,160
please join me in thanking the panel

2179
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:57,890
and we have 30 minutes refreshment break

2180
01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:59,630

2181
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:01,490
ground floor in the hotel and the next

2182
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:05,110
session will be on the future of war

2183
01:29:01,490 --> 01:29:05,110
starting here at 3:30

2184
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:34,740
[Music]

2185
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:34,740
