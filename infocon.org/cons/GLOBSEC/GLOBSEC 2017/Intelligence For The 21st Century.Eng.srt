2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,048
good morning everybody

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:14,129
the title of this panel is intelligence

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:19,350
in the 21st century which is as wide as

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:22,350
diffused we have 75 minutes I'll open

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,869
with a short introductory and presenting

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,119
our distinguished guests and then start

8
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,960
the discussion they gave me a new piece

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,769
so I'll get a strict warning when our

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:38,010
time is up and so we need to keep it as

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,590
short and concise and I think that we

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,839
have the right people to to do so before

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,969
in making the introduction I would like

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,820
to share you one memory this is not the

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,800
first time for me I just recalled facing

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,199
or participating in a panel called

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:55,919
intelligence in the 21st century when I

18
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,649
was a PhD student in Cambridge in early

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,579
of last decade there was a class called

20
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,979
history of intelligence and a specific

21
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:07,670
specific lesson called intelligence in

22
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,110
the 21st century and counterterrorism

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,890
and the professor came that day to

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,720
Cambridge and said professor which I'm

25
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,119
not going to name not to embarrass him

26
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,350
and said ladies and gentlemen I know

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,240
that I need to teach you about

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,710
intelligence and about the importance of

29
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,970
intelligence the future of intelligence

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,649
the importance of intelligence and

31
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,869
counterterrorism but to tell you the

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,450
truth I think it's not relevant

33
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,790
I think intelligence is not relevant it

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,680
never was relevant it didn't have the

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,140
real effect on history and you know

36
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,390
terrorism our days well maybe in the

37
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,049
past but this is there are more

38
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,479
important topics on the world agenda

39
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:47,100
just to add one fun fact the this

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,610
meeting took place on the 5th of

41
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,520
September 2001 that professor doesn't

42
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,130
teach anymore in Cambridge so I think

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,890
that there is no um there is no debate

44
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,320
today on the profound importance of

45
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,670
intelligence and I think we have the

46
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,728
right people to discuss this the first

47
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,979
one to my left Secretary Michael

48
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,110
Chertoff is a lawyer who served as a

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,890
federal prosecutor and as a the

50
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,170
assistant US

51
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,679
attorney general 2005 he was appointed

52
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,690
US Secretary of Homeland Security job in

53
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,800
which he had to deal with much of the

54
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,620
repercussions of 9/11 co-authored the

55
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,090
famous Patriot Act upon retiring he

56
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,030
became the executive chairman and

57
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,950
co-founder of the Chertoff group which

58
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,840
if I may add from a person a large

59
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,630
reside in one of the most beautiful

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,239
buildings in DC and with the best views

61
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:45,109
so if ever secretary Chertoff invites

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,370
you do not miss the opportunity to visit

63

66
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,880

counterterrorism encounter extremism I'm

102
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,869
going to ask you afterwards what's the

difference between counter terrorism and

104

counter extremism and isn't this just

105
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,369
you for me

106
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,719
political correctness mr. Sami was a

107
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,139

human resources and security at the

115
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,760
European Commission in Brussels so as I

116
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,299
said there is no dispute on the

117
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,240
importance of intelligence but after

118
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,400
saying that does do the intelligence

119
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,990
services of the Democratic world of the

120
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,060
west of Western Europe of the United

121
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,970
States supplied their citizen their

122
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,830
countrymen the people who they sent them

123
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:19,820
to protect them the shield

124
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,859
they deserve just mentioning few of the

125
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,400
recent failures of intelligence services

126
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,100
they didn't see the establishment of

127
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,159
Isis and they didn't and still

128
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,190
profoundly lack intelligence of what is

129
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,900
happening Iraq and muscle they didn't

130
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,639
know about the coming invasion of Russia

131
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:42,888
to cream to Ukraine and then to Syria

132
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,919
Europe sustains attack after attack of

133
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,960
terrorism most of these attacks are not

134
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,710
prevented and it prevented in most cases

135
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,060
just by mere coincidence and luck to

136
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,880
bears one called

137
00:05:53,060 --> 00:06:01,370
cozy bear the other one fancy bear apt

138
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:03,469
21 and apt 28 28 and 29 attacked the

139

140
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,810
Democratic Party in the United States

141
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,150
both allegedly belong to Russian

142
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,190
intelligence nothing was done to stop

143
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,659
them North Korea the West doesn't have a

144
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,570
clear idea what is happening in North

145
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:19,940
Korea and this real Empire of evil is

146
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:24,289
surprising the west again and again in

147
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:26,270
their moves and last an ongoing

148
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:29,650

the alleged inappropriate unappropriate

150
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,239
connection between Russian intelligence

151
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,479
and people around mr. Trump and lately

152
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,729
news that mr. Trump leaked sensitive

153
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,990
Israeli intelligence that he was not

154
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,419
supposed to share with anyone

155
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,160
outside the United States to the Russian

156

Manchester don't you think that this is

160
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:03,140
a proof another proof that the Western

161
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:06,169
intelligence is not supplying the shield

162
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,870
the protection the citizen deserve yeah

163
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:11,210
well first let me begin by welcoming the

164
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:14,630
panel I think it's a great topic for

165
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:17,150
discussion I also want to again say

166
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,640
publicly that my condolences go to the

167
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,260
family members who lost loved ones and

168
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,280
those who were wounded in the attack in

169
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:27,710
Manchester which was even more evil than

170
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,960
the average terrorist attack because it

171
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,870
really targeted children I mean it's

172
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,530
it's about as as nefarious as you can

173
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,610
imagine um let me begin by saying this

174
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,039
intelligence actually doesn't protect

175
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,620
people intelligence provides information

176
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:45,380
to those who have the responsibility to

177
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,570
protect and many of the quote failures

178
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,159
you've described are not failures of

179
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,740
what I would say our collection or

180
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,870
analysis they're failures of people

181
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,900
either to operationalize what they were

182
00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:00,440
told or failures to appreciate the value

183
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,909
because of people being wedded to their

184
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,140
own narrative or their own view of

185
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:08,150
events so I'll give you some examples

186
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:11,390
you talk about the issue of rise of Isis

187
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,190
I think a significant part of the

188
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,080
problem there was I'm going to be

189
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,930
critical of my own country the

190
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,270
administration at the time was wedded to

191
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,700
a narrative that they were putting out

192
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,219
that bin Laden is dead terrorism is done

193
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,780
we want to look how great we are and as

194
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,640
a consequence as the professor said

195
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,520
terrorism is not no no like irrelevant

196
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,799
and and I think therefore they were

197
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,659
perhaps induced to overlook the signs

198
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,939
they were getting from the intelligence

199
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,159
community that actually terrorism wasn't

200
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,260
done it is simply morphed to the next

201
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,160
iteration then there are problems with

202
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,380
opera operationalizing intelligence

203
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,329
someone is in fact identified and then

204
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,980
they can't follow through with it and

205
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:54,740
again the open reporting on Manchester

206
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,310
is that the individual who appears to be

207
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,590
the suicide

208
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,569
Baumer was on the radar screen in fact

209
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,460
people in the community identified him

210
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,910
as someone who's becoming radicalized

211
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,430
they looked at him and because all they

212
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,310
could do is either decide is he can he

213
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,719
be arrested or not and once they said he

214
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,390
couldn't be arrested he they kind of

215
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,070
stopped and I think how do you deal with

216
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,910
that issue of someone who's not

217
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,470
committed a crime yet but is maybe

218
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,029
gestating a crime I think that's a

219
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,550
challenge of operationalizing

220
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:28,040
intelligence and then finally you do

221
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,829
have cases where something is mr. the

222
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,439
analysis is incorrect but I think it's

223
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,150
important not to put it all on the

224
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,870
intelligence community and in the case

225
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:40,550
of Manchester I think the failure to

226
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,310
appreciate you have to have a way to

227
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,949
monitor people even if you can't arrest

228
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:50,239
them I think that was really where there

229
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:52,040
was maybe a lapse Thank You mr. Shue two

230
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,390
quick questions what is the level of

231
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,699
alert in the Netherland now following a

232
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:02,990
Britain's elevation to their threat

233
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:05,600
alert level tools to critical and second

234
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,910
think that some of what secretary

235
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,770
Chertoff just referred need to have

236
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,900
better legislation or at least different

237
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:15,050
legislation in that legislation might

238
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:17,089
lead to some violation of basic human

239
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,150
rights what are you doing in a little

240
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:22,339
well first of all the set level in the

241
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,920
Netherlands is what you call substantial

242
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:28,760
it's a we got a five-point system and

243
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,990
it's on four it means that there's a

244
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,339
real chance of an attack in the

245
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,580
Netherlands but so do you have a

246
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:36,740
specific info specific Intel suggesting

247
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,690
that there might be an attack now if we

248
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:42,920
have specific info that's five it's five

249
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:45,459
okay and then it's critical and after

250
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,189
the UK we didn't went from four to five

251
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:50,599
and we discussed it of course every time

252
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,390
and something happens we discuss it

253
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:59,170
every time we look very critical at the

254
00:10:53,390 --> 00:11:03,260
way we define our readiness but the UK

255
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:06,620
Manchester did not affect our system

256
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,780
because we could not put a link to the

257
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:12,170
Netherlands so far

258
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:16,640
certainly not in relation to our alert

259
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:20,180
level and and to go back to your

260
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,530
question how many people if you can give

261
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,900
us the number how many people you have

262
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,030
that are marked as dangerous under

263
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,400
surveillance on any kind of scrutiny in

264
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,569
the Netherlands well as intelligence

265
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,360
normally does we don't give those

266
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,110
figures but we have no journalist fears

267
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:39,410
it's just you know I'm absolutely sure

268
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:44,680
it's it's on TV right although it's

269
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:47,480
closed-circuit now but we have 280

270
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:53,270
foreign terrorist fighters into the

271
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:56,870
Syriac area related to Isis probably 180

272
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,720
190 are still there and when Isis is

273
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,800
going to be scattered one day or another

274
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,430
it will not be defeated it will be

275
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,290
scattered they will probably return to

276
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,479
Europe return to the Netherlands or they

277
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,599
will stay in that area or they will go

278
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,960
to another fighting area like Libya for

279
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,640
example in SPD legislation well our

280
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,320
legislation here the question Elizabeth

281
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,400
let me put one other thing I mean we

282
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,250
also look at radicals and reser that we

283
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,319
were called to ask the question to lost

284
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,000
panel member but there is a relation

285
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,130
between extremism and terrorism although

286
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,590
it's it's not not extremist it's going

287
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,610
to be a terrorist but it's very

288
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:38,360
important to look at radicals and to

289
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,540
extremists and we think in the

290
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,490
Netherlands we have about a few hundred

291
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,319
direct followers of the foreign

292
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:50,030
terrorist fighters and relation to Isis

293
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,950
and probably thousand 1500 which we care

294
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:56,660
about let's put it that way and it

295
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:59,720
didn't do anything wrong um and we are

296
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:03,380
very closely looking in that before we

297
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,850
go to the legislation I want to say

298
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,189
something about Michael Chekov also

299
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,680
mentioned I mean we are looking into

300
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,330
people who didn't do anything so from

301
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,939
the law enforcement from the police over

302
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,500
the prosecutor we cannot act so

303
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,720
therefore we have intelligence but we

304
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,720
also have something different and it's a

305
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,509
case management at the local level we

306
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,870
identify people who we worry about and

307
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:29,699
then we we talk and the police and

308
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,740
prosecutor is involved but local

309
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:33,599
community local government is the most

310
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,600
important player together with education

311
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,600
social welfare parents neighbor policing

312
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,990
and seeing how can we intervene before

313
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,279
they really radicalize and if they

314
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,170
really radicalize and if you become a

315
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,019
danger if you think that they are going

316
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:51,149
to travel to a Syria Iraq or some other

317
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,529
place as a foreign terrorist fighter we

318
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,709
will probably intervene with police and

319
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:58,290
someone so that's very important and as

320
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:02,310
of now actually today in this newspapers

321
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:05,310
there is a big debate whether we are not

322
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,649
violating privacy in in discussing these

323
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,239
people who didn't do anything but just

324
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:12,209
took attention of government because

325
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,680
they may be could be radicalizing and we

326
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,920
think we are on the right path because

327
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,508
if we if you don't intervene they will

328
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,729
probably radicalize even further so

329
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,709
there may be refuted that when you say

330
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:24,569
it's a plan sorry for interrupting

331
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:27,569
so when you say intervene it means

332
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:30,029
calling them for some sort of a

333
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:31,649
conversation a conversation or talk with

334
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:35,059
their teachers or talk with a sports

335
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:37,740
club or so that we that we somehow

336
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:40,230
before punishing them maybe a little bit

337
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,930
of help would prevent them from becoming

338
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,720
radicalized I think it's a carrot and

339
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,029
stick approach mr. Frank we have

340
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,160
witnessed a series of attacks against

341
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:53,100
private and government institutions

342
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,839
cyber attacks Microsoft is also under

343
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,149
attack

344
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,860
well Microsoft we have a fairly

345
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:01,290
ubiquitous footprint and so our

346
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:05,069
customers are there's a number of

347
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,879
customers that we have and and number is

348
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:09,449
an understatement

349
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:12,990
yes the our products are widely used and

350
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:15,930
and so the most recent wanna cry attack

351
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,209
did impact many of our customers just to

352
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,430
tell the audience wanna cry is the virus

353
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,258
that attacked many medical institutions

354
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:25,079
in Britain and worldwide last two weeks

355
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:29,939
ago right wanna cry was you know has the

356
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:33,029
story of apparently the u.s. NSA had

357
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:33,839
discovered a vulnerability we don't know

358
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,439
when

359
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:41,180
and also we don't know when they lost

360
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:47,160
control of it but we do know it appeared

361
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:51,959
with a with a black hats group on the

362
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:55,079
web and we then believe that it was some

363
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:57,900
nation state that weaponized the code

364
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:01,560
and released it just about three weeks

365
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:05,459
ago and there's a few different issues

366
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,170
there but one of them is we've long

367
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,060
encouraged governments when they

368
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,540
discover vulnerabilities in software

369
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,939
that work collectively all better off if

370
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,579
they're disclosed responsibly to the

371
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,610
vendor so that they can be patched and

372
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:25,140
in fact you know so we did learn about

373
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:28,200
this and issued a patch in March and and

374
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,150
so machines that were patched windows

375
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,700
sevens machines were not vulnerable to

376
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:36,329
the attack Windows 7 machines that were

377
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:40,590
not patched were vulnerable to it

378
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,690
Windows 8 Windows 10 machines the kernel

379
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,550
had been hardened so they weren't

380
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,640
susceptible to the attack but there's

381
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:50,810
the issue of responsible disclosure and

382
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,770
and then there's the other issue of

383
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:58,380
what's reportedly a state actor

384
00:16:54,770 --> 00:17:01,319
attacking civilian infrastructure and

385
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,870
and there's there's good work going on

386
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,890
the Dutch government is sponsoring a

387
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,569
study along with east-west Institute and

388
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:15,630
the Institute for International Studies

389
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:18,089
or studies and the hague the UN group of

390
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,709
government experts is is also trying to

391
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,409
come out of the report the next few

392
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:25,320
weeks with some norms about government

393
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:29,760
conduct and those are very important

394
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:32,429
steps to take because I think we can all

395
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,020
agree that there's really no point I

396
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,940
mean government should not be attacking

397
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,129
civilians and civilian infrastructures

398
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,030
or banking infrastructure's especially

399
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:44,910
times of peace but as we've we spent

400
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,560
some time working on this but but they

401
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,250
are being attacked and the question

402
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,879
still

403
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:54,200
do you think that private companies

404
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:57,299
private individuals should get state

405
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,530
defense as they have you know policeman

406
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:01,049
patrolling the street and defend them

407
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:03,600
from from criminals or big companies

408
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:05,580
like Microsoft or like whatever AT&T

409
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,289
need to have their own Intelligence

410
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,000
Service to defend themselves because the

411
00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:12,090
CIA does and the FBI doesn't do that

412
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,090
well we do in fact have have an

413
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:18,470
extensive group of analysts who follow

414
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:21,980
all the advanced persistent threats and

415
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:24,630
you know so in this case you know we do

416
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,450
we're coming out with a call for

417
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,780
industry to collaborate more so that we

418
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,429
can share information and and agreed

419
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,059
responsible practices I mean first of

420
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:37,620
all it's important that technology

421
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,379
companies be trusted by pledging that

422
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:44,370
they're going to be 100% committed to

423
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,870
defend and zero percent offense and so

424
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,199
at Microsoft you know that's an easy

425
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:51,658
position for us to take similarly we're

426
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,059
not going to put backdoors in commercial

427
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:56,070
products right that's again an easy

428
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,020
position for us to take but we need we

429
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:59,908
need industry to do that well don't you

430
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,270
make note but maybe intelligence service

431
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:04,620
will in order to defend them well we're

432
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,700
not going to cooperate with it

433
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,139
right and if telogen services want to

434
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:13,409
you know what say one of the

435
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:17,130
government's are going to conduct their

436
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:19,559
intelligence work but they should not be

437
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:22,260
attacking civilians in time of peace

438
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,789
especially these broad attacks and and

439
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,580
we're trying to work more cooperatively

440
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:29,370
as an industry on attribution because

441
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,350
one of the biggest challenges is ever

442
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,049
the sir pointed finger pointing but

443
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:37,520
everybody denies that they did anything

444
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:40,530
and and yet we have a great deal of

445
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,110
scientific information from the

446
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,700
telemetry from all those windows devices

447
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:48,840
that are hooked up to the Internet and

448
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:50,840
and so we can share that with ideally an

449
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,168
independent agency can be

450
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,720
industry-sponsored

451
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:57,590
that can gather the scientific data from

452
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,029
a variety of parties and and publish

453
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,549
scientific analysis

454
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:04,649
that that will let people reach

455
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:07,168
conclusions about who's behind it and

456
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:09,918
and that can help create more

457
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:12,239
accountability in the system so that

458
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,869
governments can respond with more

459
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:19,739
confidence and and perhaps we hope over

460
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:24,539
time governments will not take some of

461
00:20:19,739 --> 00:20:25,859
these actions mr. sell me um in order to

462
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:27,330
have good intelligence you need to have

463
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,859
good people in order to have good people

464
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,139
you have you need to have good training

465
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:33,539
what according to your assessment is the

466
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:36,269
I would say the level of quality

467
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:39,149
training for intelligence operative in

468
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:41,190
Europe thank you first of all I want to

469
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:42,809
underline one clear thing where if you

470
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,759
look into the Lisbon Treaty which states

471
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:47,070
that the national security belongs to

472
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,399
the competence of the Member States so

473
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,749
this also reflects in a way that the

474
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:54,209
services the Member States themselves

475
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:57,389
have the responsibility to organize the

476
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:59,039
training the way they see fit and then

477
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,899
again having looked this from the

478
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,820
European perspective and a level we do

479
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:04,859
have a difference between the United

480
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,589
States for example where in the u.s.

481
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:09,809
there is Leitao well-founded and

482
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:12,149
long-lasting tradition in intelligence

483
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:17,309
in the intelligence culture training and

484
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:19,289
also how to let's say inform and teach

485
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,580
the intelligence users as well or you

486
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:23,099
know educate them how to use

487
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,629
intelligence in the wisest way I do feel

488
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:26,908
that also on the European level that's

489
00:21:24,629 --> 00:21:28,349
probably a thing which is done in one

490
00:21:26,909 --> 00:21:30,899
way in all the Member States I mean

491
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:33,178
there's certainly not a 1:1 size with

492
00:21:30,899 --> 00:21:35,189
which fits all I would imagine they all

493
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:37,109
have their own own systems and the

494
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,549
European level and especially in this

495
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:40,320
era when we have the Schengen Agreement

496
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,479
in place we have the free movement of

497
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,668
people we have common challenges in

498
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:47,669
Europe we have to look into what we can

499
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:49,440
do on an EU level in collaboration with

500
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:51,210
the Member States and this is exactly

501
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,539
what we tried to do over the past years

502
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:57,570
is to actually come up with a certain

503
00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:00,119
intelligence sculpture on in the EU and

504
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:03,269
among the EU institutions with the help

505
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:06,059
of the services and and as I said I

506
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:07,649
would love to see at least in Brussels

507
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:08,720
that we have a certain way of doing

508
00:22:07,649 --> 00:22:10,789
things at the

509
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,770
Slate's would be very well aware how

510
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:15,710
these things are done what do we expect

511
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,418
how we could then again contribute back

512
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,159
to the member states but indeed it

513
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,169
varies tremendously and there's a long

514
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,419
way to go this was this was a longer

515
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:25,549
diplomatic answer to my question on the

516
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:27,890
level of their training it's the salad

517
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:29,299
are they well-trained I would say that

518
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:30,679
most of the services that I have been

519
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,700
working with actually all of them are

520
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,440
very well trained

521
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,720
of course the capabilities do change

522
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,980
tremendously I mean if you take one of

523
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:39,049
the bigger member states because

524
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,940
services they certainly have much more

525
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,679
resources than like the service that I

526
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,840
know best where I served for two decades

527
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:48,230
which is a small service that relies

528
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,240
what is the sphere that needs to the the

529
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,720
better empowerment the sphere of

530
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,059
intelligence seeking vision human

531
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,830
collection of intelligence technology

532
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,690
that's probably again an issue that you

533
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,760
know you can't really give an one

534
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,220
definitive answer I mean it again varies

535
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,860
from from one service to another I think

536
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,799
one thing which might could be very

537
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,870
helpful would be that how do the how is

538
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,668
the analytical product produced what

539
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:16,850
sort of a methodology do you use this is

540
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:18,740
actually a quite safe field for those

541
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,870
services to cooperate and that's already

542
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,549
done to a certain extent and then again

543
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:25,789
in a smaller groups within the EU

544
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:27,470
member-states for example and let's say

545
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,419
like among the Nordic countries so what

546
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:32,570
have you you have similar societies

547
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,370
similar legislate legislation and and

548
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,860
the legal framework which allows you to

549
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,139
cooperate probably it much more in depth

550
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,629
than you you could with with some other

551
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,909
member states for example

552
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,770
secretary Chertoff you came to be the

553
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:47,840
Secretary of Homeland Security in

554
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,879
difficult times one of the main tasks

555
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,820
was to have a much better coordination

556
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:56,510
between different I think 14 different

557
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,189
intelligence intelligence agencies what

558
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,140
was the main thing that the main lesson

559
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:04,010
that you can inherit to your European

560
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:07,460
counterparts on coordination and well I

561
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:09,860
would say it of course it was in terms

562
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,650
of coordinating within the department as

563
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,449
the secretary I have the authority to

564
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,820
simply order people to do things so that

565
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,370
makes it somewhat easier the harder

566
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:21,289
thing is among different departments and

567
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,119
certainly harder still is across

568
00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:24,519
national

569
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:25,839
averies but i think there are another

570
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,219
things you could do first of all you

571
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,678
need to make sure you have a common

572
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:31,299
understanding not just of the threat but

573
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,669
of what it is you're trying to achieve

574
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:35,429
the tools you have to achieve it that

575
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:38,559
means for example a common language

576
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:40,659
standard approaches to things standard

577
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,609
ways of evaluating things and things of

578
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:44,859
that sort

579
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:45,879
second I think you need to do it in the

580
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,009
military is called

581
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:49,809
make sure people understand commander's

582
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:52,209
intent to understand what the mission is

583
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:54,819
what it is you have to accomplish you

584
00:24:52,209 --> 00:24:57,899
don't want to micromanage or your

585
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:59,799
components but you do want to give them

586
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:01,869
clarity about what they're trying to

587
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:05,109
achieve and also have cross

588
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:07,779
fertilization to take an example not in

589
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:12,158
the area of terrorism but in the area of

590
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:14,679
mass migration when I came in we had a

591
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,539
system where we had so many people

592
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,639
crossing the border that we were

593
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:21,339
apprehending that we didn't have enough

594
00:25:18,639 --> 00:25:22,779
space to detain them so most of them

595
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:26,739
were released and they never showed up

596
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:28,239
for hearings so we had two choices one

597
00:25:26,739 --> 00:25:30,699
is we can really spend a lot of money

598
00:25:28,239 --> 00:25:32,829
and build a lot more beds or we can

599
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:35,289
figure out how do you change the system

600
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:36,729
so that you can move people who are

601
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:38,529
apprehended who don't belong in the

602
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:41,019
country back to where they came from

603
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:43,599
more quickly and so that was the

604
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:46,359
objective and we brought in the various

605
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,668
component elements those who apprehended

606
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,519
the border those who managed detention

607
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:54,849
those who arranged for repatriation and

608
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:57,549
we looked at this as demand to end we

609
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:59,849
recognized that if we accelerated the

610
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,809
repatriation process to make it

611
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:04,688
contemporaneous with the apprehension

612
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:06,129
process we could cut by two-thirds the

613
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:08,319
amount of time it took to send somebody

614
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:10,478
back which was like tripling the beds

615
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,789
and within less than a year we'd

616
00:26:10,479 --> 00:26:14,979
eliminated the need to release people

617
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:17,369
because of lack of bed space so that's

618
00:26:14,979 --> 00:26:19,779
an example of how you coordinate and and

619
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:21,129
operationalize and objective are you

620
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:23,469
satisfied with the level of coordination

621
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:25,839
between the inside the US intelligence

622
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:27,819
community today do you think that

623
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,729
there's a much lesser risk that God

624
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:32,339
forbid another September 11 occur I

625
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:33,440
think it's far better than it was

626
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:36,049
because

627
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,409
we built a culture of sharing although I

628
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:42,230
will tell you after 9/11 there was a

629
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:44,840
real effort to get people to push their

630
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,509
intelligence out then we had the Snowden

631
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,250
episode that nobody to keep you

632
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:51,889
yeah and that question was you're

633
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,240
wasting let's keep it to ourselves and I

634
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:55,519
still think we're trying to find the

635
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,259
happy medium the good news is there are

636
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,889
some technical things that can be done

637
00:26:57,259 --> 00:27:02,570
to data that allow people to see it but

638
00:27:00,889 --> 00:27:05,209
not necessarily to download it or

639
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,750
manipulate it and those tools allow you

640
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:13,360
to put much more finely grained rules in

641
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:15,980
place when you share data and if we had

642
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,769
General Michael Hayden who works with

643
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,210
you standing here he would say and I

644
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:21,830
quote from an interview that he gave me

645
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,559
that that Snowden affair was the one

646
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:27,439
single most severe hemorrhaging in the

647
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:31,490
history of American intelligence I think

648
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,049
that's probably right and you know and

649
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:37,519
somebody put out of course was

650
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:38,960
exaggerated but it went well beyond what

651
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,070
he was complaining about which was a

652
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:46,190
particular program to collect metadata

653
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:48,049
on wide scale he put things out there

654
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,539
that touched on all kinds of issues that

655
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:53,480
have no civil liberties component but

656
00:27:50,539 --> 00:27:56,389
really seemed designed largely to damage

657
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,850
the US and its relations with allies to

658
00:27:56,389 --> 00:28:02,269
damage US companies to create a lack of

659
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,730
trust and I it will not have escaped

660
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:07,190
your notice that while he's been very

661
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,500
critical of the u.s. he's safely

662
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,799
ensconced in Russia not necessarily

663
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,179
known as the paragon of civil liberties

664
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:15,769
around the globe so you can draw your

665
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:17,690
own conclusion from there and I can

666
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:19,340
support it I was part of the their

667
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:24,049
Spiegel team that analyzed much of the

668
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:26,750
documents that Snowden stole and later

669
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:28,429
gave to some journalists and mainly and

670
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,950
probably to Russian intelligence and

671
00:28:28,429 --> 00:28:32,809
much of that did not relate to violation

672
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,220
of civil rights and there was a even a

673
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:36,710
discussion inside the group of

674
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,190
journalists and and and commentators

675
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,889
what to release bit among the 101

676
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:46,450
million point to documents that that he

677
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:51,340
leaked my case my claim was that if you

678
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:53,920
leaked documents that relate to NSA CIA

679
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,649
hunt for the real bad guys proliferated

680
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,590
Iran Hamas Hezbollah then you did

681
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,510
basically jeopardize the legitimacy of

682
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,480
the whole project I can understand a

683
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:07,840
German journalist who is somewhat

684
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,360
furious to see that the NSA is hacking

685
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,129
into the phone of the Chancellor but to

686
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,290
leak information about how the NSA is

687
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,360
following proliferators of nuclear

688
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:19,420
weapon this is something else

689
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,889
but in coordination inside the the

690
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,230
American intelligence agency is one

691
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,850
thing and and Elka's tell me to have

692
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,350
coordination inside Europe is another

693
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:31,409
thing and I have a German high rank

694
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:35,469
official said we wanted to have a

695
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:38,080
European CIA but we failed we realize

696
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:40,990
that this is not doable we are not being

697
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,110
able to share the information and to

698
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:47,020
bridge all the logistical linguistic and

699
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,840
other things so so what's next how do

700
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,000
you create CIA in Europe if you want to

701
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,070
create one indeed that's well that's

702
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,750
very much a political issue of course

703
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,340
above my very courage to decide whether

704
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,560
there's a political will to do that or

705
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:01,840
not but there are a few as I mentioned

706
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,460
there are a few limitations or legal

707
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,260
issues that we have to tackle first as I

708
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,970
said the Lisbon Treaty quite clearly

709
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,350
states that the national security falls

710
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,720
under the confidence of the member

711
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,490
states this again means that the Member

712
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,160
States will organize their security

713
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,180
whether it's countering terrorism or

714
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,660
intelligence activities what-have-you

715
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,910
the way they wish to do that at the same

716
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,580
time I truly believe that there is a

717
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:26,500
room for let's say multi multilateral

718
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,199
sharing of intelligence within the EU

719
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,650
and probably even a bit wider and there

720
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,350
is already and small nucleus in that

721
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,480
sort which is the EU since then which EU

722
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,879
intelligence and and situation center

723
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,830
which is a small team of of roughly a

724
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,290
couple of hundred of people in Brussels

725
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:47,800
today which basically shares and

726
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:49,629
assesses strategic intelligence shared

727
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,850
by the Member States they don't have any

728
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,950
collection capability of their own but

729
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,429
they do get contributions from the

730
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,480
Member States which then in turn

731
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,470
combined with open source intelligence

732
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,900
and

733
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,610
any publicly available information

734
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,289
what-have-you is produced into

735
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:07,000
assessments which are then shared with

736
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:09,700
the political decision makers on our

737
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,679
brussels level so we do have and small

738
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:14,320
let's say small team already which is

739
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,409
exists but I want to underline it does

740
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,750
not have any operational no tactical

741
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:21,610
role in that sense and this again it's

742
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,250
not only about listing Lisbon Treaty

743
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:26,500
it's also the national legislations in

744
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,750
place I mean the Devils in the detail in

745
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:32,230
this if you start looking into who shall

746
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:34,270
control the use of coercive measures in

747
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,010
one of the Member States whether it

748
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:38,080
should be done somewhere in an EU level

749
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,270
or on a national level today the answer

750
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,470
is very clear it's the national level

751
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:46,960
which decides on that I as I said I

752
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,760
served as the head of incent for five

753
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,740
years and I what what I could see over

754
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,039
those years was there actually the

755
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:56,620
willingness to share increased

756
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,539
tremendously I mean both quantity wise

757
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,520
and quality wise from the contributions

758
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:02,559
from the Member States as there was also

759
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,990
an understanding that this is an added

760
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,030
value for for some of the some of the

761
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,010
member states at least let me go back to

762
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:11,230
the fact coming from Finland and one of

763
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,840
the smaller member states I can imagine

764
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,360
that the face polish politicians as well

765
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,908
as the security authorities did benefit

766
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,340
from the contributions and assessments

767
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:23,830
that were done by by EU inson on the EU

768
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,840
level so it was a two-way street but

769
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,480
this is a starting point I do not

770
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,639
personally see that in a short or medium

771
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,159
probably not even in the long term there

772
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,220
would be a trend to go towards and

773
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:38,890
Europe you know European CIA which would

774
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,020
be an EU institution let's put it that

775
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,940
way the Dutch presidency took an

776
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:45,730
excellent initiatives some some years

777
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,409
ago to to establish and cooperation in

778
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,600
countering terrorism which is more of an

779
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:51,820
onion operational level and of course my

780
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,209
colleagues so we go so we go to dick

781
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,950
chef don't you think that you not you

782
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,700
personally but European intelligence

783
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:02,860
services are now losing the war when it

784
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,320
when we are talking about attacks inside

785
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:08,260
Europe may be in contradiction to the

786
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,120
fact that - that Isis is losing its

787
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,539
ground in in rocket

788
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:17,699
so no I think he Intel's deserves in

789
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:21,190
Europe specifically after Brussels tech

790
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:25,299
did a huge effort do rate with the

791
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:26,980
counterterrorism group which is all the

792
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:29,429
European internal servers working

793
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,740
together with Norwegian and Switzerland

794
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:35,950
they got a platform and a database in

795
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:38,140
the egg actually it was established

796
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:41,080
already after 9/11 buttons reanimated

797
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,179
and I think very successfully and the

798
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,120
information is still owned by f'ing

799
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:47,789
every National Intelligence Service but

800
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,809
the information is actually shared

801
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:51,940
because they have the platform we have

802
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:54,309
the database they have liaisons of every

803
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,890
country in a fetish secure and safe

804
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:58,990
place to put it that way and they make

805
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,419
big achievements and every intelligence

806
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:04,690
services I think it's fair to say after

807
00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:07,840
Paris after Brussels we saw in the GDG

808
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:10,750
but also in Europe or at the ECT see the

809
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,609
European characteris Center an enormous

810
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,530
amount of data certainly flowing

811
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:17,859
I mean intelligence law first month

812
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:20,169
almost was loaded I used can you if you

813
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:22,210
cannot tell us specific but do you know

814
00:34:20,168 --> 00:34:23,830
specific attacks that we're stopped

815
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,940
thanks to that flow of intelligence

816
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,710
between different countries

817
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,659
I think the DG data could work on that

818
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,250
yes and I think that some of the

819
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:31,599
arrested will taking place in European

820
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,859
countries were directly related to the

821
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,030
vehicle tttt group yes absolutely so but

822
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:39,310
it's always difficult to say if you lose

823
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:41,349
ground if you run a mix of the battle to

824
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:43,629
put it that way but I think the

825
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:46,570
intelligence services and the law

826
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:49,359
enforcement agencies and they are

827
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,950
working more together than ever and I

828
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,440
think a discussion about institutional

829
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:56,168
reform I will probably distract us from

830
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,950
really operational cooperation so we put

831
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:58,629
a lot of effort

832
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:02,169
Naza Julie this present is already

833
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:04,480
mentioned on operational cooperation not

834
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:06,790
only through the the characters group

835
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,400
but also by introducing the so called

836
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,650
roadmap on information sharing which was

837
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,180
about counterterrorism about border and

838
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,010
about organized crime because we see all

839
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:17,230
these relations and it was a very

840
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,240
practical or up map and the road map is

841
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:21,520
still the guiding principle for the e

842
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,118
use in trying to achieve operational

843
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,880
cooperation so Allah president

844
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:28,460
to confer the Maltese now and as little

845
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,349
probably probably I'm sure they will

846
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,240
take it up further yeah thank you I will

847
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:33,589
take we will take a few questions from

848
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,419
the audience in a minute just before

849
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:37,519
there John Frank is this from a

850
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:40,369
technical technological point of view is

851
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:43,038
this doable can you create one data

852
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:45,289
system one database that would bridge

853
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:47,720
the linguistic difficulties and secrecy

854
00:35:45,289 --> 00:35:51,200
so we won't end up with the Europeans

855
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,749
know then god forbid then to have all

856
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,379
intelligence agencies connected to one

857
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:59,209
single pipeline share it enjoyed and be

858
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:02,660
able to stop the next terrorist attack

859
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,220
like when you do a software development

860
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,109
project the first thing you do is you

861
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,730
sit down and figure out whatever you're

862
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:11,200
trying to accomplish what are the

863
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:13,220
requirements and and secretary Chertoff

864
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,910
working with globe sac has just produced

865
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:19,578
a paper which advances the state of the

866
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,129
art thinking about well what how should

867
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:24,230
an information sharing system work so

868
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:25,789
that you can have confidence that

869
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,440
information you're sharing is going to

870
00:36:25,789 --> 00:36:29,299
be used but not abused and you can

871
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,480
retain control over it

872
00:36:29,299 --> 00:36:38,150
it won't be passed on and I commend that

873
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:41,619
paper as the basis for you know further

874
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:44,089
work to make practical the

875
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:46,849
implementations of that but but

876
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:50,210
generally you know technology can do

877
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:53,059
most everything and and especially we're

878
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:56,269
seeing some some very good advances you

879
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:58,099
know eachine translation it's not going

880
00:36:56,269 --> 00:37:01,308
to be perfect but the application of

881
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:03,890
artificial intelligence to machine

882
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:06,859
translation has significantly increased

883
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:10,900
the accuracy to the point that it's it's

884
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:14,390
quite usable and and if we start with

885
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:18,130
again more defining a technological

886
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:20,720
standard you know as and learning from

887
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:25,759
the work done in the United States or in

888
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:28,519
Canada on different applications you can

889
00:37:25,759 --> 00:37:32,210
come up with reasonably good systems

890
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:34,910
that let you tag information that that

891
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,259
create a hash and so if you're on the

892
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,930
internet you know if you're on the

893
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:39,329
network

894
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:42,419
you can say I want to do a check on John

895
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:45,150
Frank and it'll be a hash and the other

896
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,790
side will get a hash and if the positive

897
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,710
it'll get a flag and and then you can

898
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:52,140
make a request and you know there's

899
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,319
something there but it's me that you

900
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,450
maintain confidentiality in the meantime

901
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:59,670
and there's there's lots of you know

902
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,859
good thoughtful advances applying

903
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:05,609
commercial office to off-the-shelf

904
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:07,980
technology that that are you know need

905
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:12,180
to be put together but but I'm confident

906
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,680
that the system that's outlined in the

907
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,919
paper the secretary Chertoff screw put

908
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,058
together you know it is it's not science

909
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,190
fiction it's something that can be done

910
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:22,589
and the paper towards the code towards

911
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,369
transatlantic counterterrorism center of

912
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:27,740
excellence says among many other

913
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:30,390
important things many of the failing

914
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,770
failings are identified occurred due to

915
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:35,790
problems with standardization

916
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:37,680
legislation and organizational trust and

917
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,150
your final recommendation was to create

918
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,069
a transfer clan to counterterrorism

919
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,540
center of excellence to accelerate

920
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:46,549
tactical and operational standardization

921
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:56,069
hopefully this this will happen

922
00:38:46,549 --> 00:38:58,369
questions from the audience please my

923
00:38:56,069 --> 00:39:01,200
name is Julian fort I'm from Romania I

924
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:03,059
disagree with our moderator blaming

925
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,540
intelligence services for Crimea for

926
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:06,390
Ukraine

927
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,099
I mean first of all we have to put in

928
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,828
our discussion ratio of the

929
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,299
decision-maker because in a democratic

930
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:14,220
society the intelligence services you

931
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:16,680
know always act based on protocol

932
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,240
guidance and in my opinion you know we

933
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,160
have a problem with some of the politics

934
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,979
of some of the guidance coming from our

935
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,390
decision-makers Crimea is mainly first

936
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,829
of all of failure in strategy of

937
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:27,540
thinking you know because Russia for a

938
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:29,760
very long time those concept to be a

939
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,829
weekend available country you know and

940
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,650
then we discover that they are able to

941
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:37,140
do a lot of bad things so my question

942
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,750
for the panel is how can we speak about

943
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,848
improving the results of our Delta

944
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,099
services without bringing the discussion

945
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:46,910
the role the very very important role

946
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:48,140
played by the politicians because

947
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,879
including when it comes to the fight

948
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,740
against terrorism I think that the

949
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,280
issues have to be addressed from a much

950
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:58,069
more broader perspective thinking so we

951
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,750
are talking about the interface very

952
00:39:58,069 --> 00:40:01,960
sensitive interface between the Chiefs

953
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:04,940
of the intelligence and the chief of the

954
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,849
political level secretary charter and I

955
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:11,569
gather two issues first why I'm an

956
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:14,180
agreement um a lot of blame is laid at

957
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:17,270
the door of the intelligence community

958
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,700
who are the decision-makers at one level

959
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:21,380
I think we need to educate

960
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,779
decision-makers about how to understand

961
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,329
what intelligence is it is not a crystal

962
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,440
ball it cannot guarantee you that what

963
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:30,349
you're going to know what the future is

964
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,710
and understanding the rules of the road

965
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:35,690
in terms of appreciating the value and

966
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,400
the limitations of intelligence also

967
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,799
understanding how to handle it properly

968
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,420
these are I think things we can educate

969
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:42,980
people about but I think the issue

970
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:46,849
you're raising is at a higher level

971
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,980
issue in the end it's about facing facts

972
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:51,859
that are unpleasant or difficult facts

973
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,420
and as I said earlier in the case of

974
00:40:51,859 --> 00:40:56,180
Isis but I think he's also true with

975
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,150
respect to Russia for all kinds of

976
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,109
reasons I think many decision makers

977
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,329
wanted to convince themselves that

978
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:05,180
Russia was to quote for President Obama

979
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:07,010
regional power that statement not only

980
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,960
irritated the living daylights out of

981
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,869
the Russians would probably provoked a

982
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,630
lot of bad behavior but it also again

983
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:17,029
creates a mindset where you tend to look

984
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,740
at the intelligence through the prism of

985
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:21,680
what you would like to believe is true

986
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,209
and as my late father used to say the

987
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,700
one thing you can't do is kid yourself

988
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:28,910
so I think part of what politicians need

989
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,038
to understand is they do be able to step

990
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:33,618
out of their own preconceptions and

991
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,079
wishful thinking and understand

992
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:40,599
intelligence in a more objective and

993
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,010
dispassionate way any other remarks oh

994
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,990
yeah it's a very interesting question

995
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,970
but I think it don't get yourself I mean

996
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:48,439
that's that's there's a good one

997
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:51,950
I think a professionalism of the

998
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,559
intelligence services is key to that I

999
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:56,720
as a coordinator in the Netherlands I'm

1000
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,859
right between the politicians and

1001
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,459
intelligence services and law

1002
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:02,970
enforcement

1003
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,620
and somehow we made it really you like

1004
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:05,759
to work more with the politicians or

1005
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:08,040
we're just supporting it the

1006
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,720
Intelligencer I've probably above

1007
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,509
because I'm just the middleman you might

1008
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,250
say but what is important in relation to

1009
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:17,550
terrorism is that we made an arrangement

1010
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,660
that for example the level of alert in

1011
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:20,790
the Netherlands is not a political

1012
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,509
decision but is the decision of the

1013
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:25,920
coordinate and that that's important the

1014
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:29,130
assessment we make on counterterrorism

1015
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,010
and on terrorism but we have a public

1016
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,390
and a secret it is sent out every four

1017
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,680
months together with all the

1018
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:37,379
intelligence services and it is a

1019
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,940
professional piece of paper so it's not

1020
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,620
under political influence we publish it

1021
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,470
and not the politicians so that's that's

1022
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,930
and I think that more or less helps at

1023
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,220
least in the Netherlands to create the

1024
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,870
right discussions between the

1025
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,970
decision-making in a political level and

1026
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:56,430
the professionalism of the intelligence

1027
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:58,620
services but the tools that are adopted

1028
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,390
by and I refer to white secretary

1029
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:03,390
Chertoff set before the it's not just

1030
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,770
the the the gathering of the

1031
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:07,020
intelligence but what you do with the

1032
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:09,540
intelligence the tools that are chosen

1033
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,450
how to fight against terrorism

1034
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:14,730
I usually authorized or selected by the

1035
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:18,319
political level the country I come from

1036
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:20,220
in Israel decided that it can use

1037
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:23,340
methods of targeted killing

1038
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:25,259
assassinations and tortures this is just

1039
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,990
a big decision that was taken by the the

1040
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,180
politicians and many other violations of

1041
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,890
civil of civil rights in order to defeat

1042
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,450
terrorism and I think the Israeli

1043
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:36,450
intelligence community has been very

1044
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:39,569
successful in much of its effort so mr.

1045
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:42,149
Stanley do you think that your country

1046
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:45,230
or Europe maybe should imply other tools

1047
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:47,610
for example should Europe be part of

1048
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,380
targeted assassination targeted killing

1049
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:52,520
operations of the United States and

1050
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:54,660
Britain in Syria and Iraq against Dutch

1051
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,190
as you rightly pointed out it's a

1052
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,930
political decision which I very much

1053
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,700
doubt because I think it would go very

1054
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,350
much against these are multi value is

1055
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,569
that you know the at least the EU stands

1056
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,700
for and on the behalf of Finland you

1057
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,500
know even if I I do not represent that

1058
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,850
country are there any agencies anymore I

1059
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,100
would say that very unlikely to happen

1060
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:14,170
but just if I may just very quick remark

1061
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,310
concerning the indeed the issue if let's

1062
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,230
say the early warning and the early

1063
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:18,549
action it's sometimes it's not always an

1064
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,590
intelligence failure it's always a

1065
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:22,960
question okay what then when they

1066
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:25,930
sometimes uncomfortable truth has been

1067
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,820
put on the table who acts and how and

1068
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,370
when and with what sort of a means

1069
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,530
that's that's clearly an issue and then

1070
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:34,089
more and let's say on a tactical level I

1071
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,590
would say that what we did in instant

1072
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:39,180
was that we actually started back in

1073
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:41,200
2012 a training what we call it

1074
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,690
intelligence for intelligence users

1075
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,640
which basically was in in order to make

1076
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,040
the EU level decision-makers to

1077
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,870
understand what the intelligence can do

1078
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,820
at least what what the incent could do

1079
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:52,900
for them and what sort of an means we

1080
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,720
had do you think that today they are

1081
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:58,510
less skeptical about the impact of

1082
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,770
intelligence the assistant intelligence

1083
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:01,660
can give them it certainly had a

1084
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:04,450
relative impact better educated

1085
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:06,460
politicians that says at least as far as

1086
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,080
intelligence is concerned secretary

1087
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,140
Chertoff any remark from you on the use

1088
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:15,610
of targeted killing well i experice an

1089
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:18,670
untargeted killing I mean the reality is

1090
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:22,570
if you're in war you do have to kill the

1091
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:24,550
enemy and if you can be precise and not

1092
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:29,860
have innocent people caught up in it I

1093
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:31,780
think that's a good thing mister sure if

1094
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:34,000
you capture terrorists you know that he

1095
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:35,590
is a ticking bomb he knows where was the

1096
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,110
next bomb it going to take place

1097
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:40,500
something maybe is happening in the UK

1098
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:42,400
right now would you justify the use of

1099
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:46,780
special measures during the

1100
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,920
interrogation I'm not a cop it's not in

1101
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:52,330
accord with our law yeah clears there

1102
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,220
people would say you should change the

1103
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:56,650
local situation - yeah but as long as

1104
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:58,419
their laws not change we will not do you

1105
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,670
know there was an incident and I

1106
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,650
remember when this debate was raging

1107
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,860
many years ago there was an incident I

1108
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,810
believe it was in Germany where a police

1109
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:11,230
chief apprehended the kidnapper of a

1110
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:12,670
girl the girl had been buried alive she

1111
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,260
was not going to be able to survive

1112
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:17,170
buried alive without food and water

1113
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:20,380
inadequate air and at some point in

1114
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:22,640
interrogating the kidnapper I think the

1115
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,780
police chief pulled out a gun inside

1116
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,940
to kill you if you don't tell me where

1117
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:29,000
she is which is technically the

1118
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:31,550
definition of torture and he did tell

1119
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,340
the police chief and she got there too

1120
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:37,400
late they couldn't save her but if you

1121
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,470
think about that scenario you know part

1122
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,790
of the debate about interrogation often

1123
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,310
gets into the question about whether

1124
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:46,430
it's effective or not but that's a case

1125
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:47,870
where it was effective and maybe if the

1126
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,160
police chief had pulled the gun out a

1127
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:52,190
little earlier the girl would have been

1128
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,779
saved so putting aside with the whether

1129
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:56,090
you want to a body in the law there's

1130
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,070
always a question I think people are

1131
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:01,160
going to face a moral question about in

1132
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:03,830
that circumstance how do you make the

1133
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,490
decision what do you do yeah no

1134
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:06,490
questions please

1135
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,290
yes I am my name is Brooks tigner and EU

1136
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:18,259
NATO analysts for jane's defence in

1137
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:20,509
brussels we hear a lot about how the EU

1138
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:23,050
and NATO need to step up their exchange

1139
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:26,810
of energy and if NATO is not obsolete

1140
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:32,330
yes and also that this must include of

1141
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:33,980
course cyber cyber Intel attack but the

1142
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:36,920
amount of Intel is actually exchanged

1143
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:40,010
between the two is very limited it's

1144
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,050
limited to massed information metrics

1145
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,950
about malware etc it doesn't go much

1146
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:47,090
beyond that because and I've had my NATO

1147
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:50,450
experts tell me this point-blank and

1148
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:53,240
quite recently for two reasons one you

1149
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:55,100
know that many people at the EU who are

1150
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,890
clear to NATO standards to receive it

1151
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:00,049
and secondly the --use security

1152
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:02,000
clearance procedures for vetting

1153
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:04,520
personnel lower down in the bureaucracy

1154
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,800
certainly don't meet NATO standards so

1155
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,660
my question to you mr. Sammon how do you

1156
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,670
react to that and secondly what is the

1157
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:16,370
EU doing about that and how soon thank

1158
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:19,280
you it did if I may just very quickly

1159
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:21,049
first of all they did partially I do I

1160
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,760
do agree first of all the the one thing

1161
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:25,040
with what we have with EU officials is

1162
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:27,170
that very few I think the ratio is

1163
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:29,570
something like one-fifth of the of the

1164
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,820
officials are security rated they have a

1165
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:34,010
clearance that's the starting point the

1166
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,700
second issue is indeed that well how do

1167
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:36,660
we carry out those screenings

1168
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,720
actually with the help of the

1169
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,859
member-states we always go back to the

1170
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,328
remember stating question if it's a

1171
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:45,270
Finnish citizen will go back to the

1172
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:47,940
Finnish authorities etc what we have

1173
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:51,119
just started with the Belgians last year

1174
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:52,050
actually is a screening procedure with

1175
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,359
there's a memorandum of understanding

1176
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,700
with the Belgium so that we can we can

1177
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:59,520
now really screen more of our staff with

1178
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,779
them also in it's not a security

1179
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,000
clearance as such but it's it's

1180
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,310
something a little lower than that I

1181
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,589
hope that this will help out the issue

1182
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:09,630
and indeed there is constant discussion

1183
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:12,210
between the NATO and EU what can and

1184
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:13,560
what could be shared and by whom then

1185
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:16,560
again I would say that there is a

1186
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:19,109
sufficient number of people relevant a

1187
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:21,060
level of clearance on the EU side as

1188
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:22,950
well so it's it I don't see that that

1189
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:28,170
should be the biggest bottleneck in in

1190
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:32,220
that cooperation there's not just it's

1191
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:34,050
not just a terrorist risk at look at

1192
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,299
just the economies just join us and he

1193
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:40,619
was the one of the first to warn of the

1194
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:44,220
the Russian threat to the extent that

1195
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:47,040
even Snowden was may be operated by

1196
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:49,730
Russian intelligent Jones Frank do you

1197
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,920
think do you see a state level

1198
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:54,960
cyberattacks that maybe you are able to

1199
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,650
connect to Russian or Chinese or even

1200
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,990
Iranian intelligence there's no doubt

1201
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:02,970
that there's state-sponsored cyber

1202
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:07,919
activities that should not be taking

1203
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:10,848
place and you know that we do believe

1204
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:15,270
that there ought to be a basis for

1205
00:50:10,849 --> 00:50:18,619
better attribution and and as a company

1206
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:24,060
so these governments are our customers

1207
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:28,619
and you know we have telemetry data

1208
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:31,440
we've got forensic malware analysis and

1209
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:33,869
we've got a set of information that's

1210
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,819
different from often what governments

1211
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:40,410
have from their signals intelligence or

1212
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:42,779
human intelligence and you know we think

1213
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:48,270
it's important to create some way that

1214
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:49,110
there can be objectively people can feel

1215
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,420
more confident

1216
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:54,210
about making an attribution and so

1217
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,160
whether industry it will start as

1218
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,590
industry putting standing up an

1219
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,200
organization and if governments choose

1220
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:03,120
to share that information with with the

1221
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,589
computer scientist at that organization

1222
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,190
that's fine

1223
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:11,370
but you know I think the realities are

1224
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:14,340
that you know we've seen that the Obama

1225
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:15,750
administration analysis of why they

1226
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:18,720
believe the Russians were the ones

1227
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,760
hacking the DNC it was fairly thin in

1228
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,310
terms what they actually put put out and

1229
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,810
and I think you're not sure that it was

1230
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,920
Russian military not saying that at all

1231
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:28,500
I'm just saying that governments have

1232
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,760
reasons not to disclose a great deal of

1233
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:32,940
information that may reveal their

1234
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,670
sources and methods and and so you know

1235
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:37,890
but we we can if we collectively with US

1236
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:40,760
and other major technology companies

1237
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:44,310
that observe carefully what's happening

1238
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:47,670
can share information and we can have

1239
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:50,850
that published governments can add their

1240
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:53,490
own yeah but in return the government's

1241
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:57,750
with askew or a private company that was

1242
00:51:53,490 --> 00:52:00,899
just attacked yeah to let their virtual

1243
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:03,060
spies or cops go into their systems and

1244
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:05,070
check what happened to do the forensic

1245
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:07,140
and maybe even have a legislation that

1246
00:52:05,070 --> 00:52:09,840
would permit the intelligence agencies

1247
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,819
to do the forensic post attack without

1248
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,560
notifying the company which is something

1249
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,420
that you write of course but well but

1250
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,620
they the government's can can act a lot

1251
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,690
of this informations on the open

1252
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:20,640
Internet so you can mean in a sense one

1253
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:22,380
connect one can access much of this

1254
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,299
information but we we've got a very

1255
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,680
extensive information sharing program

1256
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:30,030
where we share the threat intelligence

1257
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,720
with with national governments or their

1258
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:39,510
certs through banks and through ISPs and

1259
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:41,250
you know trying to ensure that you know

1260
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:44,640
for example botnet information shared

1261
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:47,940
because that is a source of indirectly

1262
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,319
of many of the attacks so we do publish

1263
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:52,200
a great deal of information we work

1264
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,320
closely and I've gotta say industry this

1265
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:58,410
is not something where you know we view

1266
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:00,960
it as primarily a competitive issue we

1267
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,670
view it as a in it's in the it's in the

1268
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,380
interest of our industry together

1269
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:05,910
and so the level of cooperation between

1270
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:09,210
us and people you would consider to be

1271
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:11,040
competitors is surprisingly high thanks

1272
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:14,370
you for you afraid that Russia would

1273
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:17,670
attack cyber attack the Netherland well

1274
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:23,100
afraid is not my language concerned but

1275
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:27,570
we intrigue more than three keys to to

1276
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:30,529
diplomatic now we sure that actually we

1277
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:33,900
also publish our cyber threats and and

1278
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:38,910
and we are sure that Russia China Iran

1279
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:41,150
our F cyber attacks have cyber espionage

1280
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:44,220
on our research and development

1281
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:47,250
companies our government and probably

1282
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,740
have are trying to enter our vital

1283
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:52,530
infrastructure not to act that you

1284
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:55,830
prepare to act so we are working very

1285
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:57,390
hard with our cyber security center and

1286
00:53:55,830 --> 00:54:00,830
also with intelligence services and the

1287
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:04,470
and law enforcement to build up a

1288
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:06,569
resistant detection network and also

1289
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,040
response network but we are small

1290
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:12,150
country so we have to be wise when we

1291
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:15,330
responds secretary Chertoff did you ever

1292
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:19,350
dream that Russia would metal inside US

1293
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:22,220
elections Roger I mean amateur dream is

1294
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:24,810
the right word I I can't have Irish I

1295
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:27,600
can't I can't I was shocked partly

1296
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:31,500
because having attended a globe SEC

1297
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,240
sessions over past years actually you

1298
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,940
know this has been a phenomenon in

1299
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:37,080
Central and European Western Europe so

1300
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,430
the thing that we noted to know what

1301
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,890
what would happen in two years we need

1302
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:42,899
to be in global six today well I mean it

1303
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:44,879
was actually great for morning I mean I

1304
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,770
remember going back to the states and

1305
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,420
telling people you know this is an issue

1306
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:50,490
in Europe and it's actually affecting

1307
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,410
public opinion and people looked at me

1308
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:55,379
like I was having flashbacks to the Cold

1309
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:59,250
War I think the fact that the russians

1310
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:01,230
hacked into political databases that's

1311
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:04,350
gone on for years and that's espionage

1312
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:05,300
what was different is the apparent

1313
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:07,580
release of the

1314
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:10,850
information to mold public opinion I

1315
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:13,700
don't know that it had an effect on the

1316
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:15,440
outcome but I suspect what it will do is

1317
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,540
encourage behavior like this in the

1318
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,250
future and I think I mean I was up at in

1319
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,410
front right and now I think what you're

1320
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:24,110
seeing what we take it to the next level

1321
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:26,089
would be two additional things if as in

1322
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:28,280
France they not only release things but

1323
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:30,920
they released phony things altered

1324
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:32,450
documents altered photographs that would

1325
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,000
then take it to the next level and

1326
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:36,319
finally there's a growing concern about

1327
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,870
the integrity of the voting process

1328
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,930
itself if you move to a completely

1329
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:44,779
electronic process and someone was able

1330
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:46,970
to hack into the database or hack into

1331
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,340
the network you could actually have a

1332
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:51,339
question about the election a couple of

1333
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:56,090
years ago in the Ukraine apparently

1334
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:57,650
russians hacked into the television one

1335
00:55:56,090 --> 00:56:00,200
of television networks what they were

1336
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:03,320
going to try to do was affect the way

1337
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,609
the network reported the outcome of the

1338
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,890
race where there was a pro-russian

1339
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:08,570
candidate running for president i think

1340
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:11,029
they understood at the end of the day

1341
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:13,010
when the actual votes were counted the

1342
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,900
the correct outcome would be would be

1343
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:17,540
revealed but i think what their

1344
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:20,030
calculation was is that the discrepancy

1345
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:22,279
would cause people to doubt which was

1346
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:23,660
true which was false and in many ways

1347
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,700
when you look at russian information

1348
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,020
operations i don't know that it's

1349
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,359
necessarily that they think they're

1350
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:31,910
going to persuade most people that were

1351
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,080
to putting out is true as much as it is

1352
00:56:31,910 --> 00:56:35,410
they're going to persuade most people

1353
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:38,360
nothing can be trusted and that's

1354
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:41,000
exactly the undermining of institutions

1355
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:45,890
which creates a lot of damage this is a

1356
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:47,450
global consequence and please very brief

1357
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:50,359
question to you and then a question to

1358
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:52,370
the panel um if this happens in germany

1359
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,080
will the german media run around like

1360
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:56,120
headless chickens like the american

1361
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,890
media did not realizing that the

1362
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:00,620
political system is under attack and

1363
00:56:57,890 --> 00:57:04,310
just reporting whatever has been stolen

1364
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:06,049
from the emails of the of their german

1365
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:07,640
politicians or they behave like the

1366
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:09,320
french media which behaved very

1367
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,819
responsibly and said someone's attacking

1368
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,470
our political system and we're not going

1369
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:14,900
to cooperate so why do you think about

1370
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:17,509
that my question to the panel is you're

1371
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,030
talking as if technology has stopped but

1372
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,660
yet

1373
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:22,980
we have witnessed over the last 15 years

1374
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,629
enormous technological change which has

1375
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:27,120
already turned the world of intelligence

1376
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:28,650
upside down once and I suspect it's

1377
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:30,450
going to do so again so I'd like to ask

1378
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:33,210
you just to cast your minds forward to

1379
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:35,810
five years time we've really got big

1380
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:38,460
data of facial recognition algorithms

1381
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:41,009
really worthless that with one photo of

1382
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,810
one person you can check instantly are

1383
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:45,420
they who they say they are that's going

1384
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:47,070
to make traditional cross-border human

1385
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:48,990
intelligence really difficult it's the

1386
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:51,090
end of the cover identity which has been

1387
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:54,120
the basis of intelligence since the

1388
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:56,400
Bible um it's much harder to keep

1389
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:57,930
secrets we've seen not just with Snowden

1390
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,240
with shadow breakers things that were

1391
00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:02,549
the absolute crown jewels highside

1392
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,890
protected by data diodes no way you can

1393
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:07,350
hack into that debt network and they're

1394
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:09,240
coming out of NSA and being released on

1395
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:11,759
the internet it seems it's really hard

1396
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:14,009
to collect see to keep secrets on the

1397
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,700
other hand much hard much easier perhaps

1398
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:20,040
to obtain those secrets electronically

1399
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,020
so I just I'd like to ask you to reflect

1400
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,100
on when we're talking up this in five

1401
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,390
years time what are you going to be

1402
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,730
talking about in regards to

1403
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:28,650
technological change thank you one word

1404
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:30,390
about the the coverage of the the German

1405
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,070
press which I'm not going to be the

1406
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:34,259
judge off and I don't read German but

1407
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:36,270
there was a wonderful report that was

1408
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,670
just issued cover story by decide

1409
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:41,730
holiest arcaded site that was published

1410
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:44,070
in English as well which I highly

1411
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:47,670
recommend reading about how apt

1412
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:50,100
twenty-nine cozy bear and fancy bear

1413
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:52,130
both infiltrated German parliament and

1414
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:55,020
German political system and stole

1415
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:58,320
Jigga's of information that yet didn't

1416
00:58:55,020 --> 00:59:01,500
surface there's the risk and the concern

1417
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:03,300
and the intrigue people that are fearing

1418
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,460
that this is going to be used against

1419
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:08,340
for example Chancellor Merkel in the

1420
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:11,100
upcoming elections and I want to sharpen

1421
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:14,310
and add 2 to that question are we

1422
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:16,170
witnessing following biometrics

1423
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:20,820
estimates are we witnessing the end of

1424
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:22,500
human intelligence secretary well first

1425
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,450
of all I wish III think they were app

1426
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,080
we're already seeing tremendous change

1427
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:27,629
in

1428
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:30,690
in the volume of what is collected and

1429
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:32,460
the analytical using can be made out of

1430
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:35,220
what is collected and I think in many

1431
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:37,710
ways is going to be paradise for

1432
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:40,529
intelligence agencies now you're going

1433
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:44,970
to lose human intelligence you know you

1434
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:47,550
may lose a lot of the kind of James Bond

1435
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:50,580
type of thing where someone masquerades

1436
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:52,500
as somebody else and you know goes under

1437
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:54,150
deep cover but a lot of human

1438
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,150
intelligence but estill Mountain is

1439
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:59,580
producing a jeep that value much more

1440
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:01,320
reasonable price so then the answer will

1441
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,660
be um but I do think what you'll

1442
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,130
continue to see what I think has always

1443
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:07,799
been the backbone of human intelligence

1444
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:10,590
which is people who are legitimately in

1445
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,540
a place for whatever reason whether it's

1446
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:15,020
a noble reason or an ignoble reason

1447
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:18,540
coming forward to relay information

1448
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:22,170
about what's going on so I don't I think

1449
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:25,470
you'll see changes in the way humans is

1450
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:27,060
collected and and transmitted but I'm

1451
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:29,339
confident you're going to consider

1452
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:31,440
continue to see that as an important

1453
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:34,020
dimension of intelligence okay

1454
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,270
yes please just a couple comments I mean

1455
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:38,610
I think there's two challenges a lot of

1456
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:38,880
things you mentioned as future are exist

1457
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:41,120
today

1458
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:46,650
you know the facial recognition quality

1459
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:49,440
is very good and given the given the

1460
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:53,580
power of cloud computing and the

1461
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:57,750
extensibility of data it's not hard

1462
01:00:53,580 --> 01:01:00,660
there's two challenges one is a lot of

1463
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:02,130
the commercial technologies trying to

1464
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,830
figure out how to make it work in a

1465
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:07,440
secure world figuring out how to balance

1466
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:09,720
that and you know it can be done but

1467
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,570
there's some work there the second one

1468
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:16,740
is is more on the political judgments

1469
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:20,100
and you know Democratic Parliament's

1470
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:24,029
need to make decisions about how they

1471
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:26,819
feel on on some of these issues and and

1472
01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:31,660
certainly it's technology can be applied

1473
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:35,349
to make the choice closer through

1474
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:37,808
ooh data minimization essentially and

1475
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:39,640
and so there can be there can be things

1476
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:42,760
done to advance that I did but those are

1477
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:45,368
the two areas where I see are more more

1478
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:47,920
the challenge than actually artificial

1479
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:50,740
intelligence and and and I think not

1480
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,470
right in yes or no do you think that

1481
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:56,500
there will be a day when someone will be

1482
01:01:53,470 --> 01:02:00,129
able to build a system that could cheat

1483
01:01:56,500 --> 01:02:03,609
on biometrics Oh undoubtedly there's

1484
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:06,760
always going to be I mean you know I

1485
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:08,710
guess you know one of the biometric

1486
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:12,640
indicators we all use our fingerprints

1487
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:14,980
and yet I believe was reported that the

1488
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,230
Chinese stole the fingerprints of

1489
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:19,510
everybody with a security clearance

1490
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:23,559
United States so you know how do you

1491
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:26,349
you've got every system so maybe there's

1492
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:28,140
this still functional but let me give

1493
01:02:26,349 --> 01:02:31,030
you an example of how exactly how things

1494
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,230
compensate for that so the conservative

1495
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:36,010
someone's going to take a fingerprint

1496
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:37,869
make a latex print I am advised our

1497
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:40,390
company that actually uses ultrasound

1498
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:41,710
cue identify fingerprints over there

1499
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:45,220
three-dimensional and it can actually

1500
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:46,839
even detect blood flow so a latex print

1501
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,578
is not going to work because not gonna

1502
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:50,589
have the blood flow I guess you could

1503
01:02:48,579 --> 01:02:53,619
cut someone's finger off and before that

1504
01:02:50,589 --> 01:02:56,349
let's stop slowing that but good luck

1505
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:59,170
with that as a technique well do not try

1506
01:02:56,349 --> 01:03:01,599
this at home please yes we had a

1507
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:03,250
question over there and now we are going

1508
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,500
to keep it very short short questions

1509
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:08,549
short answers sure give Izod associate

1510
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:11,920
professor well you touched upon

1511
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:14,470
transatlantic intelligence sharing in

1512
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:18,000
counterterrorism and the panel touched

1513
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:21,450
mostly on the issues at you level this

1514
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:25,240
Eurocentric view do you think it's a

1515
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:27,220
hindrance or to what extent it can be a

1516
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:30,129
hindrance in terms of considering the

1517
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:33,609
transnational nature of threats with a

1518
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:36,309
special focus I am asking that for non

1519
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:37,869
EU NATO members not on the United States

1520
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:40,089
but it can be a challenge for members

1521
01:03:37,869 --> 01:03:42,690
like Turkey for example what's your

1522
01:03:40,089 --> 01:03:44,910
opinion on that thank you yeah it's a

1523
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,350
did you just yeah just kick off with

1524
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:47,879
that I think you know the Eurocentric

1525
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:49,680
view probably also comes from the fact

1526
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,300
that you know working for the EU it at

1527
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,850
least as far as I'm concerned was the

1528
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:55,410
natural approach I do feel that when

1529
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:57,089
it's it's more than let's say outside

1530
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,730
the EU whether it's a transplant

1531
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:02,220
transatlantic dimension or otherwise I

1532
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:04,200
think then again it's still the more

1533
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:06,509
bilateral cooperation or what-have-you

1534
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:09,540
firefight between some of the partners

1535
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:11,250
then really the EU working with with

1536
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:14,730
third countries because then again as I

1537
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:16,050
mentioned the EU at today and any

1538
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:20,430
intelligence or anything which is

1539
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:22,700
remotely resembles intelligence is

1540
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:24,509
actually based on our Member States

1541
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:26,370
information and intelligence that they

1542
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:29,010
share with us so always you know the

1543
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:33,660
originators consent going back to the

1544
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:35,280
the sending agency or service normally

1545
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,960
leads to a situation that then the

1546
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,050
member states and their agencies will

1547
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,420
cooperate outside the EU on a bilateral

1548
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:43,860
basis of the way they wish so in that

1549
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:45,990
sense I don't see that there's any

1550
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,900
there's no conflict in that sense what I

1551
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:50,399
say you you level the the sharing will

1552
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,750
most likely not take place

1553
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,730
of course the conflicts could arise from

1554
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:57,720
the definition of what is a terrorist

1555
01:04:53,730 --> 01:05:00,140
and who are the common enemies question

1556
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,140
over there please

1557
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:05,970
hi I'm a who Canada from European values

1558
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,709
team check in Prague we are under

1559
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:09,930
criminal vulture program and I want to

1560
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:12,870
ask a very single thing do you think

1561
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:15,319
that let's let's say like electro

1562
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:18,569
process should be put within the

1563
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:20,490
framework of national critical

1564
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:22,290
infrastructure while I'm asking that is

1565
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:23,910
that many intelligence agencies and

1566
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:25,710
national security establishments in

1567
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:28,350
Europe are thinking in this direction

1568
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:31,530
not only about protecting the process

1569
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:33,569
itself devoting but the campaigns they

1570
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:35,580
are discussing it at training them so

1571
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:38,100
how far should intelligence agencies go

1572
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:41,190
to protect the electro process or in

1573
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:42,779
international context thank you ah tick

1574
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,910
shift could you address it with just

1575
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:47,040
just for when one remark before that I

1576
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:48,779
know that the there's a new entity in

1577
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:50,460
Israel called the National Cyber Bureau

1578
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,970
which basically

1579
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:54,810
coordinate all the cyber defense

1580
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:55,319
activities of the country and they have

1581
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:57,299
run

1582
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:00,090
and their own research and they came to

1583
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,710
the conclusion that voting an election

1584
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:03,360
should not be fully automatic and fully

1585
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:06,840
electronic they should leave with the

1586
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,210
with the notes and making a V or some on

1587
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,160
some written list and never go to a

1588
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:13,110
fully automatic because it's too risky

1589
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:17,520
diction please yeah we just had

1590
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:19,500
elections and we had a special team

1591
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,440
which was formed by intelligence police

1592
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:24,210
and my office to see with the different

1593
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:25,800
parties for the Parliament if there was

1594
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:29,640
any influence of any state actor it

1595
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:32,280
specifically Russia so we already made a

1596
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:35,310
step and in the end the the the process

1597
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,340
was there was no computer involved in

1598
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:39,920
anything or even in the counting process

1599
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:44,790
because of the fear that it might be

1600
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:46,440
influenced even on the counting but I

1601
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:51,270
think that will not work out in the long

1602
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:53,760
term so there will be intelligence and

1603
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:55,860
and others will be involved as a the

1604
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,030
election process as a part of our fight

1605
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:58,890
infrastructure because we're a

1606
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:00,900
Democratic Society and if the election

1607
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:02,940
process is in doubt in our country or in

1608
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:06,650
your country or whatever country we are

1609
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:09,740
in a real trouble at the same time

1610
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:13,590
intelligence and the way we try to

1611
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:17,129
detect state actors or otherwise

1612
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:20,070
influence the process we must make very

1613
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:21,870
clear probably by oversight or giving

1614
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:24,030
good information that we don't go into

1615
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:26,130
the content of the different political

1616
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:29,820
parties because then we will incriminate

1617
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:32,940
the process by ourselves so that's that

1618
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:40,650
will be the balance it's the women at

1619
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:43,020
the back please Cornell University the

1620
01:07:40,650 --> 01:07:45,930
panel opened with a comment about Intel

1621
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:47,730
leaks and I'm curious to hear from the

1622
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:49,230
panel that how realistic it is to rein

1623
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,480
those in and prevent those from

1624
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:55,080
happening and whether there's any

1625
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:57,360
precedent for this and what the medium

1626
01:07:55,080 --> 01:08:01,250
to longer term impacts on Intel sharing

1627
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:03,300
there would be if this continued

1628
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:05,910
secretary Chertoff are you afraid that

1629
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:07,860
following I'm adding to the question of

1630
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:08,560
the later you afraid that following the

1631
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:11,330
recent

1632
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:12,920
reports about leakage of information by

1633
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:14,509
the United States added to the media or

1634
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:18,500
by the President to foreign minister

1635
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:21,470
lavrov countries would be hesitant to

1636
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:24,200
share the intelligence with the US well

1637
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:26,090
I mean we've had leaks in the past I

1638
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,490
mean I think the bigger danger frankly

1639
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:31,279
sure was when you had massive theft of

1640
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:34,069
really highly classified stuff but with

1641
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:35,840
snow but leaks are are you know always

1642
01:08:34,069 --> 01:08:40,040
present they do create a problem with

1643
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:43,279
sharing that sometimes what's leaked is

1644
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:45,050
pretty generic and not that important

1645
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,969
and we may over classify some things

1646
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:49,460
sometimes what's leak is really merely

1647
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:51,830
and politically embarrassing but when

1648
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:54,500
you're getting to something sensitive it

1649
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:57,260
is problematic and again you can

1650
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,600
tolerate a certain amount of that but if

1651
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:03,890
it gets to be a persistent pattern it

1652
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:06,110
does have a negative impact look from a

1653
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:08,540
technological point of view one can do

1654
01:09:06,109 --> 01:09:10,029
things to lock things down bit more so

1655
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,620
they're still accessible to people who

1656
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:15,019
who might find the information useful

1657
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:18,380
but in a more limited way so they can't

1658
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:21,800
download something for example and and

1659
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:24,380
also with an audit trail of who's seeing

1660
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:26,810
something and certainly you can as a

1661
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:30,560
network administrator be looking for

1662
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:32,650
unusual patterns you know using

1663
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,430
artificial intelligence machine learning

1664
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:38,809
and so you there's low there are ways to

1665
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:45,530
try to address the risk better through

1666
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:47,390
technology please we're going to take

1667
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:50,960
two last question this gentleman Milo

1668
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:53,180
Jones visiting professor um why are we

1669
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,610
so passive in game theory tit for tat

1670
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:57,740
works well why is it democracy is under

1671
01:09:55,610 --> 01:10:00,500
attack and not the fragile societies

1672
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:02,269
that have to be at era authoritarian

1673
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:05,720
even to hold together why don't we go on

1674
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:07,730
the offensive okay and one last question

1675
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:09,440
please

1676
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:11,169
thanks Patrick Tucker defense one a

1677
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,940
question for director Chertoff

1678
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:14,780
Secretariat or excuse me

1679
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,190
we've all know we can go back to

1680
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,750
Washington DC tomorrow and we'll see

1681
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:19,400
wildly different versions of the

1682
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,239
greatest national security threat faced

1683
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,799
the United States

1684
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:25,730
pending on whether we're watching fox or

1685
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:27,409
CNN or MSNBC do you think that

1686
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:30,409
politicization of intelligence is

1687
01:10:27,409 --> 01:10:34,219
getting worse who do you think is the

1688
01:10:30,409 --> 01:10:37,030
bigger culprit there and how can the

1689
01:10:34,219 --> 01:10:38,869
intelligence community be reformed to

1690
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:40,989
affect that while still being

1691
01:10:38,869 --> 01:10:43,130
transparent and accountable lawmakers

1692
01:10:40,989 --> 01:10:45,169
signature shows when you address this

1693
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:48,769
question and then the question of

1694
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:50,449
retaliation and so I think I don't think

1695
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:52,579
the intelligence is getting politicized

1696
01:10:50,449 --> 01:10:54,710
I think you're reporting about what the

1697
01:10:52,579 --> 01:10:56,960
intelligence community says is getting

1698
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:59,150
politicized and and that's really

1699
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,590
immediate issue it's not an intelligence

1700
01:10:59,150 --> 01:11:01,460
community no true the president Trump

1701
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:04,909
would agree with you

1702
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:07,699
well I still hold to my belief I think

1703
01:11:04,909 --> 01:11:09,679
it's I think the community is not is not

1704
01:11:07,699 --> 01:11:12,110
politicized I often get blamed for that

1705
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,940
when people just don't agree with with

1706
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:18,199
what they're hearing on the issue of

1707
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:20,539
retaliation yeah that's a complication I

1708
01:11:18,199 --> 01:11:22,308
would say this to you if you go to

1709
01:11:20,539 --> 01:11:24,050
Russia they will tell you we're

1710
01:11:22,309 --> 01:11:26,389
interfering with their electoral system

1711
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:31,190
because we do things like broadcast the

1712
01:11:26,389 --> 01:11:33,139
news and have you know support democracy

1713
01:11:31,190 --> 01:11:34,820
and talk about human rights I'm not

1714
01:11:33,139 --> 01:11:36,829
being facetious they will say they will

1715
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:39,259
believe it so they think they're

1716
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:41,150
retaliating against us and that's a

1717
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:43,820
fundamental difference in worldview

1718
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:46,969
which i think is very hard to reconcile

1719
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:48,558
now if you start to ask me do we if

1720
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,929
there are particular things that are

1721
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:52,999
done in terms of hacking or damaging

1722
01:11:50,929 --> 01:11:54,619
systems or destroying them then I think

1723
01:11:52,999 --> 01:11:56,840
there are a range of measures you can

1724
01:11:54,619 --> 01:12:00,110
take for example there was the theft of

1725
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:02,179
500 million yahoo accounts and the US

1726
01:12:00,110 --> 01:12:05,150
government did indict not only to

1727
01:12:02,179 --> 01:12:07,249
criminals but to FSB officers as being

1728
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:09,230
behind that hack you can argue whether

1729
01:12:07,249 --> 01:12:11,210
an indictment is that you know

1730
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:12,768
significant in this instance but if you

1731
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:14,179
started to go after companies for

1732
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:17,269
example that we're stealing information

1733
01:12:14,179 --> 01:12:20,210
or you look to apply sanctions you have

1734
01:12:17,269 --> 01:12:21,409
a series of tools you can use but you

1735
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,960
also have to watch the issue of

1736
01:12:21,409 --> 01:12:26,440
escalation because those in glass houses

1737
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:29,630
have to be careful about throwing stones

1738
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:33,549
thank you mr. Sami if something is in

1739
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:35,840
short do you think that there's a reason

1740
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:37,909
retaliation or reasonable countermeasure

1741
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:39,619
that can be applied for example against

1742
01:12:37,909 --> 01:12:41,570
Russia to make them think that there is

1743
01:12:39,619 --> 01:12:43,670
a price tag attached to what they are

1744
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:45,590
doing well it's probably on the

1745
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:47,000
political level what deal and under

1746
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:48,949
sanctions policy and otherwise is

1747
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,610
exactly trying to convince them that

1748
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:53,928
there is a price to pay and on that

1749
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:55,098
before closing remarks just wanted to

1750
01:12:53,929 --> 01:12:56,869
tell you ladies and gentle we would like

1751
01:12:55,099 --> 01:12:58,639
to invite you to the next session on the

1752
01:12:56,869 --> 01:13:01,339
future of global free trade starting

1753
01:12:58,639 --> 01:13:03,739
here at the Danube er space after lunch

1754
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,389
at 3:30 sharp

1755
01:13:03,739 --> 01:13:07,400
they said the lunch will be served in

1756
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:09,739
the hotel restaurant on the ground floor

1757
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:11,719
and I would like to close and have very

1758
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:14,598
briefly from each one you starting with

1759
01:13:11,719 --> 01:13:16,880
L Cassell me what do you think is the

1760
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:19,130
one single step that intelligence

1761
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:23,510
agencies need to take now to make the

1762
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:25,940
world a better place if I knew that

1763
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:27,260
reply I would probably doing something

1764
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:29,360
completely different but certainly I

1765
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:30,949
mean the basis is trust of course and

1766
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:32,690
then again I think you know the main

1767
01:13:30,949 --> 01:13:34,610
issue that between the services you have

1768
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:36,259
you have trust in what I do you have a

1769
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:38,809
common understanding that will certainly

1770
01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:40,880
help things out because true trust you

1771
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:42,980
share information you share intelligence

1772
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:46,429
which is needed it's not only need to

1773
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:52,129
know it's also needs to say please I

1774
01:13:46,429 --> 01:13:55,429
would command people to take up the the

1775
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:57,260
Chertoff report globe SEC on on how to

1776
01:13:55,429 --> 01:14:00,530
build information sharing systems that

1777
01:13:57,260 --> 01:14:02,810
that meet all the equities and and try

1778
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:06,849
to advance it and see if it can be

1779
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:09,800
operationalized inshallah dick shoo well

1780
01:14:06,849 --> 01:14:11,719
yeah well I think we must not forget

1781
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:14,929
that terrorism is about undermining our

1782
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:16,520
society our open democratic society and

1783
01:14:14,929 --> 01:14:18,860
even there are texts serve a purpose

1784
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,659
that's in the mining our society so the

1785
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:22,790
worst thing and so the best thing

1786
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:24,559
intelligence and we can do is to stick

1787
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:26,989
to our core failures or open democratic

1788
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,150
society even though sometimes very hard

1789
01:14:26,989 --> 01:14:32,030
to do so because you want to just take

1790
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:33,980
your fist and punch but nevertheless I

1791
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:36,320
think it's important if we if we cross

1792
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:38,000
that line we will end up in a society we

1793
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,639
don't want to live in but and I'm not

1794
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,550
saying that we should not somehow bow a

1795
01:14:40,639 --> 01:14:46,890
little bit but we must very keen on

1796
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:49,320
stick to our values ticket agentive I

1797
01:14:46,890 --> 01:14:51,030
encourage you all to read and a couple

1798
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,490
of reports that the globe tech

1799
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:55,950
initiative is put out including one on

1800
01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:57,719
having centers of excellence if I was

1801
01:14:55,950 --> 01:15:01,620
going to suggest one thing is I think we

1802
01:14:57,720 --> 01:15:04,470
are usually quite good at tactical

1803
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:06,510
intelligence we need to invest more in

1804
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:10,080
strategic intelligence by which I mean

1805
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:13,440
looking at more broadly what are the

1806
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:15,269
core long term causes of radicalization

1807
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:18,480
and extremism and how do we combat them

1808
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:20,310
looking geopolitically at how our

1809
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,230
adversaries or rivals use not just

1810
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:25,410
military tools but a whole range of

1811
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:27,209
tools to advantage themselves someone

1812
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:30,120
raised the question earlier but we see

1813
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:32,820
with the Russians were doing coming and

1814
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:35,040
it may be that we've been so focused on

1815
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:37,380
you know preventing attacks and being

1816
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:39,390
very tactical that we've lost a little

1817
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:41,360
bit of the art of bringing a broad range

1818
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:43,920
of subject matter experts in to look

1819
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:47,130
holistically at what the threat map is

1820
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,480
and to think about it strategically so I

1821
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:50,940
think that dr. speak about all these

1822
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:54,719
banner and things and topics we are

1823
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:58,400
ending with a somewhat positive view and

1824
01:15:54,720 --> 01:16:00,720
less a gloomy assessment of the future

1825
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,629
