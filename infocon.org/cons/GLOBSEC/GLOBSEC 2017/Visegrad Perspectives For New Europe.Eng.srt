forum always impressive is to ask you is

33
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,770
there a visitor I'd perspective of a new

34
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,900
Europe is there a uniform consolidated

35
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,429
perspective you're partly hosts today

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,280
and I'm going to ask each of the three

37
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:38,369
to critique what you got wrong as you

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,869
share this perspective with us well we

39
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,700
should a perspective of new Europe is

40
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,290
the European Union's perspective for a

41
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,570
better Europe because we are part of

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,579
European Union and the way we see

43
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,169
ourselves is to be part of all the

44
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,389
European solutions and not to be part of

45
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,009
any of the European problems we are we

46
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,500
have not generated problems European

47
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,719
Union has been facing lately and we see

48
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,460
overall as constructive players in

49
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,649
finding the answers to the truth to

50
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,360
these challenges Peter what would be the

51
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,740
framework that you think it's important

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,479
what are the benchmarks are important

53
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,419
hungary has been in the news an awful

54
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,068
lot some of your brethren inside the

55
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,809
European Union are not pleased with the

56
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,850
direction of Hungary today so what

57
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,470
message do you want

58
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,329
to send them as you look forward in a

59
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,850
new Europe of what those benchmarks are

60
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,710
for all countries and how hungry is

61
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,140
either going to lag behind that or lead

62
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:27,230
in that you know our interest is

63
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,510
European Union to be strong again we

64
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,119
have to recognize that we have lost a

65
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,310
lot of competitiveness recently and I

66
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,190
think it should be an ultimate go-to to

67
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,050
regain it and I think this is the basis

68
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,300
for the debate how to get to a situation

69
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,060
when we can say that European Union is

70
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,380
strong again and our position is that in

71
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,060
order to have a strong European

72
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,519
integration you need a strong Member

73
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,500
States the thing that no other

74
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,690
authorities should be taken away from

75
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,530
the Member States so our strategy is

76
00:02:53,690 --> 00:03:00,140
that a strong integration cannot be

77
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:02,150
strong if it is based on weak Member

78
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,160
States you have to based on integration

79
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,360
on strong Member States that's how I get

80
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,010
strong that's our strategy

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,540
what if everyone's not strong but

82
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,000
everyone's you've got membership at

83
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,709
Union there's been a lot of focus on

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,260
questions about a two-speed Europe

85
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,850
vetoed you were quoted in this said that

86
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,829
would be an incredible disaster for

87
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,870
Europe but but the broad question if you

88
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:23,150
can't prescribe strength if you can't

89
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,650
just say everyone would be strong what

90
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,250
do you do to accommodate the different

91
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:29,930
features different factors different

92
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,030
domestic organization inside countries

93
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:37,670
without falling into a two-speed Europe

94
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:40,850
trap well they got easier questions but

95
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:42,350
you are bigger but you and I have it you

96
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,530
and I have a history so I felt

97
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,450
comfortable I want to say two years ago

98
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,410
we got vetoed - laughs and someone said

99
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:54,859
it was historic

100
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:57,590
I do this again I think that we have a

101
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:00,680
common history and common experience

102
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:04,520
that we were living in the divided

103
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,980
Europe for years and we do everything

104
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,220
which is possible we do not spare our

105
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,910
efforts to keep the Europe United I

106
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:16,548
think that the idea that Europe supposed

107
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:18,738
to be a multi-speed Europe two-speed

108
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:23,359
Europe whatever is the recipe for

109
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,888
disaster it's a its idea to come back to

110
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,430
the

111
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:30,749
to the part of splendid isolation of a

112
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,330
part of the Western Europe and a part of

113
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:36,400
rest of the Europe will be which will be

114
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,159
subordinated to this splendid isolation

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,330
part of Europe so I think that it's a

116
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:47,919
it's a wrong idea how to avoid this

117
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:51,039
split and separation I think we have to

118
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:55,889
think over the concept of integration

119
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:59,830
maybe the concept is too ambitious in a

120
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:01,750
political domain for instance it's so

121
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,919
easy for it's too early for instance to

122
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,080
think about the governing bodies in

123
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,029
European Union political governing

124
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,969
bodies because we have do we do not have

125
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:16,000
a criterias how to elect or how to

126
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:18,699
select this governing bodies by the

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,999
Democratic way but the democratic

128
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:24,580
institutions so I think that supposed to

129
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:27,129
be some kind of a pose right now in a

130
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,938
Europe integration some some time for

131
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:34,469
the reflection about the single-parent

132
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:37,689
market about the political concept and

133
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:40,300
first and resolve might be not the first

134
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:44,849
but simultaneously we have to think also

135
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,669
about external tracks which which have a

136
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:50,800
important influence on the on the of the

137
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,229
position of the opinion on the domestic

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,969
situation of the European Union if a

139
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,060
cough let me ask you we've had you know

140
00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:01,330
various perspectives thrown out here

141
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:04,750
none to direct and and concrete about

142
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,279
what a vision of a new Europe would look

143
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,050
like but let me ask you a somewhat

144
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,699
pointed question when when you when

145
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,919
these four nations became members of

146
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:15,279
Europe and as Europe has grown part of

147
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,859
the deal is to look at this package of

148
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,689
what I'm told or 80,000 regulations that

149
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,419
are part of the Yaqui community are and

150
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:24,069
Nations as your grow kind of do a deal

151
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,909
they get support from Europe and in turn

152
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:30,490
they change internally to fix themselves

153
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:32,199
to become more and more Europeans so

154
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,909
that so that they can fit together

155
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,849
and I'm interested in whether you think

156
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:37,610
that the visigoths nations the Czech

157
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:40,669
Republic

158
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,590
living up to that deal as you see it and

159
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:45,378
or whether there are problems today and

160
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:48,888
that deal that acumen at our needs to be

161
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:53,810
renegotiated and redefined yeah

162
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:57,020
obviously I think it is in vol 4 which

163
00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:00,550
agree Attica countries that we all

164
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:04,969
consider at the European integration

165
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:10,310
really important for or key a strategic

166
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:17,029
thing for our freedom security and

167
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:20,389
prosperity and the question is is the

168
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:24,889
European Union in its current form a

169
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:32,409
perfect body definitely not but I think

170
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:36,860
it is really important to perhaps listen

171
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:41,300
to our people concerns because what are

172
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:44,300
they what do they want from from from

173
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,419
the European integration basically they

174
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:52,969
want some edit value' beyond your state

175
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:55,370
route they want the European Union to

176
00:07:52,969 --> 00:08:01,099
bring them more security more prosperity

177
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:05,409
and obviously you cannot expect the

178
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:09,229
support of your public if you are just

179
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:12,560
not able to provide them this or you are

180
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:14,150
too slow to address the concerns of the

181
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,889
people Peter let me ask you the same

182
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,870
question I know that Hungary has been

183
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:20,779
trying to sort of deal with issues at

184
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,550
foreign universities journalists sort of

185
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:25,490
the concern about external influence

186
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,039
your your president or bond has been

187
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,439
sort of out there if you will on some of

188
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:32,899
this do you feel like the the deal in

189
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,550
joining Europe is not working for you

190
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,899
internally because part of the things

191
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:38,208
that are being challenged at least

192
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:40,130
raised are ones that were supposedly

193
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:42,218
resolved when hungry joined Europe I'm

194
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:47,060
just interested in how you see that I

195
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:48,860
mean our interest is to have a strong

196
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,229
European Union because we understand

197
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,230
Hungary can only be strong we

198
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,830
in a strong European Union so I hear a

199
00:08:54,230 --> 00:09:00,080
lot in newspapers about Hooksett and all

200
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:04,130
this kind of stupid stuff sorry to say

201
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,980
that no one wants to lead Hungary out of

202
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,450
European Union we want to be in the in a

203
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,240
stronger European Union we have our

204
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:14,570
place in the in the European Union and

205
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,190
the public support for membership of in

206
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,470
European Union is extremely high in

207
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,720
Hungary but if you ask the people just

208
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,670
as it was elaborated by our Czech

209
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,290
colleague whether we need reforms in the

210
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,870
European Union or to make it better of

211
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:33,140
course we do and is there are we facing

212
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:35,300
very let's say historic challenges yes

213
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,370
yes we are facing historic challenges is

214
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,380
that obvious that we have debate about

215
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,060
the future of Europe of course we have a

216
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,370
debate about the future of Europe

217
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,770
because we are 28 of us or will be 27

218
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,510
and it's obvious that we might see

219
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:49,610
things with a different approach when it

220
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,430
comes to such kind of historical

221
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:54,770
challenges so what I I would like to

222
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,959
avoid is that if you want to make a

223
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,819
debate and if you are out of the

224
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,170
mainstream which happens with us quite

225
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,000
often then you are immediately

226
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:04,370
considered as not European

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,500
and I think it is not a European

228
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,350
approach to consider someone is not

229
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,310
European if he or she is not

230
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,280
representing the mainstream position

231
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:16,699
because what is today mainstream might

232
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,910
not be mainstream tomorrow so my

233
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,520
position is that we should not let these

234
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,219
debates go emotional should not let

235
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,020
these debates go emotional because

236
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,360
immediately after we put these debates

237
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:31,520
on an emotional track it's impossible to

238
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,500
have a consensus at the very end that's

239
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,990
why we are always pushing for rational

240
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,530
debates and I and I understand that in

241
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:43,670
this world of media when you have like I

242
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:46,850
don't know 180 tweet possibilities no

243
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,400
Twitter or or if you have like 30 second

244
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:51,140
sound bites it's very complicated to

245
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,840
speak in a comprehensive manner and it's

246
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,340
very easy for you and and and for others

247
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,080
to say that foreign universities

248
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,840
journalists and then create a contact

249
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,970
context but it's very unfair to

250
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,460
countries very unfair to the people of

251
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,089
those countries very unfair to these

252
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,920
people because

253
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:08,569
they made a decision whom to govern

254
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,059
those countries I thought so I think we

255
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:14,959
should have much much more comprehensive

256
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:16,969
and and much more fair debates on a

257
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,410
rational basis based off common sense

258
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,029
and not emotions thank you I want to

259
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:22,939
just note that Miroslav flightcheck it

260
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:25,189
is the only member of the panel that is

261
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:27,529
on Twitter so you only had you're the

262
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:30,589
only one who has a direct prospect of

263
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:33,350
direct messaging Donald Trump for

264
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:34,910
whatever that's worth and I'm sure you

265
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,800
look forward to that opportunity be nice

266
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:38,480
with me please but but let me ask you

267
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,709
you know again you know in thinking

268
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,230
about envisioning new Europe there is

269
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:44,209
attention and and I tried to stop you in

270
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,779
the green room from coordinating a

271
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:50,420
unified answer I wanted to kind of get a

272
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:53,449
an anti collusion movement going against

273
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,949
you but if you were just sort of step

274
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:57,410
out out of your role for a minute sort

275
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:59,180
of talk about what some of the the fault

276
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,009
lines are and they may not be big ones

277
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,959
but just differences of opinion that you

278
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:05,779
that within the Vista grad group there's

279
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,430
a sort of important I would say as Peter

280
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:10,819
said sort of an important discussion a

281
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:13,099
reasonable debate what would and we can

282
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:16,699
even go outside what would you not like

283
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,309
to see evolve in this flank of Europe

284
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:21,139
because there is there is concern I have

285
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:22,850
to tell you in other parts of Europe

286
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:24,170
there was concern in the United States I

287
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,850
never raised the United States anymore

288
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,370
because I have lots of concern about

289
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,069
what's going on at home but but I'm

290
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,839
interested in what the lines are the red

291
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:35,089
lines are that you think are important

292
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,009
for your colleagues here to be aware of

293
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,319
as you talk to each other and honest and

294
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:43,129
candid ways about the democracies you're

295
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:45,559
supposed to be stewarding these four

296
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,410
countries have have brought into the

297
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,429
european union its own authentic

298
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,079
transformation experience which is

299
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:53,149
positive because we have changed our

300
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,829
countries we have learned a lot and we

301
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:58,059
offer this experience to others to learn

302
00:12:54,829 --> 00:13:01,489
from we have nothing to be like

303
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:03,199
apologizing for right as i said none of

304
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,480
the problems that european union has

305
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:10,490
been facing lately have been generating

306
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,170
in in central europe what we very very

307
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,089
strongly about the european union is the

308
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,189
ability to listen i mean many people

309
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:18,390
have make jokes about european union

310
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,949
being slow but it's a

311
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,540
actually other strengths that our

312
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,450
ability to listen to each other to

313
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,310
accommodate everyone's position and to

314
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,520
come up to up to something

315
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,290
we can all subscribe to and this is this

316
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,520
magic soft power of the European Union

317
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:39,870
but whenever this principle is abandoned

318
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,120
sorry looks like it's me but I've just

319
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:44,070
been vengeful there is your microphone

320
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,050
near the measuring up electric guy

321
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:50,160
you're gonna come back and take care of

322
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,300
that's because you tweet yeah Donald

323
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,100
Trump word yeah

324
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:58,199
so whenever we abandon these principles

325
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,850
and try to force all the Member States

326
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,860
into something that has been precooked

327
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:04,880
right it doesn't work

328
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,410
so therefore to call for mutual respect

329
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,870
and again understanding to each other's

330
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,620
position I sometimes joke but it's half

331
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:16,530
joke half true that if let's say

332
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,420
Netherlands is alone against all the

333
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:21,660
other member states it's called the

334
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,150
Dutch position but when Poland is alone

335
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,319
it's cold we have a problem with Poland

336
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:30,780
so it shows that that's true so why

337
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,520
don't we respect each other equally so

338
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,470
if you're gonna get slammed get slammed

339
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,390
specifically and get the name right

340
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,980
right that's the it's not about slimming

341
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,740
yes not about something it's about

342
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:45,300
respect it's about respect right right

343
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,430
now well Montenegro's completion of the

344
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,130
NATO membership is stuck in in the Dutch

345
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,989
Senate Ukraine's the safety zone attract

346
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,600
new that which is why he said in

347
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:57,000
attacking that no it's that it's stuck

348
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,800
in the Dutch Senate let's try to imagine

349
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,630
if it was stuck in one of our four

350
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,630
parliaments what would be the the media

351
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,610
coverage of all this so European Union

352
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,830
is a great thing and I agree with the

353
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,270
veto that it would be good to reflect

354
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,400
but the truth is we have no time to

355
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,410
reflect because what the world is not

356
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,920
working for us what I want let me just

357
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,750
finish we have one big test right now in

358
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,360
front of us which is called black seed

359
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,130
and the way we manage breaks it will

360
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,450
tell us a lot about the future of the

361
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,390
European Union right about our

362
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,760
seriousness as a global player and about

363
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:31,560
our ability to stay unity because unity

364
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,100
is the key word right now so before you

365
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,439
leave

366
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,649
and go to VTOL for a minute I was going

367
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,380
to ask all of you this about brexit is

368
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:42,269
is brexit something that has really

369
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:46,050
wounded Europe or is it something that

370
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:46,649
you feel like great great thanks for all

371
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,420
the fish

372
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:50,639
see you later Brits that it's better to

373
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,949
be get them out of out of the out of the

374
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,100
Union it's definitely bad news for

375
00:15:52,949 --> 00:16:00,779
Europe to lose an member moreover such

376
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:02,370
an important prominent member but it

377
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:05,189
will be the end of the process that will

378
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:07,560
tell us what it was because you know it

379
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,990
might be also less less than two to help

380
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,388
us to learn what what are the priorities

381
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,759
and how important for us it is to be to

382
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:18,990
be committed we focus on to be united so

383
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:20,339
yes it was a bit of Peel but let's make

384
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,290
sure that we will be able to draw

385
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,930
positive lessons for the future we

386
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,209
taught our bracket very very briefly to

387
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,540
the questions you asked

388
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:32,790
Miroslav for asking these questions you

389
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,790
were implying that there is some kind of

390
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:38,130
a pattern of democracy in in Europe and

391
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:41,819
be as efficient at countries or some of

392
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:43,470
the physical countries we are departing

393
00:16:41,819 --> 00:16:45,120
from this from this model

394
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,949
I just want say that's not necessarily

395
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:53,100
my view but it is ok big yeah I know

396
00:16:46,949 --> 00:16:54,930
yeah but that was the versus in the way

397
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,569
you are implying that just kind of a

398
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:01,459
model you know know about you know and

399
00:16:57,569 --> 00:17:04,619
the insurance about the rule of law

400
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,389
journalism university in which kind of

401
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:08,428
this this in which country well I would

402
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,860
I would say there's a both Poland in

403
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:13,260
Hungary have been the poster children of

404
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,849
concern and you don't see any problems

405
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,709
of the rule of law in other countries

406
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,559
outside of the leave me after after

407
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,350
Saudi Arabia trip I am NOT so he can be

408
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,549
still tough we still about we still

409
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:25,500
talking about the European Union

410
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,030
countries right in your pinion them come

411
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,319
no but I mean I hope better I'm asking

412
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,870
you know that poem that they said this

413
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,370
it come up so when you the broader thing

414
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:36,260
is you think about a new Europe which is

415
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:39,629
our task today are these institutions

416
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,980
feeling there's concern Venator sought

417
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,809
your president who is speaking here

418
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,460
before it's been interviewed frequently

419
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:45,510
about these same questions and I know

420
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,070
that

421
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,260
so I guess the question is as you look

422
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,030
forward are these institutions going to

423
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,020
be healthier smaller more controlled

424
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:56,790
more robust so now we can connect this

425
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,410
question with the problem of brexit

426
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:01,860
because the brexit is not only the

427
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:04,590
problem of divorce with United Kingdom

428
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,530
is not only the problem of looking for

429
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:10,050
the new position of a United Kingdom

430
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:12,090
piece of your opinion but also this is a

431
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:15,180
problem of reforming European Union

432
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,830
because for years we were concentrating

433
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,170
in your opinion on enlargement on

434
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,899
bringing additional countries you create

435
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,850
Turkey and others and suddenly we are

436
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,890
losing the one of the most important

437
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:28,980
country in Europe and of the world

438
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:31,560
the second economy of Europe the the

439
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,110
nuclear power the member of Security

440
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,480
Council so was this a kind of a

441
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:39,149
capricious decision of the British

442
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,030
society no it was the decision taking in

443
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:44,250
the democratic way so we have to think

444
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,320
and reflect in the European Union

445
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:51,030
why we lost why we are losing such

446
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:53,790
important country and if if we go to

447
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,620
answer that where we need more Europe in

448
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,139
European Union owed more European Union

449
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,879
in Europe we are not going to solve

450
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,190
anything we are not going to solve to

451
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,530
find the reason why the United Kingdom

452
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,210
decided to leave Europe so we have to

453
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,200
think we have to reflect about the

454
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:14,070
situation in your opinion about the role

455
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,800
of the Commission which is not elected

456
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,560
in a more critic way it is selected by

457
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,830
the agreement among the party about

458
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,470
among the Member States we have to look

459
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:28,110
at the position of the council which is

460
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,900
composed of the leaders democratic

461
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,520
elected in the Member States we have to

462
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,440
think about the position of the European

463
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,600
Union and the right above the European

464
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,360
Parliament and the right balance between

465
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,070
the European Parliament and the

466
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,740
parliaments of the of the Member States

467
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,320
so it's a big discussion among us

468
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,890
maybe we lead to the opening of the

469
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,530
treaties but we shouldn't concentrate on

470
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,840
some issues here in this part of Europe

471
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,000
because they are meaningless meaningless

472
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,840
comparing to the big problems of the

473
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,850
European itself

474
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,560
is there governance fix in Europe that

475
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,050
you'd like to see sort of govern a

476
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,820
governance fix you know what Peter what

477
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:10,240
we told was just raising is that there

478
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,310
are significant governance issues in the

479
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,710
way the European Union is run today if

480
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,060
you were to identify two or three fixes

481
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,330
that you think are the court well I've

482
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,980
got it all right so I think I can I can

483
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,960
approach to this answer from the

484
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,790
perspective of brexit as well because we

485
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,590
regret that decision a lot although we

486
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,360
we have to respect the decision of the

487
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,520
British people because we have to

488
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,909
recognize that it is only the British

489
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,230
people to decide about the future of of

490
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,060
UK and by the way it is only the

491
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,160
American people to decide about their

492
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,110
own president and not the international

493
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,690
media that was I think proved very well

494
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,300
so when it comes to to brexit you know

495
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:49,060
we lost the second biggest economy of

496
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,730
Europe and the fifth biggest economy of

497
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,399
the world which shows that we have to

498
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,070
fix something something doesn't work in

499
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,260
a proper way some reforms were not

500
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:02,710
completed as they should have been and

501
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:05,560
you know the the problem I see here is

502
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,900
that the personal conclusion the

503
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,700
personal conclusion was drawn on the

504
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,530
other side of the channel but the

505
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,320
personal conclusion was not drawn on

506
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:17,139
this side of the channel because that

507
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,000
outcome was not only the failure of the

508
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,470
of the British government at that time

509
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,380
but it was the failure of European

510
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:26,560
Commission as as we thought was

511
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:30,730
referring to as well so I think I think

512
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:33,610
yes there are some major major reforms

513
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,680
that should have been carried out and

514
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,530
these reforms should be based on the

515
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,030
respect towards the Member States UK

516
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,980
made it very clear what they wanted

517
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:44,170
stronger national parliaments and some

518
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,140
other and some other new phenomenon

519
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:50,440
which we actually support and we regret

520
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:53,230
that decision we think the thing that if

521
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,810
you put into consideration the latest

522
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,790
challenges as the mirror stuff was

523
00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:00,970
pointing out if you have a look at them

524
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,750
than the answers which prove to be

525
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,500
successful

526
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:08,260
we're not made in Brussels these these

527
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,630
successful answers were given by the

528
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,310
Member States so that's why I think that

529
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,530
we should not weaken we should

530
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,750
not further weaken the member states in

531
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,220
the European Union so we should not go

532
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,800
towards the United States of Europe

533
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,680
because it leads nowhere definitely not

534
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,330
to a competitive European Union so we

535
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,600
are totally against this Federalist

536
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:31,510
approach we don't think it it leads to a

537
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:36,730
competitive European Union we think that

538
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:38,710
that we should we should be more put the

539
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,270
future on Europe on the sovereign is to

540
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,370
approach having strong member states and

541
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,710
build on them a strong integration and

542
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,370
don't blame Member States according to

543
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,840
double standards because Miro rightly

544
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:55,060
pointed it out what would have happened

545
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,110
if it was Hungary not to ratify the DC

546
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,270
FTA with Ukraine

547
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,250
what have you what would you have

548
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,320
written in the international media

549
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:04,210
if Hungary would have been the one to

550
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,100
block the visa-free regime to Ukraine or

551
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,010
to Georgia what would have been written

552
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,750
and now it as it was a Western European

553
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,430
country we take it as a national

554
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,380
position so I think that these double

555
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,880
standards should not be applied in

556
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,250
European Union because until these

557
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,720
double standards are applied we will get

558
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:22,150
nowhere definitely I want to go to the I

559
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,950
need to begin making the conversation

560
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:25,420
and so you know kind of wink at me as we

561
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:27,670
go on we'll try make it informal and

562
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,400
I'll say you know this is a conversation

563
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:33,610
so make one question not three as we get

564
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,800
or one comment not ten but but the the

565
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,120
thing I'd like to say is it first I want

566
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,149
to pay respect to pull in for a minute

567
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,179
to Warsaw because I was made aware that

568
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:46,870
at the NATO building which was revealed

569
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:49,780
yesterday the 2015 NATO summit was

570
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:52,120
listed the 2017 NATO summit was

571
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,670
commemorated on the wall there was there

572
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,280
was no mention of this fantastic Warsaw

573
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:59,470
summit there was a big globe SEC forum

574
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,430
there in fact that Poland hosted and

575
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,500
Soviet old I want to give you an

576
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:08,590
opportunity and ask me do you think that

577
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:13,710
was an American plot no definitely it

578
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:16,959
was negligence of the staff of

579
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:19,720
headquarters probably but that was the

580
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,750
price was because just film have you

581
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:27,860
registered a complaint yes I wrote this

582
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:31,780
exhibition actually the war so 2016

583
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:34,340
between 2015 2017 so this is my stamp

584
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:36,020
personal stamp on this exhibition but

585
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,250
that was a surprise for us because

586
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:42,820
couple hours before we we started this

587
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,870
opening ceremony we were received by

588
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,970
Secretary General's daughter Bank and

589
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:50,330
others and during the discussion with a

590
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:52,580
President of Poland all of these members

591
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:58,360
of the headquarters NATO headquarters

592
00:24:52,580 --> 00:25:03,020
were trying to and has the meaning of

593
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:06,889
Warsaw summit as a summit which took a

594
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:09,049
very decisive decisions on the on the

595
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,840
future of security especially over the

596
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,789
eastern flank of NATO let me remind you

597
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,428
that during the Warsaw summit we decided

598
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:19,549
to deploy troops the very first times is

599
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:23,929
the enlargement of European offer of

600
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:25,760
NATO since 1999 thousands of Americans

601
00:25:23,929 --> 00:25:27,590
and NATO troops are deployed right now

602
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,120
in Poland in the Baltic countries so

603
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:32,870
this is a huge strategic difference

604
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,989
security difference in the strategic

605
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:42,590
meaning and neglecting the excuse me

606
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:45,110
neglecting this the Warsaw summit in the

607
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:49,750
such an important exhibition which was

608
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:52,340
in front of the new NATO headquarters I

609
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,200
don't know it's a big question mark what

610
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,970
doesn't mean great and you're gonna

611
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,770
you're going to text me later that photo

612
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,909
where you wrote Warsaw in and I'm happy

613
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,010
to share with anyone it's fairly

614
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:01,669
dramatic what he did so thank you look

615
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,840
right here

616
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:07,039
tell us who you are yeah Natalie tachi

617
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,470
director of the Institute for

618
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,360
International Affairs in Rome a question

619
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,590
on the future of Europe and I'm just

620
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,600
trying to figure out whether there's a

621
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,730
bit of a difference if not division

622
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,770
going on here now we have heard a fairly

623
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,770
strong hungarian view that the future of

624
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:24,350
europe has to be about the sovereign

625
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:26,120
sort of equality of the member state a

626
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:29,299
sort of sovereignist view if you like of

627
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,729
europe we have also heard criticism of

628
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,940
polish criticism of the european

629
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,680
commission

630
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,420
the European Commission essentially

631
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,920
lacks legitimacy if I interpret you

632
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,690
correctly because it's not directly

633
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,450
elected

634
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,910
it's exactly directed not elected but

635
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:46,770
precisely so presumably the implication

636
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,320
of that is that in order for it to be

637
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,180
legitimate it should be directly elected

638
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,120
now I cannot imagine a more federalist

639
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:56,130
position than that so I'm just trying to

640
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,879
figure out exactly what is dr. Hamilton

641
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:02,430
Jefferson burea around around the planet

642
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,890
thank you comments thoughts the

643
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:07,110
sovereignty Spurs is the Federalist I'm

644
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,210
saying I'm answering briefly of course I

645
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,889
do not claim that the European

646
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,510
Commission is supposed to be elected in

647
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,160
the more cryptic way because right not

648
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,530
the possibility this is not a possible

649
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,180
way I think that because it's a select

650
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,950
that it doesn't have a democratic

651
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,810
legitimacy doesn't have a right to be a

652
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,110
institution which is monitoring a member

653
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:30,480
states it's just a guardian of treaties

654
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:33,300
just the guardian of the treaties you

655
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,830
know and it has a possibility to control

656
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:40,169
us in in the in the color of the of the

657
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:43,159
treaties nothing else to recognize I

658
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:46,290
have a possibility to create a own

659
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,990
regulation on standards and according to

660
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,379
the own standards to monitor the Member

661
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,830
States

662
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,720
Peter Premera if I don't think we're

663
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,570
focusing on real issues I mean the

664
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,430
future of Europe has been drawn by other

665
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,409
leaders and the process started here in

666
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:05,160
Bratislava last September and was

667
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:07,200
reconfirmed in Rome and the 27 leaders

668
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,790
agreed what the issues on the table are

669
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,950
and these issues are not about

670
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:14,760
federalism or sovereign ism these issues

671
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:16,770
are really about migration about

672
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,690
security about competitiveness about

673
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,490
better competitive communication with

674
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:22,590
our citizens these are the issues we

675
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,450
have to deal with plus there is a brexit

676
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,699
knocking on our door Plus what worries

677
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,560
me is the role of the European Union as

678
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,140
a global player these are three issues I

679
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,240
don't think we have and through managing

680
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,030
and solving these issues we will show

681
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,250
what European Union we have and this is

682
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,629
the way how we can shave shape and

683
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,590
influence the European Union this is

684
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,930
these are the issues we should be

685
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,830
discussing thank you very much but come

686
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,710
after

687
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:50,990
have a global position we need to keep

688
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:55,799
our house in order right back ah yeah

689
00:28:50,990 --> 00:29:00,419
you actually erased prayer quite an

690
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:02,850
important question he was thus what we

691
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:06,570
wouldn't like to see in this part of the

692
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:12,740
world as we got to the European Union

693
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:17,428
and I think I I would not like to see

694
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:21,269
moving this part of Europe its central

695
00:29:17,429 --> 00:29:25,769
Europe away from the core of Europe and

696
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:28,230
this in other words we would like to see

697
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:31,529
no fragmentation of the European and

698
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:35,940
that should be core and I don't think we

699
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:38,039
need that much that much changes as far

700
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,019
as the institutional framework is

701
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:48,539
concerned what we really need is to

702
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:50,820
fully use all those compel instruments

703
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:54,590
tools that are enshrined in the current

704
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:58,080
treaties and bring practical results

705
00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:03,899
relatively speedily to the citizens of

706
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:06,750
the European Union sandy verge pal Sandy

707
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:09,449
vershbow from the Atlantic Council like

708
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:11,700
to ask the you remember the Warsaw

709
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,970
summit right I do indeed yes one of the

710
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,019
most historic ones yeah just business

711
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:17,490
headquarters isn't finished they just

712
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:20,340
didn't get to hang that he's the father

713
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,080
of those decisions yeah anyway I asked

714
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,918
about v4 security and defense

715
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,879
cooperation

716
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:30,120
where that is never quite fulfilled its

717
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,090
promised as far but now that the Brits

718
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,399
are moving out of the EU this needs to

719
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:37,500
be a new push from among others to

720
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:39,510
strengthen the defence role of the EU

721
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,710
and even now the operational

722
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,010
headquarters has been a great under a

723
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:46,409
new name

724
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:48,419
where does the v4 stand on this issue or

725
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:49,950
do you think there should be stronger

726
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:51,779
emphasis on strengthening the NATO EU

727
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,400
partnership which also got a big boost

728
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:57,530
at the Warsaw summit Peter

729
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,170
well good to see you again thank you

730
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:02,270
very much for raising this issue you

731
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,670
know as we understood the decision of a

732
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:06,710
brexit we put the idea of the common

733
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,800
European Army on the edge and

734
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:13,130
immediately because we understand we

735
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:16,790
have to strengthen the security lag or

736
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:19,250
in Europe of the transatlantic alliance

737
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:22,280
to be very honest I've seen CNN this

738
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:25,520
morning bashing your president why he

739
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,399
raised the issue yesterday and in

740
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,160
Brussels about the defense expenditures

741
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,920
I'll tell you that whatever he said on

742
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:36,680
the North Atlantic Council he was

743
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,590
totally right I mean I really do believe

744
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:42,530
that we Europeans do have to do much

745
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:44,540
more for our own security that we have

746
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,010
been doing so far that's what you know

747
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,450
about that's why it's just wait with me

748
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,040
I'm gonna ask you to just take clear

749
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,410
four they weren't on the on the question

750
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,510
of the two percent and I people talk at

751
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,640
two percent what comes to mind to me

752
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:57,920
right away and that is thinking about

753
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,300
missions objectives and capabilities

754
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,190
that are needed that might go across

755
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,870
I've been interested in in the Czech

756
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:05,270
Republic for instance having at one of

757
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,620
its divisions roped in with the Germans

758
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,450
it's a different way to think about it

759
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,820
than money and percentages and I'm just

760
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,350
wondering are we making a mistake and I

761
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,770
just want to hear from you are we making

762
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,770
a mistake

763
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,450
talking about numbers rather than

764
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,580
capabilities and objectives that was a

765
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:22,940
decision in veils as far as I understand

766
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,439
that we have to approach to 2% I agree

767
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,630
with those ones who say that that should

768
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,060
not be the only point of measurement

769
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,100
I totally subscribe to that but but we

770
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:33,230
should not put this into parenthesis we

771
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,879
have to reach 2% we have not reached 2%

772
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:36,230
either we are far away where one point

773
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,340
zero one percent but we have a clear

774
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:42,440
plan how to get to two percent until

775
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,209
2024 of course of course I think that

776
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,520
the participation in international

777
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:48,770
missions is extremely important as well

778
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:50,750
I am proud to say the time representing

779
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:52,940
a country which is among the 27

780
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,430
countries on the globe which sends real

781
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:59,750
troops to a real fight against terrorism

782
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:01,700
we have 150 troops serving in the inner

783
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,640
bill currently we would like to increase

784
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,650
this number to 200 we hope that since we

785
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,160
are short of two or three seats two to

786
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,720
five

787
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,040
majority in the Hungarian government we

788
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,080
hope we'll get some support from the

789
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:15,560
opposition in order to increase our

790
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,270
efforts to fight against terror so we

791
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,030
hope you'll have 200 in a couple weeks

792
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,770
in in Erbil and we have been of course

793
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,600
taking part in many other missions all

794
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,160
together more than 900 Hungarian troops

795
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,959
serving outside of the country which is

796
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,880
nothing to American dimension but please

797
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,890
I'm representing a small country but

798
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,580
when it comes to your position regarding

799
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,770
security

800
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,199
I wouldn't put energy security into

801
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:37,970
parentheses either especially because we

802
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,520
are representing Central European

803
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,650
countries here where their energy

804
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,500
security is an extremely important

805
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:47,480
question and you know I really remember

806
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,430
when the European Commission killed the

807
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,470
project called South Stream which would

808
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:53,630
have been a source of diversification

809
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,700
sorry a root of diversification for

810
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,860
Central Europe saying it's a political

811
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,080
project it bypasses Ukraine it's not

812
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,870
helpful and then now what we see is that

813
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,490
North stream - as it is as it is being

814
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,439
made with the cooperation of Western

815
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,330
European energy companies and Gazprom is

816
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,100
flying so you know when it comes to

817
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,750
security then I think we should fight

818
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,250
the gains double standards in Europe mr.

819
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,418
I know you want to jump in on this but I

820
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,460
also want to ask you that the other

821
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:18,139
thing Donald Trump said yesterday was

822
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,240
that not only did he want nations to

823
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:22,100
kind of kick up to their 2% but that

824
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,259
they had a lot of past obligations they

825
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,940
owed money back for years and I just

826
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,100
love to hear your thoughts on that

827
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,389
notion are are the visited countries

828
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,639
willing to kind of dip into their

829
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:35,719
Treasuries and payback for past

830
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,879
obligations look NATO is much more than

831
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:40,939
just the sum of defence budgets of its

832
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:43,220
member states at the same time I want to

833
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:46,190
say that yes we have made our

834
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:48,259
commitments to meet the 2% benchmark

835
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,929
when we join NATO and then repeat it in

836
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:53,480
Wales and it has to be done and

837
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:55,970
everybody knows that but it's not that

838
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,100
simple because you cannot or you should

839
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,990
not cut your contributions to the

840
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,880
development assistance humanitarian

841
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,580
assistance and at the same time demand

842
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:09,200
increase the Hart security budget for

843
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:12,200
example so plus in our case 0.1%

844
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,080
increase of GDP non-defense spending

845
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,230
means 10% increase in actual figures

846
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,370
because our economy is doing well so

847
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,930
don't don't simplify this just to

848
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:25,080
figures because it's much much more than

849
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:27,930
that but to also answer to your original

850
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,610
question I do believe that European

851
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:32,370
Union should strengthen its common

852
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:34,230
security and defence policy I wouldn't

853
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,630
go as far as to speak about European

854
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:39,420
army I don't think this is in the cards

855
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:41,400
and it's needed but we need much closer

856
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,900
and stronger cooperation between

857
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,670
European Union and NATO which would be

858
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,930
based on complement at it let's get this

859
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,940
gentleman here yes are there jersey

860
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,310
fruit VA systems we're talking a lot

861
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,340
about the future and really in my

862
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,900
opinion as well I agree here the future

863
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,420
is the generation that's coming up my

864
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,740
generation as you can probably tell I'm

865
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:03,390
from England

866
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,620
and I don't armor but also you know I

867
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,540
think the other thing with you know I

868
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,000
want to add as well quick word is the

869
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,950
demographic changes and I mean I come

870
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,390
from a diverse background myself right

871
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:14,160
do you think that especially my

872
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,810
generation those changes demographically

873
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,549
coming from all sorts of areas of Europe

874
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,900
is going to mean that we become more

875
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,400
integrated because it's certainly

876
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,330
something that I would like to see and I

877
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,310
know that lots of people in my

878
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,620
generation would like to see as well I

879
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,870
want to ask Peter today he was president

880
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,640
of the young fiddly des if I had am I

881
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,009
saying it correctly the young youth

882
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,990
movement of his party there and so that

883
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:37,560
was your pathway to power so this is

884
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:40,770
your question well thank you Generation

885
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,840
well actually you know demographic

886
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:46,920
challenges we have been faced with in

887
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,110
Hungary in a let's say a very serious

888
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,390
manner and we understand this is a

889
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,770
serious challenge for the whole European

890
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,529
Union and there are some different

891
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:58,590
answers which have been put together

892
00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:00,720
I think it's Family Policy which is the

893
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,940
right answer on that but at least that

894
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,850
is what we have been trying in Hungary

895
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,120
how to make it possible for the families

896
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:12,690
to raise more kids to be in a capacity

897
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:15,450
to raise more kids so if you speak about

898
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:18,000
whether more integration is the is the

899
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:20,220
answer when it comes to the to the

900
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,500
future generations I would say yes of

901
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,839
course one of the biggest benefits of

902
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,120
belonging to the European Union is that

903
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,740
you can go to study anywhere in the

904
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,390
European Union then you hopefully come

905
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,740
back with new skills and new experiences

906
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:34,109
and contribute to the success of your

907
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,549
own country is very quickly part America

908
00:37:34,109 --> 00:37:37,019
over there and I went to we're going to

909
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:39,119
keep broadening this but but just ask

910
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:41,279
all of you in just very short form when

911
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,900
we were at the Warsaw NATO summit and I

912
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:44,519
had a conversation with sandy brown we

913
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,380
will look at the protocols that came out

914
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:48,450
of that discussion I think there were

915
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:49,470
three lines it had to do with cyber and

916
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,689
václav I know you used to do

917
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,788
cybersecurity in your one of your

918
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,739
previous roles but but it really raised

919
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:56,880
the question of in the framework that

920
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:58,410
was looked at whether you're fighting

921
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,029
old Wars thinking about old ways of

922
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,890
doing institutions and I think it gets

923
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:03,569
to this generational question of how

924
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:06,118
much of the work that we all do is

925
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:08,249
really focused on the past the past

926
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,200
institutional side that now I was

927
00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:11,999
talking to Sandy about the the wartime

928
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,649
that sort of the military planning side

929
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:15,419
of it and and I think there were three

930
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:17,190
lines on cyber and those protocols that

931
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,319
came out and when it came to sort of

932
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:21,059
looking at hybrid war in these sort of

933
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:23,489
generational changes I'm interested in

934
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:25,499
the broader concept generationally how

935
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:27,180
much inside Europe we're a prisoner of

936
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:29,509
old structures old thinking and we

937
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,529
really need to kind of go back and begin

938
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:32,849
redrafting be told I know you've talked

939
00:38:31,529 --> 00:38:35,369
a little bit about this in terms and

940
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:36,509
Poland has been a major drafter

941
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:38,880
everything from trying to look at how to

942
00:38:36,509 --> 00:38:42,660
change UN governance to other governance

943
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,970
it frameworks but is there a important

944
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,940
generational change in shift and what

945
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:50,899
might be imaginable or possible if we

946
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:55,609
escape some of these last generation

947
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:59,640
institutions well I know you were I

948
00:38:55,609 --> 00:39:02,940
don't have a twitter so yeah but in the

949
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:06,690
last election 2000 in 2015 actually we

950
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,220
we attracted a young generation my party

951
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:11,309
low justice party attracted yet

952
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,828
generation and right they using a social

953
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:16,680
media actually helped us to win the

954
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:19,140
election that was a big surprise not

955
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,259
only in Poland but in in the so-called

956
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:25,710
liberal Europe the the traditional

957
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:28,109
Conservative Party which after in in

958
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:34,109
this part of the world right after 25

959
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:36,869
years of of ideological pressure not

960
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:38,009
only survived but also there to win the

961
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:40,530
election

962
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,270
large scale and and won the election

963
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:45,210
also because of the support of the

964
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:47,670
social media and young generation so

965
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:51,540
this is a partially answer to you that

966
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:53,960
we we pay attention to this this aspect

967
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:57,570
that let me also mention yesterday

968
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,060
discussions during the there was not the

969
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:04,310
summit there was a meeting of NATO and

970
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:07,830
Donald Trump concentrated partly on

971
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:09,990
discussion of discussion on fighting

972
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:13,860
terrorism and he mentioned something

973
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:17,640
that we in the United State States in

974
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:20,430
invented internet but now they are using

975
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:23,190
it smarter and better so we have to beat

976
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:26,790
them to come back to our invention learn

977
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:29,150
better how to use it so it's a it's an

978
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:32,279
important issue just touch upon that

979
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:34,800
cyber war cyber security is very

980
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,220
important for us because everyone can be

981
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,840
affected right now not by the neighbor

982
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:42,990
but the country which is distantly

983
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:46,530
located not even by the country by the

984
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:49,560
group of group of people so and come

985
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:51,570
let's come back to this to the funding

986
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,680
so the burden-sharing you know four

987
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,800
years in nato

988
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,310
we were foolish ourselves that we have

989
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,700
to invent a smart defense intelligent

990
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:06,240
defense we were thinking about do more

991
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,669
for less no security is not granted

992
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,620
forever peace is not granted forever so

993
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,380
to keep the peace to keep the security

994
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:16,470
we have to invest and to invest in the

995
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:19,470
cyber into the security against a hybrid

996
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:21,120
war the new kind of a wars we have to

997
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,589
pay show of hands on stage are the

998
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:28,049
russians hacking into your political

999
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:30,840
system no and we already Peter yeah we

1000
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:32,820
are not living in Moore's and I'm I'm

1001
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,930
representing a small country so we got

1002
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:39,540
used to attempts of let's say attempts

1003
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:43,319
of interference external interference

1004
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:45,990
into that your our internal politics and

1005
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,490
so you're not Julian now no I mean you

1006
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,319
know we are a small country so

1007
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:51,810
definitely there are these attempts

1008
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,560
happening since we have been in

1009
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:57,600
we try to protect ourselves from them

1010
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,370
and the end of the day is the Hungarian

1011
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,720
people to make the decision back laugh

1012
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:02,339
years you were you so good at

1013
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,149
cybersecurity that Russian is not a

1014
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:10,170
problem for the Czech Republic short

1015
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:13,580
form yes or no okay

1016
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:18,510
obviously we live in Central Europe and

1017
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:21,270
there are big poppers who have interests

1018
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:23,460
also in this part of the world how you

1019
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:25,710
guys you would have to do terribly on

1020
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,500
yes/no exams I used to know it yes sir

1021
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,850
right here hello possible skeevy Sigrid

1022
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,790
Einstein magazine three copies

1023
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:35,490
downstairs available on prosperity some

1024
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:38,880
promotion just did because my questions

1025
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:40,609
about money the future of new new Europe

1026
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,020
new Europe is going to be a very euro

1027
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:45,990
will there be a position of a Socratic

1028
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:49,140
group on the eurozone or how do you want

1029
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:53,720
to keep influence your influence as the

1030
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:56,160
cigar group in the Europe that is having

1031
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,529
mercifully let me talk to you a stronger

1032
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,060
eurozone intuition here's why well we

1033
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,710
are members of eurozone right we wish

1034
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,940
all the members of the European Union to

1035
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,440
join the eurozone it would be much

1036
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:06,210
easier for us there will be no

1037
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,220
multi-speed Europe or need not no

1038
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:11,160
different groups it's about meeting the

1039
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,959
criteria making the commitments and as a

1040
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,020
matter of fact it's part of the of the

1041
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,450
commitments eurozone is the core group

1042
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,410
of the European Union this is where the

1043
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:24,390
most important decisions are made so I

1044
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:27,480
really think that it would be good for

1045
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:28,980
Europe if if the old every member of the

1046
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,920
European Union was also member of the

1047
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:34,080
eurozone yes right here

1048
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,550
good afternoon I'm your super Deputy

1049
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,900
Foreign Minister Western head soon and

1050
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,360
greetings to my colleagues and the rest

1051
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,690
of the auditorium 15 minutes talking and

1052
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,270
the vision of new Europe and we didn't

1053
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:46,590
touch upon the I would say immediate

1054
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:48,870
region for the Central Europe which is

1055
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,430
the southeastern tango for all the good

1056
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,049
work that you are doing within the

1057
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:54,750
council and especially during the Slovak

1058
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:57,210
presidency what a future of my European

1059
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:00,080
perspective of my country but we are

1060
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:02,520
facing if not mistaken couple of times

1061
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,660
European Council without conclusions on

1062
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,299
the enlargement

1063
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,420
mm is this the blueprint that is going

1064
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:11,280
to European Council to continue or there

1065
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,049
could be a more political statement

1066
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,869
within the council as regard to the

1067
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:18,690
European perspective of the Western

1068
00:44:15,869 --> 00:44:20,940
Balkans and other candidate countries

1069
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,559
okay and can I thank you very much for

1070
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,750
and can I ask the four of you in short

1071
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,819
form to address not only this question

1072
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:28,619
but Charlie kept in the former senior

1073
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:30,900
director for European affairs in the

1074
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:32,250
White House wrote a piece today in the

1075
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,920
New York Times saying that NATO should

1076
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,079
freeze its expansion as well and I'm

1077
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,730
just wondering on both those fronts both

1078
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,440
on your criteria of looking at expansion

1079
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,780
your opinion but also this provocative

1080
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,539
notion that NATO should close close the

1081
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,760
door where you are on that Miroslava

1082
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:49,410
that would be a grave mistake because

1083
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,910
you cannot take away a perspective of

1084
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,589
these countries and you cannot expect

1085
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:54,390
European reforms without European

1086
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,710
perspective and the perspective is the

1087
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,558
membership in the European Union and

1088
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:00,839
NATO so no no here and second you'll see

1089
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,369
you know it's not the most sexy topic

1090
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:04,288
now in the European Union but at the

1091
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:08,549
same time the policy is there it stays

1092
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:11,220
it's valid but yes it would be it is

1093
00:45:08,549 --> 00:45:14,538
appreciated when you provide excuse not

1094
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:17,220
to speak about enlargement and

1095
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:19,529
unfortunately your region is producing

1096
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,209
number of excuses so therefore the the

1097
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:23,369
enlargement is not featured as

1098
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,260
prominently as it was before it's in

1099
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:27,420
your hands reaction starts you know I'm

1100
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,490
coming from a country which is directly

1101
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,099
a neighbor of the Western Balkan regions

1102
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:33,959
so from our very recent history we

1103
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:36,390
exactly know the difference of the

1104
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,220
situation when there's peace and

1105
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,319
prosperity in the Western Balkans and

1106
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,029
then there's no peace and when there's

1107
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:44,099
instability in the Western Balkans so

1108
00:45:42,029 --> 00:45:46,049
that's why we see that there are are

1109
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:48,029
there are bigger and bigger tensions

1110
00:45:46,049 --> 00:45:49,950
more and more serious tensions raising

1111
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:51,569
in the Western Balkan region and we

1112
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,009
think that the best way to overcome them

1113
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:55,259
is European and your Atlantic

1114
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:59,039
integration so actually we are

1115
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:01,920
absolutely dissatisfied with with those

1116
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,049
positions which which are reflecting

1117
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,180
kind of enlargement fatigue both on the

1118
00:46:04,049 --> 00:46:08,849
side of European Union and NATO we are

1119
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:12,470
committed supporters of enlargement both

1120
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:16,559
EU and NATO and we think that that the

1121
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,609
European and euro antek inspirations or

1122
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:19,259
encouragement of the

1123
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:21,900
countries in the Western Balkan region

1124
00:46:19,259 --> 00:46:24,900
should be supported much more so we

1125
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,970
think that Serbia and Montenegro should

1126
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,140
be integrated into European Union as

1127
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:31,200
soon as possible

1128
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:33,660
the thing that Bosnia Herzegovina should

1129
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,788
be integrated into a strategic

1130
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:37,259
partnership in NATO as soon as possible

1131
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:40,130
and I really feel sorry for Macedonia

1132
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:44,430
because I think that if we had given a

1133
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:45,599
the opportunity of a quicker progress on

1134
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,118
the European and euro-atlantic

1135
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,920
integration path for Macedonia we could

1136
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:51,599
have avoided the destabilization of that

1137
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,829
country we're going to go to this

1138
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,410
gentleman here then we're going to EPP

1139
00:46:52,829 --> 00:46:57,180
the son Alec heavy here and I'm going to

1140
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,440
start calling we there are lots of guys

1141
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,980
that are putting their hands up almost

1142
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:04,289
no women are so let's fix that it's a we

1143
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,390
I just believe we don't have balance up

1144
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:08,400
here so let's have balance out here yes

1145
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,680
go ahead thank you very much my name is

1146
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,779
Peter haveli I'm from Vienna Institute

1147
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,690
for international economic studies I've

1148
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:17,849
been a little bit puzzled to hear from

1149
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:19,950
the speakers not only from your

1150
00:47:17,849 --> 00:47:22,950
microphone mr. chairman that you have

1151
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:25,410
mixed sometimes Europe and the European

1152
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:28,640
Union right and in this context I would

1153
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:32,819
put additional question related to

1154
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:35,779
enlargement what do you see about the

1155
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:39,359
European Union perspective for Ukraine

1156
00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:44,369
well I sort of VTOL point you take that

1157
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:46,019
that's this answer the question is

1158
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:48,539
related to the formal question of course

1159
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:51,269
and we are very much united as Russia

1160
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:53,160
had countries that we we think that the

1161
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:58,019
open-door policy of NATO and your

1162
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:59,700
opinion is supposed to be life and we

1163
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:02,129
concentrate not only on the Western

1164
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:03,779
Balkans or Balkans at all but also on

1165
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,309
the Eastern Partnership and this

1166
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:07,619
partnership countries are very much

1167
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:10,140
important for us especially Ukraine

1168
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:13,230
which is so a big neighbor and deserve

1169
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:16,710
to be part of Europe our position at the

1170
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:21,470
common position is that the project of

1171
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:24,809
the project of Europe Europe free

1172
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:28,169
transform democratic and safe and secure

1173
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:30,660
is not finished is not implemented so we

1174
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:34,530
have to concentrate and focus on further

1175
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:39,230
largeman to the end of the European

1176
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:43,580
borders thank you at the Sun yeah I

1177
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:46,410
wasn't so chilly last October and

1178
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:49,470
attending Valdai Club where Putin is

1179
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:52,670
dead and one of the conclusion about

1180
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:55,890
Europe that Europe is lacking a

1181
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:58,680
leadership so there is no future for

1182
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:01,549
tomorrow this is one of the conclusion

1183
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:05,940
how do you respond to that

1184
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:07,680
Wow I disagree you have a friendly

1185
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:11,970
criticism of where are the leaders in

1186
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,319
Europe and your answer Miroslav of

1187
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:15,689
course there is a future for Europe

1188
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:18,720
because this is the project that we've

1189
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:20,250
created it's the most successful project

1190
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,290
on this planet when it comes to

1191
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:24,720
political stability economic prosperity

1192
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:26,460
and the protection of human rights there

1193
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,589
is no other group of countries that has

1194
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,690
achieved such a high level in all these

1195
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,100
and many other indicators and we want to

1196
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,840
continue with this project so no one is

1197
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,360
going to take away this project from us

1198
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:38,190
we have our problems but we are dealing

1199
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,260
with these problems and you can

1200
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:44,310
criticize this or that but I will always

1201
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:46,110
ask compared to what so and then you

1202
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:47,910
will see the supremacy in the positive

1203
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:49,620
sense of the European project that's

1204
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:51,920
what that's how we see your opinion is

1205
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:55,380
about their place about the leadership

1206
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:59,040
we have number of politicians and the

1207
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:02,400
number of leading bureaucrats they are

1208
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,860
not perfect we criticize them some of

1209
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,490
them like hell but I wouldn't replace

1210
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:11,100
any one of them by putting hmm that's

1211
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:14,580
what we call a tweetable moment yes

1212
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:18,330
Lauren or Jonathan Johnson Isle

1213
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:21,029
apropos Putin can I ask you do you think

1214
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:24,090
that there is a vie for position on

1215
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:27,060
Russia and do you think there is a

1216
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:29,880
consensus on what the threats facing

1217
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:32,580
Europe are especially with a newly

1218
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,530
elected French president and a newly

1219
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:36,090
elected friend German government by

1220
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:38,550
September this both of them are not

1221
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:40,500
threat for us first what there Michael

1222
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:41,700
none of them is a threat for us I

1223
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,080
suspected as much

1224
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,299
and but

1225
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,279
but but nevertheless there would be a

1226
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,410
temptation to look again and where we

1227
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,370
are with Russia and so he's this a

1228
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:53,980
european-wide

1229
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:56,589
question or is it something that the v4

1230
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,150
can offer something specific right can

1231
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:00,850
the v4 offer something specific a

1232
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:04,060
Miroslav the answer to your question is

1233
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:05,980
yes and no yes there is a common v4

1234
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,360
position because there is a common NATO

1235
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,520
position that there is a common European

1236
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:12,070
Union position of course when it comes

1237
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:15,430
to nuances there are slight differences

1238
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:18,820
among us but it does not change the fact

1239
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:20,710
that yes we as a part of yo and NATO we

1240
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:24,430
are part of the common position we in

1241
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:26,920
Slovakia believe that what is lacking on

1242
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,960
the EU side is dialogue H which is what

1243
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:31,180
we have on the Russia on the NATO side

1244
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,040
so I I personally believe that critical

1245
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,830
dialogue is better than the absent of

1246
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,390
options of any dialogue at all being a

1247
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:40,299
diplomat I have to believe in dialogue

1248
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:42,160
so this is our position but is that that

1249
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,480
it's not in contradiction to the

1250
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,170
existing positions of NATO and European

1251
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,140
Union

1252
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:49,300
back off quick comment on that I can I

1253
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:54,930
can agree what was just available was

1254
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:57,630
just said because there is no unified

1255
00:51:54,930 --> 00:52:00,490
position of each agreed countries on

1256
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:03,070
every aspect of foreign policy or

1257
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:06,459
European integration how we tend to

1258
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:09,010
table just issues on which we can agree

1259
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:10,420
and build upon them thank you people can

1260
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:12,520
write to you the next question of it yes

1261
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,990
Theresa Phelan Center for Russia Europe

1262
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,360
Asia studies a quick question about

1263
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:18,700
European unity last July there was a

1264
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:20,350
statement issued by the EU it was held

1265
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:23,049
up for three days mostly because of

1266
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:24,670
Hungary taking the Chinese position so

1267
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:27,130
it was on the arbitral tribunal decision

1268
00:52:24,670 --> 00:52:29,800
on July 12 and the EU gave a statement

1269
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:32,080
on July 15th if when I introduced a lot

1270
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,390
of detail okay but I'm sorry so the

1271
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,000
Hungarians actually were very Pro China

1272
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:38,650
and after the EU issued a statement and

1273
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,270
I haven't found any other examples

1274
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:42,400
the Hungarians issued a separate

1275
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:45,610
statement which made federica mogherini

1276
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:47,530
crazy and so how do you talk about

1277
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:50,020
European unity when hungry actually

1278
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,850
takes statement separate and some have

1279
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,860
interpreted as a way for China to

1280
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:55,240
actually buy an EU statement thanks

1281
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,830
Peter I wondered how we were going to

1282
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,189
bring China into this discussion and I'm

1283
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:01,480
really

1284
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:03,339
happy weeks out down there so no I can

1285
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:06,460
understand people who are really fed up

1286
00:53:03,339 --> 00:53:08,440
with these simplified pro or counter

1287
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,270
positions we are not pro Chinese you are

1288
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,819
not pro anyone we are pro Hungarians and

1289
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:15,310
sometimes yes our position may differ

1290
00:53:12,819 --> 00:53:18,279
from the others but why don't you ask

1291
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:20,020
why in Netherlands have not implemented

1292
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,599
the free trade agreement with Ukraine

1293
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:24,040
for almost a year I mean isn't it the

1294
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:25,960
problem but it's a problem that we

1295
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,569
sometimes we have a separate position on

1296
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:32,170
China our position is the following that

1297
00:53:28,569 --> 00:53:34,839
China is is becoming one of the biggest

1298
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:37,990
economies of the road is it Europe's

1299
00:53:34,839 --> 00:53:40,450
interest to be able to build a pragmatic

1300
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:44,020
cooperation with China my position is

1301
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:46,149
yes our our understanding is that the

1302
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,950
phenomenon that the capital is flowing

1303
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:51,040
from west to east looking for cheap

1304
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:53,560
labor is over now the capital is flowing

1305
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,180
from east to west more and more

1306
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,759
successful Chinese Japanese Korean

1307
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,919
companies are increasing their market

1308
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,480
shares in Europe looking for investment

1309
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,230
do we have to

1310
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:08,740
or should we carry out a let's say

1311
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:10,510
pragmatic cooperation with China yes I

1312
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:13,660
don't think so and do I think that

1313
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:17,109
sometimes European Union tries to

1314
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:19,149
lecture countries which it shouldn't yes

1315
00:54:17,109 --> 00:54:20,920
I do think so so a dot with that

1316
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:22,960
statement we were absolutely not happy

1317
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,030
and can I ask you why we should have

1318
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,270
agreed with that if we have not agreed

1319
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:30,910
with that you write and drink alright

1320
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:32,740
thank you yes right here thank you and

1321
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,750
we're getting fast lightning around here

1322
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:39,868
fast questions fast answers Parliament

1323
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:43,000
in an opposition in Hungary mention

1324
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:45,430
Macomb just a couple of minutes ago and

1325
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,869
he has very outspoken and very

1326
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:51,578
progressive and strong ideas of how the

1327
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:54,010
future of the European should be and

1328
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:55,810
very ambitious plans mr. Lloyd Jacque

1329
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:58,119
you said that you would be happy that

1330
00:54:55,810 --> 00:55:00,549
all the big red countries would join the

1331
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:03,359
eurozone and would go ahead so I really

1332
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:06,190
wonder what the other countries are

1333
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,380
saying about that specifically that you

1334
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,370
are more or less all worried about that

1335
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,860
there

1336
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:15,540
viescha grad countries may stay in the

1337
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:21,760
periphery of the EU Thank You Thomas

1338
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:25,570
well we calculated very the situation

1339
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:28,300
economical such a situation and four

1340
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:31,150
years I think that we are not going to

1341
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:34,390
be part of eurozone you are not going to

1342
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:36,250
accept a Europe currency for a number of

1343
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:41,080
reasons the first one is economic reason

1344
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:43,570
it's right now much better off for the

1345
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:46,380
economy of this size like Poland to stay

1346
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:49,780
away for the eurozone eurozone is

1347
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:53,860
progressing in a speed of more or less

1348
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:57,550
1% we are developing ourselves right now

1349
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:59,230
in the speed of 4% so it's obvious it's

1350
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:02,350
obvious calculation that this is not a

1351
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:04,980
good idea to join and to accept this

1352
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:07,839
euro currency the second problem is that

1353
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,630
joining the eurozone we will lose some

1354
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,640
instrument of economic development right

1355
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,560
of sovereignity so this is another

1356
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:17,230
second problem why we want to keep it

1357
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,330
because as a country as a column which

1358
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:22,300
is trying to catch up with the most

1359
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:24,940
developed economies of the European

1360
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,930
Union we need to keep our prerogatives

1361
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,670
in our hands

1362
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:29,589
thank you Peter do you want to respond

1363
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:31,540
quickly well actually we have the

1364
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,070
opportunity to respond on these

1365
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:35,380
questions in the Hungarian Parliament by

1366
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:38,470
the way my better your fun sessions no

1367
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:41,470
no I mean the yeah we are we are very

1368
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:43,689
happy that we had some support from the

1369
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:45,490
opposition regarding sending troops to

1370
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:46,990
Iraq two years back and you were one of

1371
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,310
the ones to support and I really do hope

1372
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,919
that we can count on your support this

1373
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:52,690
time as well but when it comes to the

1374
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:54,220
euro issue you know in Hungary it is

1375
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,840
being written in the Constitution that

1376
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:57,700
the national currency is foreign so

1377
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,620
whenever you want to change it you need

1378
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:02,129
the to further majority for that the

1379
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:05,799
second issue is that we have a very

1380
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:08,650
simple understanding of recent history

1381
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:11,530
of the eurozone which was that you

1382
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:13,570
should only join eurozone if number one

1383
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:16,150
you are totally ready and number two if

1384
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:17,740
your ozone is totally ready just as we

1385
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:20,050
close up in the last last few minutes

1386
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,399
and perhaps like 30 seconds each I just

1387
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:22,670
want to ask you one key question the big

1388
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,500
drama in America today

1389
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,930
is reporting about Donald Trump's

1390
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,300
failure to say that he would stand by

1391
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:32,450
Article five the the NATO commitment to

1392
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:35,450
defend all of you if you're attacked to

1393
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:38,870
see a a an attack on one as an attack on

1394
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:41,600
all and there is a enormous convulsion

1395
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:43,490
inside the United States about what that

1396
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:46,339
failure to stand by Article five means

1397
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:49,129
do you feel that the United States is

1398
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:52,100
abandoning its commitment to you do you

1399
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:53,390
see it sounds like the constant sort of

1400
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,980
will show anything do you see a world

1401
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:57,049
that you'd like to be from Donald Trump

1402
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,310
or the world as it is with regard to

1403
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:59,780
article five but I'd like to get just

1404
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:05,600
just as we close today your quick

1405
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:11,150
thoughts in closing václav no I don't

1406
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:16,339
think that the commitment of the United

1407
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:18,410
States that to NATO the alliance is

1408
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:19,430
diminishing I don't believe this so

1409
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:22,250
you're okay

1410
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:25,700
we are not okay we have to be obviously

1411
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:28,730
careful but now it is also important for

1412
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,890
us to devise a credible and and also not

1413
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:34,070
just device but also to implement a

1414
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:37,129
credible national plan and for us a

1415
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:40,730
European sees such to do more on not

1416
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:44,720
just to spend more but also to to show a

1417
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:46,280
more determination to act right AB

1418
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,310
that's it thank you Peter

1419
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,680
well I was there yesterday on the

1420
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:53,750
meeting of the NATO heads of state and

1421
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:56,509
government and what I heard there from

1422
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:58,670
President Trump was that he is committed

1423
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:01,250
to the cooperation with European allies

1424
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:02,750
he's committed to NATO he is committed

1425
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,400
to fulfil would you have liked him to go

1426
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:05,600
a little further sorry would you have

1427
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,580
liked him to go further

1428
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,370
would I have would you have liked Donald

1429
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:12,170
Trump to go further I mean I can refer

1430
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:14,569
to what he has said and he said that

1431
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:16,280
they will fulfill their obligations they

1432
00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:18,170
want Europeans to fulfill their

1433
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,510
obligations as well so whatever I heard

1434
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:22,850
from him yesterday in the meeting made

1435
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:24,440
me relaxed yeah Marisa all the

1436
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,900
optimistic interpretation of his words

1437
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,340
is that the commitment under Article

1438
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,530
five is so obvious that there was no

1439
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:33,599
need to mention it but I would still

1440
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:39,579
have preferred if it was mentioned

1441
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:44,319
Vico well I think it's artificial debate

1442
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:47,229
because because we have proofs in Poland

1443
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:49,390
of article 5 we have five thousand

1444
00:59:47,229 --> 00:59:51,640
American troops in Poland

1445
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:54,699
it says much better than just the

1446
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:56,828
clarity mentioning Article five I prefer

1447
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:58,599
to have five thousand troops from the

1448
00:59:56,829 --> 01:00:00,789
United States in Poland and this is a

1449
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:03,579
commitment that sounds like a definitive

1450
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:05,319
great way to close I should say one of

1451
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:06,819
the things the fun things I was doing

1452
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:08,380
with our panel before they came in but I

1453
01:00:06,819 --> 01:00:09,939
only got to be told in Miroslav and

1454
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,709
asked him what their hobbies were so I

1455
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,779
have no idea what Peter does for fun I

1456
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:16,989
imagine it's like hang gliding or

1457
01:00:13,779 --> 01:00:19,269
something and václav but I love the fact

1458
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:22,719
that Miroslav told me that his favorite

1459
01:00:19,269 --> 01:00:24,819
obsession is rollerskating and Vee told

1460
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,829
hobby is work work work and so between

1461
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:29,019
that we've had a wonderful conversation

1462
01:00:26,829 --> 01:00:31,089
both both both fun and obviously very

1463
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:32,529
serious before I thank you I wanted to

1464
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:34,269
