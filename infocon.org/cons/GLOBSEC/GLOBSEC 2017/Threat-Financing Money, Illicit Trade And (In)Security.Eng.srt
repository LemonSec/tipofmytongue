00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,889
good good afternoon ladies and gentleman

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,369
can you hear me okay

4
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,770
am i clear and I'll try to speak as

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,119
slowly as possible giving my giving my

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,380
brother regional accent Belfast come for

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:26,789
some complaints about that last night

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,130
but I blame that on the very great

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:33,690
Slovak appear so anyway here we are

10
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:39,300
gonna discuss a very important subject

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:41,339
the lethal nexus between terrorism and

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,339
crime and indeed the funding of

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,270
terrorism the expansion of the terrorist

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,289
war chest through criminality I'm

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,320
brought under the subject because I

16
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,149
write about it occasionally over the

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,910
last three decades I've worked for

18
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,649
various news organizations from the BBC

19
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,569
to the Guardian and The Observer

20
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,979
newspapers and in many ways what

21
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,380
happened in Northern Ireland in Ireland

22
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:11,220
during the the conflict called the

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,610
troubles in many ways it's a excuse me

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,500
why you're from theater it presses what

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,420
was happening in the 2020 of 21st

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:23,369
century in terms of the nexus between

27
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,890
crime and terrorism so for example we in

28
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,909
hardened pioneered the whole use of

29
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:33,270
smuggled fuel to fund the IRS campaign

30
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,090
for instance and a whole range of

31
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,939
counterfeit and illicit goods that again

32
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,040
was pretty much pioneered in areas like

33
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,979
South Armagh North life on the Irish

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,540
border during the conflict now we have a

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,049
number of experts here today on the

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,220
panel who are going to discuss this new

37
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:52,200
connection between criminality and

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,189
terrorism so I'll introduce you to our

be our panel introduce and start talking

72
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,370
and we have a good discussion in the

73
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,049
studio we're going to have a look at a

74
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:21,519
video now which shows what we're up

75
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:24,220
against in terms of the trade in illegal

76
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,790
goods and criminality that funds the

77
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:30,060
Terrorism of the 21st century so let's

78
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,060
have a look

79
00:03:42,410 --> 00:04:18,029
[Music]

80
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:21,840
okay so a little visual food-for-thought

81
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:24,448
there but the the threat and and also hi

82
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,659
it's funded Peter there's a report in

83
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:32,220
the London Times today which says that

84
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:35,340
20 are 23,000 jihadists living in the

85
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,130
United Kingdom two questions is that

86
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,109
exaggerated and if it is are we talking

87
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,000
about not just active terrorists with

88
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,570
maybe their supporters especially those

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,509
in the financial field the number

90
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,090
strikes me as very high previous numbers

91
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:53,610
were typically around a thousand five

92
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,888
hundred to two thousand I think that's a

93
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,320
lot more realistic I don't see how that

94
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:01,650
figure would have increased tenfold in

95
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,719
the last one or two years so I would

96
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,599
have to read the article to figure out

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,720
exactly what is meant by that figure are

98
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:12,560
these actually potentially violent

99
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,510
extremists or are they also people from

100
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,060
this you know kind of supporters

101
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:21,240
sympathizers or indeed people who may

102
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,060
help sometimes inadvertently with the

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,099
funding and Finance can you just hold on

104
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,300
or not inadvertently in what sense oh we

105
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:29,460
talking about people who collect money

106
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,830
food money do they think is a good cause

107
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,780
a charity that may end up in the coffers

108
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,020
of Isis that's what we used to say I

109
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,359
think one really interesting and as far

110
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,389
as European jihadists are concerned new

111
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,199
phenomenon is that emerging nexus

112
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,090
between crime and terror and people who

113
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,919
are being caught up in terrorist

114
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:53,940
networks like the people in Manchester

115
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,849
to a very significant degree have pasts

116
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,669
in criminal networks so for example if

117
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:02,039
we look at official figures from various

118
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,780
countries two-thirds of the German

119
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,490
foreign fighters two-thirds of the

120
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,008
people who went to Syria in order to

121
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,639
join Isis and similar groups two-thirds

122
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:15,360
have criminal convictions in the case of

123
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:19,110
the Netherlands France Norway it is over

124
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,550
50% that is different from what it used

125
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,410
to be maybe 10 or 50

126
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,990
years ago when that was the exception

127
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,210
rather than the rule and has important

128
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,400
consequences in terms of how these

129
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,219
people radicalized it has important

130
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,698
consequence in terms of the significance

131
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,319
of prisons as breeding grounds it

132
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,030
facilitates terrorist operations because

133
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,870
these tip these people typically have

134
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:45,388
easier access to weapons they're used to

135
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,610
violence so radicalization trajectories

136
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:50,520
happen more quickly and of course in

137
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,889
terms of the funding quite often what we

138
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,650
see in relation to the funding of

139
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:58,889
terrorist plots is that they are funded

140
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,349
by means of quote unquote ordinary

141
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,620
criminality by drug-dealing

142
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:06,990
trades and counterfeits and all the

143
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,690
range of criminal activities that these

144
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,740
people in a previous life used to carry

145
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,930
out for profit

146
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,229
now they carry them out in order to fund

147
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:18,330
terrorist operations haunts the Northern

148
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,949
Ireland experience about fuel smuggling

149
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,889
is interesting because it was one of the

150
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:25,650
major means to bring in revenue to fund

151
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:30,740
the IRS armed conflict that may be over

152
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:36,020
but can you explain how Isis and dice

153
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:39,599
have zoomed in on the fuel industry to

154
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:41,758
fund their campion find the Caliphate

155
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,259
and beyond yeah I mean I would not say

156
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,060
that they assumed into the industry on a

157
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,819
global scale right there they assumed in

158
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,800
on the production in Syria by basically

159
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,550
conquering all the oil fields in Syria

160
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,419
and one oil field in Iraq as a funding

161
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:59,159
stream so the good news is due to quite

162
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,198
sustained sustained military operations

163
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,770
over the last year and a half that has

164
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,569
been cut by half it's still as far as we

165
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:10,500
can see the the greatest income source

166
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,840
for ISIL core in Syria and Iraq but it's

167
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,310
come down from from from quite

168
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,340
significant levels of hundreds of

169
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,520
millions per month to about tens of

170
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,719
millions per month which is good news

171
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,049
but we are dealing with the war economy

172
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:28,680
so there is a captured market that

173
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,860
requires fuel and gas inside Syria so so

174
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,630
I so we'll always have a market for that

175
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,950
kind of product and then it of

176
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,200
course while losing territory its income

177
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,990
is diminishing what is always a little

178
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,020
bit under under snot understood is that

179
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:49,740
also the costs are reducing so if you

180
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:52,290
are holding Ramadi Fallujah as cities

181
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,060
you of course can extort the local

182
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:57,240
economy to a large extent but you also

183
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,400
have to run Ramadi and Fallujah which is

184
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,740
significant costs that I involved and so

185
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,959
if eyes now transforms into a less of an

186
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,060
emphasis on holding territory and more

187
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,700
emphasis on external attack and building

188
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,099
a global network to that extent the

189
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,750
income it does have from hydrocarbons

190
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,460
and others it is still more than

191
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,080
sufficient to do that but it seems to me

192
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,080
if that's the case that if they have

193
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,880
tens of millions that's reduced quantity

194
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,240
than what they had before that in terms

195
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,310
of running campaigns and the outside of

196
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,860
the Middle East they come from very very

197
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:31,170
long time absolutely and it is actually

198
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,940
preparing for for that long run at the

199
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,469
moment so there are a few moves that

200
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,680
we've seen where the organization

201
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,210
adjusts obviously it's communication

202
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,890
internally has gone into encrypted space

203
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,710
which was something that you could

204
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:46,110
expect they dodged the the command

205
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,360
control downward so it's no longer very

206
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,860
hierarchical operations where the top

207
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,280
knows everything that's going on but

208
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,530
it's delegated a relationship

209
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,030
responsibilities downwards and it is

210
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,339
actually sending out money and

211
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,199
potentially even individuals out of

212
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,760
Syria in Iraq so a year and a half ago

213
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,280
anyone who wants to leave Isis got

214
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,140
executed as a traitor now that's no

215
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,400
longer the case there are first

216
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,160
indication that people are actually

217
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,930
getting coached on what to say if they

218
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,189
cross the border and what they wanted to

219
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,510
be extradited to once they've of Iraq

220
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,830
and Syria in order to ensure that they

221
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,800
are not going to get arrested

222
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,660
so it's placing people around the world

223
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,339
already and it does the same thing with

224
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,439
the money obviously still financing

225
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,860
every single month it's affiliates in

226
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:35,490
particular Yemen Afghanistan West Africa

227
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,830
as well as Somalia but it's also placing

228
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,420
money outside these areas of conflict

229
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,180
and in trying to invest them in the

230
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,010
licit economy apparently in order to

231
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,989
prepare for the day we're holding

232
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,730
territory in Iraq and Syria is not going

233
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,760
to be the money producing

234
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,280
aspect for the organization anymore

235
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,980
obviously we saw on the video products

236
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:59,790
and one of them was the product that

237
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,710
your corporation is behind globally in

238
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,260
Ireland in places like Italy we had a

239
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:07,530
mafia involved in illicit trade in

240
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:12,300
tobacco how much has an organization

241
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:14,850
like Isis got into the racket thank you

242
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,530
for the question every just before

243
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,810
answer the question just let me explain

244
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:21,420
why Philip Morris International producer

245
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:24,270
cigarette is here today I mean the

246
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,400
reason is pretty simple is that every

247
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,280
pack of cigarettes sold illicit

248
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,199
illicitly it's one pack less that we

249
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,300
sell so we have an interest a business

250
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,140
interest in order to reduce this illicit

251
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:40,530
trade and the illicit trade like oil or

252
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:43,080
this little cigarette is a simple and

253
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,510
easy commodity to trade in simply

254
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,150
because they're easily available they

255
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,040
transport very well they are not

256
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:54,120
perishable you can slow them and

257
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:58,290
therefore it makes them a very useful

258
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:02,400
commodity for organized crime to to use

259
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:04,439
to give you some an example some numbers

260
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,699
if you buy a container of cigarettes in

261
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:12,300
some place of the world which could be

262
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:13,650
Vietnam Uruguay Bello Russia Dubai

263
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,319
different place of the world you can buy

264
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:18,569
a container for maybe 100 or 20,000 US

265
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,900
dollars you smuggle that container into

266
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,550
a high price country like Europe and you

267
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,680
can make two million dollars so the

268
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:29,250
return on investment is extremely high

269
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,979
and the risk of being caught ending up

270
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:34,410
in jail is very low so organized crime

271
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,940
use user cigarettes as I mean to fund

272
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:37,530
themselves that's what we see and

273
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,970
they're expert in this panel which are

274
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:45,660
more qualified myself to speak about it

275
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:48,900
very much that the Terrorism are also

276
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,910
getting involved in even if Isis to make

277
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,980
that example are against smoking they

278
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,900
are quite okay if the cigarettes past

279
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,529
the territory and they get a cut on the

280
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,999
on the transit

281
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:03,219
so I don't think the majority of illicit

282
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,959
trade don't get me wrong is ending up in

283
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:07,059
the mind of terrorists by all means but

284
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,419
even if it's only a small percentage I

285
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:12,339
think that's already a very important

286
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:14,109
and something that we should counter and

287
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:15,819
it's not only about the the big money

288
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:19,209
that the terrorists can make but also

289
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:20,738
the money did the small cell or

290
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,618
terrorists can make if you take the

291
00:13:20,739 --> 00:13:25,389
example of a the one that happened in

292
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:27,669
France a couple of years ago of a

293
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:30,159
Charlie Hebdo one of the terrorists that

294
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:32,739
was financing himself by selling a fake

295
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,989
Nike shoes once again a product which is

296
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:36,609
easily available easily to find you're

297
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:42,039
not going to make big big money but it's

298
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:44,169
enough to fund his apartment food and so

299
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:46,929
on you're not looking at big money - for

300
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:47,889
these cells to operate but the product

301
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:50,169
like a cigarettes

302
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:54,399
it is something available and so it's

303
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:56,529
easy for them to use for making a some

304
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,539
money into to finance themselves ok so

305
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:00,309
it's not only the big money the big Isis

306
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:02,049
but it also did that terrorist that's a

307
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:04,419
good point to put the patient at a small

308
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:06,789
level as well on this tiny cell of

309
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:09,879
terror unit somewhere in Europe or

310
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:11,439
beyond Keith's up I covered a court case

311
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:14,229
a few years ago in Belfast about a

312
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:15,608
jihadist from Algeria I and he was a

313
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:17,409
very prominent character but he's very

314
00:14:15,609 --> 00:14:18,849
much under the radar lived in Dublin and

315
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:20,949
Belfast wasn't carrying out attacks on

316
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:22,569
the island but was planning other stuff

317
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:24,069
in Europe and North America two

318
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:26,319
interesting points about the kiyose one

319
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:29,108
was he was a master bomb maker we do say

320
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:31,509
explosives officer shoeing haha he with

321
00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:33,299
his device could destroy a plane but the

322
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:36,309
second thing was he was he had a mini

323
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:38,139
factory producing fake credit cards

324
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:41,139
which would be used around the world by

325
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:44,229
his Britain me by his comrades in what

326
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:47,829
was an al-qaeda what is the level of

327
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:49,899
that kind of abuse of an illicit cards

328
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:52,839
and the theft of cards how is that being

329
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:54,249
how did they operate in terms of our

330
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:55,959
guest transport the question about in

331
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:57,879
terms of impact that we see with the

332
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:59,978
MasterCard in terms of through global e

333
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,429
it's such a very very small percentage

334
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:05,439
and 0.00 something of the value that's

335
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,299
moving in the payment systems but I

336
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:08,738
guess cervezas point of view you know it

337
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,079
doesn't take a lot of money to commit

338
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:12,140
somebody

339
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,140
and I recognize that and I think Peter

340
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,640
mentions as well the lot of the the

341
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,860
people to move into terrorism they've

342
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,380
got criminal backgrounds now and so what

343
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,450
would will recognize is some of the

344
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,610
financial crimes are out there so credit

345
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,260
card fraud and the payment for all in

346
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,500
terms of the legal systems has always

347
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,030
been seen as a low impact crime and so a

348
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,040
lot of comers have enjoyed that that

349
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,839
ability to commit crime the risk is

350
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,599
lower all generally high in same it's in

351
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,280
terms of buying tobacco so a mass hub

352
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,900
we're very much about recognizing that

353
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,400
you know we're about financial inclusion

354
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,840
within the community and ensuring that

355
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,180
everybody has access to the payment

356
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,190
system as a security person as a fraud

357
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,810
prevention expert that comes at a cost

358
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,580
sometimes that the more we open up a

359
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,020
network we know that the bad guys the

360
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,210
criminals will political ways of trying

361
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,460
to exploit that so particular to that

362
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:00,980
particular case in in Belfast you know

363
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,750
here in Europe we've had it for over a

364
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,480
decade now he's we've moved away from

365
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,040
the automatic magnetic stripe technology

366
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,650
we've moved to chip technology and

367
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,300
MasterCard is a technology leader now we

368
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,520
continue to push the envelope on

369
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,500
technology to ensure that we we open up

370
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,180
the payment network in a healthy way

371
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,680
that enables consumers to get access to

372
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,900
it in a way that makes it more and more

373
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,209
difficult for criminality to get in I

374
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,740
mean for me criminals will never shy

375
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:27,080
away from trying to come after my

376
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,450
payment system it's advantageous to them

377
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,820
we've we've got a very high level of

378
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,680
security in there now and globally the

379
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,330
the in view of the chip technology we've

380
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,069
enjoyed here in Europe it's spread

381
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,530
across the role globally North America's

382
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,970
it's got that as well now so we're

383
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:43,220
starting to squeeze out a lot of the the

384
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,870
so-called organized crime that try to

385
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:47,810
exploit the weaknesses in the payment

386
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,280
system as they perceive it and so for me

387
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm very interested to see where they go

388
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,480
next they don't move away from financial

389
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,800
crime in its entirety but we're

390
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,820
certainly making it harder and what we

391
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,770
haven't they're having to find their

392
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,050
left work a lot harder to make a same

393
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,850
amount of money so criminals are often

394
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:03,290
quite lazy and so if they can't make

395
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,220
money they will move into other areas

396
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,139
and familiy

397
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,390
that's where from a mascot perspective

398
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,949
we work very closely with a lot of other

399
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,740
companies and industries around the

400
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:14,440
impact of financial crime and viste

401
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,550
particularly around sort of brands

402
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,290
damage that's taken in terms of people's

403
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,698
products being counterfeited and our

404
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,859
brand being associated be that well

405
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:22,970
that's why we're here today is to you

406
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,399
know help mine people

407
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,440
with your MasterCard we take our brand

408
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,730
integrity very strongly and safety

409
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,200
security is at the heart of a lot of

410
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:31,970
things we do now we want to eradicate

411
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,990
the problem but we also know that it

412
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:39,080
moves from one industry to another

413
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:41,900
hunter when we talk about Isis the

414
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,879
Caliphate in Iraq and Syria and okay

415
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,000
it's shrinking we gun clearly it's going

416
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,320
to shrink further physically at least

417
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,580
they do have to work with people if you

418
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,129
have to have allies don't get to sell

419
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,490
this oil I mean who are we talking about

420
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,530
nation-states here are we talking about

421
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,450
companies private corporations or

422
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,220
individuals we now have what's the

423
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,100
evidence in terms of who's helping them

424
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,440
shift the oil and make the profits yeah

425
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:08,659
I mean that the face where ISIL oil in

426
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,700
in Syria is it sold internationally it's

427
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,130
over it's simply because the volumes are

428
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,170
no longer there right so prior to the

429
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,640
conflict the area that ISIL controls now

430
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:20,000
produced about one hundred and fifteen

431
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,800
thousand barrels of oil per day during

432
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,140
the conflict of an ISIL took over

433
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,320
everywhere about forty five thousand

434
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:30,140
barrels a day now we are around 15 to

435
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,149
25th at a thousand barrels of oil so

436
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,070
there is simply not enough volume that

437
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,740
gets completely absorbed in the market

438
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,990
in in Syria by all their everyone in

439
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,480
Syria by soil because that's the

440
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,980
monopoly producer and don't forget the

441
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,170
country is currently under an

442
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,540
international embargo foil so there is

443
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:51,110
really no other oil to have then then to

444
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:53,389
buy from the one who produces it but

445
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,679
there are three issues I think here on

446
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,690
the panel that that needs to be

447
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,520
distinguished one is the isakoff

448
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,110
financing this is the big headquarter

449
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,330
right but then there is also of course

450
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,520
local financing this is what what Peter

451
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,490
was was referring to and my colleague

452
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,010
from Philip Morris refers to were sells

453
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:11,840
financing their concrete operation on

454
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,540
the spot in their home countries and

455
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,139
then there is the transfer of money and

456
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,970
there the values a store of stored value

457
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,730
cards is something that the the

458
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:25,100
Financial Action Task Force F ETF is

459
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,860
among many other things is currently

460
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,709
looking at at one way to transfer value

461
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,719
from A to B it is to buy stored value

462
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,800
cards and then simply sending them

463
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,960
either in person or by by post to

464
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,639
other party to then get the money off so

465
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,830
that these are three different issues

466
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,640
that I think get muddled up too much and

467
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:48,040
there is a clear crime terror network

468
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,620
when a connection when we talk about the

469
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:53,430
local financing there is a clear

470
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,629
connection between terrorism and

471
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,220
organized crime when we talk about the

472
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:02,980
transport of these Goods antiquities

473
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,800
other goods that they smuggling and that

474
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,590
there is not as strong a connection

475
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,419
between the criminal organization and

476
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,490
al-qaida core in Syria simply because

477
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,010
it's a war situation right so yes

478
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,180
there's a lot of crime going on

479
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:18,720
perpetrated however not by professional

480
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,640
criminal organizations

481
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,260
Peter I won't spoke to a senior member

482
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,380
of the Ulster Volunteer Force loyalist

483
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,840
terrorist group and he said that the

484
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,880
best suppliers allies they had were true

485
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,199
believers obviously so they had a true

486
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,240
believer in Canada that was supplying

487
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,890
them with weapons in the 1980s but he

488
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,210
said the hardest thing to acquire

489
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,190
weapons is to work with criminals

490
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,460
because they're easily infiltrated by

491
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,170
the state many number agents of various

492
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:49,240
company country's police forces and so

493
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:51,190
on is that a kind of a defect that even

494
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,110
ISIL will have half the deal with the

495
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,640
fact is in a way the crime Nexus works

496
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,560
both ways you can work in favor of this

497
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,490
did where criminals can be bought off

498
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:05,110
and contempo them I sex or the CIA or

499
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:07,300
whoever sure it can work both ways even

500
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,479
though in Northern Ireland the kind of

501
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:13,240
the direction was the opposite one in

502
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,640
the case of in the case of European

503
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,850
jihadists we see that they are criminals

504
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,100
fast so they already are criminals but

505
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,889
police records and then they turn into

506
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:26,530
jihadists and but in fact we've seen

507
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:29,010
from Isis is that they have in some of

508
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:32,379
their online publications they are

509
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:35,710
encouraging their supporters to act and

510
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,690
in fact even dress like criminals so

511
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,780
they are saying to people if you acquire

512
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:43,210
weapons dress up like a youth from the

513
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:46,030
ghetto so people think you're criminal

514
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:48,400
not a terrorist in fact in the case it's

515
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,049
almost a funny story if it wasn't so

516
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,919
tragic

517
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:54,609
in the case of Charlie a door and the

518
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:56,830
hostage-taking at the kosher supermarket

519
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:59,859
that happened afterwards amedy coulibaly

520
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,918
who was the perpetrator of that who had

521
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:06,820
sworn allegiance to Isis he had bought

522
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:09,340
his weapons from the guy who had sold

523
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,479
him weapons for years even when he was

524
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,418
still a criminal

525
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:16,090
and once the attacks happened that

526
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:19,450
weapons dealer called up the police and

527
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:21,488
self-reported himself he said I had no

528
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:24,009
idea I just thought this guy was an

529
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:25,749
ordinary criminal had I known that he is

530
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,119
a terrorist I would have never sought

531
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:30,729
phrasing are an ordinary decent criminal

532
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:33,789
ordinary decent criminals exactly yes

533
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:36,399
and and and and so that also makes it

534
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:38,529
problematic because the people who are

535
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:41,228
involved with these guys who sell them

536
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:43,989
fake IDs who sell them weapons don't

537
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:46,539
necessarily know that these are people

538
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:50,259
who are terrorists that's the difficult

539
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:52,720
thing about that Nexus are two speakers

540
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:55,359
from the private sector I'd like to know

541
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,029
hi you also have your own intelligence

542
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:02,879
gathering networks and you have your own

543
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:04,809
experts in what way to you work or

544
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:07,529
connect with the law-enforcement

545
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:10,710
agencies of of your country or indeed a

546
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:14,799
global bodies I mean I'm already sort of

547
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:17,619
channel the information yeah sure being

548
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,809
a working in the tobacco industry we

549
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:23,379
have a lot of knowledge about the

550
00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:25,989
distribution system we track all our

551
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:29,049
products so each of our faculty grits

552
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:31,059
has a unique identifier so it's not like

553
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:33,190
honor and on a label of the water you're

554
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,629
drinking where there is a bar code which

555
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,940
is the same on all these bottles of

556
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:40,149
water one on our pack of cigarette is a

557
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:42,580
label which is which is a single I put

558
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:44,258
that single for that single packs is a

559
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,359
unique identifier so we get we can track

560
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:49,450
at this so this is a valuable piece of

561
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:53,408
information that we have and we share it

562
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:56,049
with the law enforcement because one the

563
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:59,049
law enforcement that clearly has a much

564
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:01,010
stronger and tools to do investigations

565
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:02,900
which we as a company cannot do

566
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,550
but one advantage we have is that we

567
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,410
have a global footprint and we know that

568
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,720
the product are flowing from one country

569
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,340
to another because we can track it it's

570
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,240
valuable information for law enforcement

571
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:18,199
so we do cooperate a lot and I think the

572
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,650
the solution is always a having a

573
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,890
public-private partnership because each

574
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:27,080
act can do part of the puzzle and you

575
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,390
need a comprehensive solution in order

576
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,699
to face and to tackle the problems of

577
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,860
this this magnitude do you think there

578
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:38,150
should be an overarching global sort of

579
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:40,340
bridge between private global sort of

580
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,880
businesses and international law

581
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:45,350
enforcement I am a strong believer that

582
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,300
going forward more than today the

583
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,510
public-private partnership has to be

584
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:52,280
strengthened simply because the private

585
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,070
sector if you think in some instances

586
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,210
some international company multinational

587
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:02,000
companies have a geographical footprint

588
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:05,900
which is very big they have at the

589
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:11,210
knowledge they have the resources and in

590
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:13,400
many cases these act as non-state actors

591
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,840
a bigger than countries and I was

592
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,570
reading the Financial Times that you

593
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,520
mention it on the anarchic on the first

594
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,250
pages today so maybe many of you have

595
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:25,040
read it on the G set on the g7 which

596
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,230
says the gathering on Sicily I agreed to

597
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,909
step up efforts to fight terrorists in

598
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,850
the wake of the suicide bomber in a

599
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,950
Manchester including by pressing big

600
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,399
tech companies such as Google and

601
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:40,340
Facebook to do more to suppress Arabic

602
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,630
content so I think this is what big

603
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,520
multinational companies should be doing

604
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,930
is to be doing not only because they're

605
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,280
pressed but they should also do it

606
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,880
because it's the right thing to do and

607
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,730
there's a win-win for all all players in

608
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,350
case yeah so I see a very unique

609
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,200
position I guess in terms of MasterCard

610
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,490
as a payment technology company I don't

611
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,050
actually issue the credit cards or the

612
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,550
payment cards the bank's through doubt

613
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,560
in their respective countries just

614
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,580
remember that Foxborough yes so if you

615
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,080
want to come to me about problems in

616
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,760
your card I'd love to help you bike on

617
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,530
you need to go to your bank but that's a

618
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,790
serious point and that's where we sit in

619
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,550
a nice unique position that we aren't we

620
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,809
provide that global network so one of

621
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,129
the things that we did we

622
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:18,529
we worked very closely law enforcement

623
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:19,870
we do that the different operations that

624
00:26:18,529 --> 00:26:22,129
we support around the world there's

625
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:24,080
operation Pangaea that Interpol runs

626
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:26,120
around the illicit and trading in

627
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,879
counterfeit pharmaceuticals we work very

628
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,949
closely with the European financial

629
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,600
coalition in terms of child abuse and

630
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,009
how that's been commercialized we work

631
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,990
in a number of very specific areas to

632
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,429
deal with that and we work with law

633
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,129
enforcement globally as well and

634
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,419
interesting for me is the point to pick

635
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:44,330
up briefly on hands meant about stored

636
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:46,519
value and and this is something that we

637
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:48,049
hear quite regularly around stored value

638
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:50,840
cards and prepaid cards as people call

639
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:53,450
them and for me from a criminality point

640
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:55,668
of view they enjoy the ability to hide

641
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,279
and disguise their business money

642
00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:01,429
laundering etc cash provides a great

643
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:03,110
opportunity to do that and for me what

644
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:04,639
one of the advantages is having those

645
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,240
store value colleges that it leaves a

646
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,369
footprint

647
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,369
they cannot shy away from the footprint

648
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:12,889
so actually most I do understand that

649
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:14,629
the point being made the the war on cash

650
00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:16,158
is greater that that's such a much

651
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:18,469
greater hidden trade that we don't

652
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,940
expect to say so I'm saying from Lois

653
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,119
autumn perspective yes we work very

654
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,860
closely with a lot of agencies to do

655
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:28,549
that in a very proactive manner as well

656
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:30,678
and certainly in my industry as payments

657
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:31,820
continue to grow and and the internet

658
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,950
can change the boom we've all got

659
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:36,499
payment devices now are now on a handset

660
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,539
it's truly global so we certainly see an

661
00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:40,940
absolute rolling in supporting Loyalton

662
00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:43,519
and at government level as well in that

663
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,929
matters as well Peter I heard a phrase

664
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,340
last night which I thought was excellent

665
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:50,029
was coined by an expertise police

666
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:51,949
officer working with 2d radicalize and

667
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:54,289
prevent young people getting sucked into

668
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:57,320
the kind of jihadist networks and it was

669
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:58,850
the cyber caliphate and what he said was

670
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,869
that the cyber caliphate will replace

671
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,299
the physical one if and when the the

672
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:08,269
readouts in Syria and Iraq are

673
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:11,029
completely shrunk but the ISIS moves to

674
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:12,619
cyberspace that directed scampi and if

675
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:14,240
that's the kiyose and surely there is a

676
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:16,158
lot of money sloshing around and it's

677
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,619
war chest this is going to go on for a

678
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,570
long time and it will be more Manchester

679
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:22,129
style attacks rather than you know

680
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,678
taking over the likes of Ramadi and

681
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:26,779
Raqqa and so on mmm for sure I think

682
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,450
there's a cyber caliphate already and

683
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:29,820
there has been

684
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,059
for a number of years I think it's

685
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:36,260
important to kind of understand what's

686
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:39,000
going on if over the past five years

687
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,649
30,000 over 30,000 people from 100

688
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,880
different countries have traveled to

689
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:47,250
Syria joined jihadist groups it's

690
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,230
probably the most significant

691
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,789
mobilization of foreign fighters in the

692
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,159
Muslim world that has ever taken place

693
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:56,158
the second most significant was the

694
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,399
anti-soviet jihad in the 1980s in

695
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,100
Afghanistan and of course what happens

696
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:04,439
in Afghanistan in 1988 was that the

697
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,629
conflict ended and all these up to

698
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,820
20,000 people who had traveled there

699
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,820
including Osama bin Laden asked

700
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:14,490
themselves what now what's next and then

701
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:18,928
as a result of a conflict that happened

702
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:21,240
in 1980s in the 1990s and 2000's you had

703
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:23,639
these so-called veterans of the conflict

704
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,620
turn up in other conflicts from Bosnia

705
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:27,709
to Chechnya to Algeria to the

706
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:30,750
Philippines typically making these

707
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:33,450
conflicts worse and more religiously

708
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,960
extreme and you also had some of these

709
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:38,700
people getting together to form an

710
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,679
international terrorist network that

711
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,200
ultimately carried out the attacks on

712
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:47,309
9/11 but here's the important thing the

713
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,649
attacks on 9/11 happened 2001 that's 13

714
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:52,019
years after the end of the conflict in

715
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:54,539
Afghanistan so we're now talking about

716
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:57,179
the Manchester attacks and the conflict

717
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,309
in Syria hasn't even ended all these

718
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:02,100
fighters haven't even had to ask

719
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:04,590
themselves the question what next the

720
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,809
clock hasn't even started ticking yet so

721
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:09,539
I don't think this will end anytime soon

722
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:11,940
I think there will be consequences of

723
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,450
what's happened in Syria for many years

724
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,970
to come

725
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:16,980
and that's why it's so important that we

726
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,649
think about these consequences and start

727
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,090
preparing ourselves just before I throw

728
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:23,820
up before I throw this open to the

729
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:25,740
audience Hans ivz said a very

730
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,510
understanding Arabic Google Facebook and

731
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,159
given that we're talking about the

732
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:32,580
increasing importance of the cyber

733
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:36,179
caliphate what come the big high-tech

734
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,549
social media organizations do to be part

735
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,230
of the scariness lists read online and

736
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:41,900
then in physical

737
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:43,880
yeah so let me just put the this this

738
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,460
terminology cyber caliphate a little bit

739
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,950
in context right so there was for a

740
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,230
while thinking that if because Isis

741
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:53,150
emphasis on holding territory if you

742
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:55,610
take the territory of the organization

743
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,679
you solved your problem right that was

744
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:00,409
in the mind of a lot of the policy

745
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,299
makers and in rightfully the military

746
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:04,370
campaign was was initiated to take the

747
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:06,400
territory of to decrease the funding but

748
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,049
that's not solving the problem that

749
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,120
simply phase one right and so we're now

750
00:31:09,049 --> 00:31:13,400
entering phase two where it's no longer

751
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,678
about the physical territory the cyber

752
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,990
caliphate is simply a means by which the

753
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,640
terrior by which the network will get

754
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,100
directed right so it's not about

755
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,750
conquering space in cyberspace is

756
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,399
looking at the internet as an

757
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,290
operational tool and that's that's what

758
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,990
we are working on at the moment in new

759
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:32,899
york so obviously there's a lot of

760
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:34,850
privacy and and and and freedom of

761
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,070
speech issues involved in here but they

762
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:38,629
are also very clear operational aspects

763
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,010
if we talk about terrorist communication

764
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,840
with each other if we're talking about

765
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,830
dissemination of knowledge and

766
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,689
particularly on ID designs right and

767
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,909
quite a few attacks have now begun also

768
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,490
in europe to use IDs and if we talking

769
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:55,010
about financing calls for financing

770
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,870
transferring of money using tools within

771
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,030
the internet and that's where i think

772
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:01,580
there is a great opportunity for a

773
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,840
stronger public-private partnership I'm

774
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,639
not saying it's it's not happening

775
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,340
already you have already here in New

776
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,190
York the in Europe the internet referral

777
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:13,159
unit at Acura pole that works with tech

778
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:16,370
companies on issues of terrorists

779
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:18,169
contents on the on the website but more

780
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:20,389
can be done right more can be done on

781
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:22,610
identifying who is using your products

782
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,559
by these companies and identifying what

783
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:27,049
are the products precisely used for and

784
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,850
what are according to their own terms

785
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:30,620
and services legitimate and not

786
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:32,480
legitimate users Peter just wanted a yes

787
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,729
just a couple more things because I

788
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,760
think that's really important that's a

789
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:41,840
really important area the first is the

790
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:44,929
mistake that was made in 2011 should not

791
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,870
be repeated in 2011 we mistook a

792
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:50,059
movement for an organization al Qaeda

793
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:52,229
central was defeated and everyone in

794
00:32:50,059 --> 00:32:54,809
Washington DC concluded the

795
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:57,390
is over but in fact of course we're

796
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:59,668
dealing with a movement the jihadist

797
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:02,429
Salafist movement I have no doubt that

798
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:05,809
in five years time there will still be a

799
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:08,309
movement I do not know what particular

800
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:10,950
organization will lead that movement I

801
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:13,350
have no idea I personally I rather doubt

802
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,299
that in five years time the Islamic

803
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,840
state will still be as important as it

804
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,700
is now

805
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,370
but there will still be a movement and

806
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,410
they will perhaps transform into a

807
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,719
different organization and one of the

808
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:26,490
most important debates and most exciting

809
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,710
and interesting debates that is

810
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:32,040
currently starting within the jihadist

811
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:35,340
movement that is not over is precisely

812
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:38,010
how supporters will respond to the

813
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:40,230
decline of the Caliphate I mean yes I

814
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:43,919
absolutely agree it's not the end of the

815
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,600
story but in 2014 the leader of Islamic

816
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,240
state declared essentially a

817
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,730
thousand-year Reich the territorial

818
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,400
strategy was in many ways the unique

819
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:55,650
selling point of Islamic state two years

820
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,929
later that Caliphate not state is

821
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,820
crumbling and of course there are

822
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:01,980
supporters of Islamic state who are now

823
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,110
asking questions and while saying how

824
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,510
can it be that something that was

825
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:09,060
declared to be remaining and expanding

826
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,560
forever is now falling apart and how

827
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,659
will we respond to it what does that

828
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,359
mean for the legitimacy of the entire

829
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:17,940
project well given that we're probably

830
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,409
going to expect a mutating neo Islamic

831
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,899
state or something else it's going to

832
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,850
need to finance itself so with that in

833
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:25,560
mind let's throw open to the audience

834
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,710
and for any thoughts on the nexus

835
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,480
between crime and terrorism in the 21st

836
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,750
century so people had this gentleman

837
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,750
here

838
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:46,618
Thank You wonderful presentation I I'm

839
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:50,639
surprised that you're using the leaf of

840
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:53,520
Halawa so easily which is an Islamic

841
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,260
term and has a positive meaning so the

842
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,869
way you're talking it is unfortunately I

843
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,609
hear it that you talk directly to

844
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:01,680
al-qaeda to ESS to all the extreme

845
00:34:59,609 --> 00:35:05,450
groups who are not even representing one

846
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,919
or two person of the Islamic world so

847
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,899
excuse me I apologize for that one that

848
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,150
this communication is in fact giving

849
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,859
them the grounds to recruit more so it

850
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,839
means you're accepting them as

851
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:18,270
representative the Islamic world which

852
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,980
is not your intention definitely and we

853
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,470
should in fact be more careful being in

854
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,990
a West and in fact we need to find out

855
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:27,660
the success story of our own society

856
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,430
here Islam Muslim community in each of

857
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,319
these respected nations they are the

858
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,180
success story they know better in fact

859
00:35:31,319 --> 00:35:35,609
about the Islamic work to come and be

860
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,828
exposed on your front page of the media

861
00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:39,720
not all the time explosion or not or not

862
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:41,880
all the time coding in fact the extreme

863
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,799
groups don't you think that we are

864
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,390
failing that context we are not doing

865
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:47,400
much we are not bringing the success

866
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:49,828
story of our own nations here the

867
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,559
Muslims are not an Islamic world we have

868
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:54,660
Muslims in each of single countries why

869
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,970
do you address Muslim like in only

870
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,490
melodies Muslims on each country are

871
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:01,529
your success stories your main partners

872
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,720
most of the panel's I don't see any

873
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,309
Muslims who are really speaking from the

874
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,109
Islamic point of view or being a Muslim

875
00:36:05,309 --> 00:36:08,940
scholar only somebody who did the

876
00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:10,319
dissertation on Islam or some kind of

877
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,990
things they come and speak about this

878
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:14,880
fate I think we are losing more than the

879
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,890
core we are not having the right people

880
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,630
not addressing that one and more giving

881
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:21,118
the ground for the extremists to recruit

882
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:22,799
more thank you and not finding out in

883
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,890
fact the elephant in the room who which

884
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:28,140
countries are in fact feeding sponsoring

885
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:30,420
that one instead of exposing them

886
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,790
because of the great man and woman in

887
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,950
your uniforms they die because of this

888
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,930
conflict we are even making deals of

889
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:39,899
weaponry with them who are not even

890
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:41,660
having an army or soldiers thank you

891
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:44,310
handsomely

892
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,319
responded on no I mean I agree with the

893
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:48,750
fact that you need to engage the Muslim

894
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,400
communities here in Europe stronger and

895
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,430
highlight the positive aspects and that

896
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,280
there is a danger to see that all

897
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:58,649
terrorists are Muslims and I I hope I

898
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,330
wasn't misunderstood when I was talking

899
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,760
about the financing aspects I wasn't

900
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:06,930
trying to legitimize a State Building

901
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,430
project of the Islamic group here and

902
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,859
the Security Council has been very

903
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,930
careful in its wording actually as far

904
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,300
as words like Caliphate or jihad is

905
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:19,350
concerned and you didn't hear me use the

906
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,170
word yeah so it is it is absolutely a

907
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:25,170
word of terminology and obviously the

908
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,030
work on the root causes is an important

909
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:31,200
thing however if you look at the

910
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:33,960
European jihadist not sure Peter can't

911
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,649
talk to this in more detail it's really

912
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,570
hard to find a profile right so it's not

913
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:42,480
the disenfranchised only or the

914
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:45,300
unemployed only or the uneducated only

915
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,760
so it's not the ones who are in any way

916
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,920
objectively speaking marginalized from

917
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,200
society that joined but it's also your

918
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,330
university graduate your engineer your

919
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:57,149
doctors or joining so that is obviously

920
00:37:54,330 --> 00:38:01,290
a problem of identity here right so can

921
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:04,080
can you be a German and Muslim and that

922
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:06,900
is a discussion that the society needs

923
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,940
to have what does it mean to be a Muslim

924
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,310
in Germany and that should be done

925
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,800
I take Germany as an example because I

926
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,330
come from there but that's a

927
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,880
conversation that each society has to

928
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:21,000
have with their Muslim community of what

929
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,500
it means to be European and Muslim at

930
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,310
the same time and there are many success

931
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,500
stories but this this phenomenon showed

932
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:32,250
that there is really at least in a small

933
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:34,920
part of society a crisis of identity and

934
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,960
therefore clear-cut extremely radical

935
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,790
ideas that says in the world falls

936
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,280
neatly into good and bad and you know

937
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,750
here are clear ways of what good is and

938
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,210
everything else by definition is

939
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:48,660
therefore bad it may be an attractive

940
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:50,880
offer kidding I agree with most of your

941
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,890
points I just want to say something

942
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,030
about the terminology because that's

943
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:59,069
something that I think we always

944
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:01,290
kind of make too complicated and having

945
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,210
been in these debates for 20 years

946
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,130
there's always someone who stands up and

947
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,310
says all the true meaning of jihad and

948
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:09,840
why do you talk about Islam and of

949
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,420
course I'm not speaking to an audience

950
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,900
was likely to be radicalized we are

951
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,270
happy

952
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,520
I hope so at least we're having I'm

953
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:20,580
speaking to an expert audience and I do

954
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,580
not expect any any of you to to easily

955
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:26,130
fall prey to the terminology that is

956
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,560
being used when we talk about the IRA

957
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:31,050
the Irish Republican Army were not by

958
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,880
using that term we're not implying that

959
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:35,160
they are the true inheritors of the

960
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,200
Irish Republican tradition when during

961
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,569
the Cold War we were talking about East

962
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,730
Germany by its official name the German

963
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,560
Democratic Republic I don't think there

964
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:45,480
were many who believed that that there

965
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:47,580
was anything democratic about East

966
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,970
Germany that's how these entities call

967
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,740
themselves and I think it's okay to call

968
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,910
themselves by what they call themselves

969
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:57,209
and that does not mean that I buy into

970
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:00,120
it

971
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,800
I absolutely don't but in the case of

972
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:04,920
Islamic state there is an important

973
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,780
thing which is that this group calls

974
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:11,370
itself Islamic state we don't like that

975
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,860
but I think we're missing an important

976
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:16,710
aspect of that organization if we just

977
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:19,560
refer to it as a terrorist group because

978
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,410
that group sees itself very much as a

979
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,990
state it acts as a state it has a

980
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:28,859
bureaucracy very complicated burocracy

981
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:31,560
it has an army or what it sees as an

982
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:34,020
army when last year those 20,000

983
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,660
documents of Islamic state were captured

984
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,270
journalists were asking me how can it be

985
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:42,180
that a terrorist organization is keeping

986
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:44,250
records on its members and my answer was

987
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,140
it's precisely because that group

988
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,570
doesn't see itself as a terrorist

989
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,400
organization it sees itself as a state

990
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:53,550
and it looks at these recruits as

991
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,740
members of its army so I think the state

992
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:58,380
aspect whether we like it or not is

993
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,759
actually a very important characteristic

994
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,970
of the group that we're dealing with

995
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,040
with because they see themselves as has

996
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:07,459
anyone else knowledge any thoughts about

997
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,009
the nexus with crime I mean

998
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:12,800
and the fact is in many ways that anyone

999
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:15,140
I suppose who's buying it as a consumer

1000
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,770
in the illicit market whatever it is

1001
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,660
could be inadvertently guilty of funding

1002
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,859
terrorism the 21st century just a

1003
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:28,160
thought to throw out to the audience

1004
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:31,040
sir uh thank you for the interesting

1005
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,129
remarks so far terrorist groups have

1006
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,440
been fairly entrepreneurial about

1007
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,190
adopting high-tech solutions to their

1008
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,740
communications needs we talked about

1009
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:44,630
stored value cards but I have to believe

1010
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:48,290
that with everything happening in fin

1011
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:49,670
tech and money laundering by criminal

1012
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,710
groups in the high-tech world I'm

1013
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:56,329
surprised that you haven't talked about

1014
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:58,940
the potential for their cybercrime Nexus

1015
00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:02,750
and jihad coming together in the money

1016
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:04,970
laundering and criminality space if

1017
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,410
anybody has any remarks on that I was

1018
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,200
fascinated to learn to each pack of

1019
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:12,379
cigarettes has its own identifier code

1020
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,770
but that that opens up all sorts of

1021
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:18,559
possibilities for well many actors

1022
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:21,430
anyway maybe gif I know they say she

1023
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:24,619
could feed that question in particular

1024
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:27,790
so I have to take the first part in

1025
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:30,349
terms of I think for me it's interesting

1026
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,730
so I'm a fraud prevention expert that's

1027
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:33,290
how I consider myself today

1028
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:34,579
and for me I'm looking at in a very

1029
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,829
simple way someone's trying to break

1030
00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:38,480
into my system to somehow take value out

1031
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:41,420
of that and three it's as simple as that

1032
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,359
in the last five six years the word

1033
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:46,520
cyber has grown to mean so many things

1034
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:49,160
to so many people I think we're losing

1035
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,829
sight of some of the the actors that are

1036
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,589
involved in cyber crime so in the car

1037
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:56,420
payment business I hear now a lot of

1038
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:58,430
so-called cyber criminals are attacking

1039
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,680
the payment system and here in Europe we

1040
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:01,759
suffered a huge ransomware attack and in

1041
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,390
the last couple of weeks certainly I

1042
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,640
felt that close to home having being in

1043
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:09,859
hospital the day it happened and and so

1044
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,569
the impact of cyber is so broad and

1045
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:14,598
widening I think people don't don't

1046
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:17,320
truly understand what what it means but

1047
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:19,580
in terms of do I see

1048
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,500
terrorist groups or so-called terrorist

1049
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,930
groups looking at the payment system as

1050
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:27,350
a means of moving money around and and

1051
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:30,890
using that to fund their activities and

1052
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:32,000
I don't recognize that in the waiver we

1053
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,490
talked about some of the acts that we're

1054
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,780
talking about here I agree as you

1055
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:39,410
mentioned the case in Belfast

1056
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:43,400
I see isolated cases of that but it's

1057
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:45,799
not systemic but what I do see is quite

1058
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,390
often cash being used to move moved

1059
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,030
around by criminals to move value

1060
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,710
between different groups so the stored

1061
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:53,630
value one for me again is is interesting

1062
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,950
if I look at the legislation that that's

1063
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:58,730
moving through in certain countries in

1064
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,680
Europe my email for is there the value

1065
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,020
in some of these stored cards is so

1066
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,810
small and so minimal it doesn't really

1067
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,800
plane advantage to criminals and again

1068
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:09,140
it comes back to in a moment you

1069
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,880
electron if either the value actually I

1070
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,500
can trace it I can see where it goes and

1071
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,050
I can tell you where it went in and

1072
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,040
where it came out so actually from a

1073
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,020
criminal and from a terrorist

1074
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,900
perspective the the payment systems

1075
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,090
aren't useful for them to do that I can

1076
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:24,860
move money round I won't disagree with

1077
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,570
that comment but it leaves an audit in

1078
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,430
the trailer and if these guys want to

1079
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:30,770
operate in the shadows and not get cold

1080
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,060
then then they don't want to do that and

1081
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,460
the last comment I will make just fill

1082
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,700
out the internet as well we're starting

1083
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,710
to see a lot of the mainstream

1084
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:42,379
criminality that the hackers who trading

1085
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:43,670
data and they're getting pushed now into

1086
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,500
in the so called dark web and they're

1087
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:47,780
getting pushed into the corners which

1088
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,340
from a from a mainstream payment system

1089
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,990
that that's good for me because it means

1090
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,870
a lot of my customers don't fall victim

1091
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,700
to scams on the internet because they

1092
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:58,310
don't trust it and I know with my brand

1093
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,710
being misused to supposedly legitimize a

1094
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:03,020
corrupt business offering or a website

1095
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,400
whatever it means now that people to

1096
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,810
become less and less prone to becoming

1097
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,730
victim of that and a lot of still are

1098
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:09,200
but if we're making the job more

1099
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:11,630
difficult within our industry for all

1100
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,129
hallows it and pants again and then

1101
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:16,130
we'll another person the audience of go

1102
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:18,190
ahead yeah I think that you have a point

1103
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:21,010
cyber and

1104
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:23,500
as much I understand the cyber tax is a

1105
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,520
world which we only started to discover

1106
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:28,960
so your point is very much valid

1107
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,160
tracking every pack of cigarettes means

1108
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,130
that we're going to have a huge amount

1109
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,230
of data which can be hacked so

1110
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:37,540
definitely by the Pointer I'll just add

1111
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:39,790
two things to it first

1112
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:42,400
what you also mention about the value of

1113
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:45,730
each pack is quite small so there's a

1114
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,380
disturb which is say is a natural

1115
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:51,130
defense against cyber attacks which we

1116
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:53,770
haven't seen so far on a data basis but

1117
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,720
on the other hand the suffice it been

1118
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:58,690
the industry has voluntarily tracked

1119
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:04,109
their products and as of 2019 there's a

1120
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:07,150
European directive on tobacco which will

1121
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,830
regulate that all tobacco security in

1122
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,440
Europe will have to have a unique

1123
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:14,200
identifier in each single pack so in two

1124
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,700
years time in May 2009 T when this

1125
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,830
director goes into force then the

1126
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,810
problem could really Bologna be much

1127
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:23,049
bigger because it's going to be for all

1128
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:25,600
Europe all tobacco products also valid

1129
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:28,240
point I mean two things on the on the

1130
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,980
high-tech issue so obviously there was a

1131
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,069
great concern around crypto currencies

1132
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:36,820
right Bitcoin in others for cases

1133
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:39,550
internationally so far right so it's not

1134
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,290
yet it's not yet there simply our

1135
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,510
interpretation of what's going on is

1136
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:46,870
they just don't need it yet right it's

1137
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:50,200
still much easier much better much

1138
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:52,120
secure to move money by the wire money

1139
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,069
money service providers of all adults

1140
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,839
who are unregulated in most countries

1141
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:58,390
and then so there is really no clear

1142
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,420
overview of how much cash flows in and

1143
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:03,220
out from these on a global scale and by

1144
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,260
by money carriers all right so as long

1145
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:08,169
as you keep underneath the international

1146
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:10,630
barrier of ten thousand equivalent in

1147
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,460
your local currency of ten thousand US

1148
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,020
dollars by entering a country you don't

1149
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,210
even have to declare that you bring the

1150
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,460
money with you so moving money in small

1151
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:20,290
amount and don't forget this is not a

1152
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:24,850
commercial enterprise this is not about

1153
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:26,560
a time is money time is in unlimited

1154
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,569
supplies so if you need to move a

1155
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,520
million dollars why are hundred carriers

1156
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:32,320
and that takes you four months that's

1157
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,420
the way you do it

1158
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,360
because that's simply the safest way to

1159
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:39,280
get your cash across on the on the

1160
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,440
stored value cards before we completely

1161
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,170
leave this out and yes you can see where

1162
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:48,180
their board potentially by whom if they

1163
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:53,350
don't pay in cash and yes you can see by

1164
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:56,350
where they get out if they don't if they

1165
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,270
again try to use electronic means but

1166
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,830
you don't know who is behind that right

1167
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,780
so it's a transfer mechanism I'm not

1168
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,390
saying is a big problem I'm just saying

1169
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:08,050
this is one issue which is fairly simple

1170
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:09,970
because you don't have to devolve your

1171
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:13,110
address details if you buy a stored

1172
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:16,419
value card unadjusted that last night

1173
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:18,640
for 400 euros I had not to present any

1174
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,280
identity so yes of course in that job a

1175
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,710
stored value card for 50 years worth bob

1176
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,360
was bought but by whom no one knows I

1177
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:29,890
paid in cash done right so so there is a

1178
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:32,860
it's a simple mechanism that is there

1179
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:35,770
that that we provide as a society as an

1180
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:38,650
economy that is easy to be misused to

1181
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:40,509
transport small amounts I'm mind you but

1182
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:43,000
when we talked about the financing of

1183
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:45,700
not of ISIL but of individual attacks

1184
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,410
small amounts is what counts you don't

1185
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,109
need a million dollars for Manchester

1186
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,549
you need if I don't remember correctly

1187
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,590
one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars

1188
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,710
all in including flights and training

1189
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:58,630
for 911 Paris was much cheaper and I'm

1190
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,660
quite sure that Manchester will come in

1191
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:04,330
a way beyond that that marks so a

1192
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,980
hundred dollars does get you along a

1193
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,630
long way in that respect this gentleman

1194
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,800
here in the second rope would like to be

1195
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,870
scared and might be from others

1196
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,400
that's an honor and I'm gonna like you

1197
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:16,109
can keep your questions pretty succinct

1198
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,940
thank you what aspects of fighting

1199
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:21,360
financing of ISIL are particular to the

1200
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:24,430
group compared to financing other

1201
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:27,340
fighting groups you know the situation

1202
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:29,109
and the triple front here in Paraguay

1203
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,690
Brazil is something that's very often

1204
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,280
talked about fund some other militant

1205
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:37,150
groups so what are the things that we

1206
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,830
can learn from fighting the financing of

1207
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,750
other groups applied to dodge and the

1208
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:42,680
things that are particular to - thank

1209
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:46,039
you

1210
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,578
generally speaking there are four means

1211
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:52,660
four types of means by which groups like

1212
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:55,609
that fund themselves the first is

1213
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:58,160
support is getting support from

1214
00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:01,730
supporters whether it is state funding

1215
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:04,670
or voluntary contributions by people

1216
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:08,119
they came to represent the second is

1217
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:10,759
income that results from participating

1218
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:13,039
in illicit economies that's where we see

1219
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:15,680
a lot of smuggling for example third

1220
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:17,690
aspect is legitimate income that's what

1221
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,940
makes it different from money-laundering

1222
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:21,980
for example because when you're dealing

1223
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,779
with criminal money you're trying to

1224
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:26,269
launder it into legitimate money

1225
00:50:23,779 --> 00:50:28,309
terrorist fund terrorist funding can't

1226
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:30,618
be legitimate to begin with it becomes

1227
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:32,749
dirty by the purpose for which it is

1228
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:35,990
used so no one questions for example

1229
00:50:32,749 --> 00:50:38,808
that Osama bin Laden was wealthy he was

1230
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:41,089
wealthy and his his his his money was

1231
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,630
legitimate he inherited it from his

1232
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:44,630
father

1233
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:46,849
it became dirty by the way he used it

1234
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,349
not how he acquired it and of course

1235
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:51,200
we've seen that in Northern Ireland in

1236
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:54,130
in a number of cases and the fourth

1237
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:57,288
method of income is what we've seen

1238
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:59,450
particularly in case of Islamic state

1239
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:02,180
which is the exploitation of territory

1240
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:04,339
that's what happens when terrorist

1241
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,980
groups transform into insurgencies whole

1242
00:51:04,339 --> 00:51:09,470
territory can start taxing there people

1243
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:12,710
can start generating income from natural

1244
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:15,049
resources etc etc etc and the problem

1245
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:18,230
then becomes when these groups hold

1246
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:20,180
territory that the entire structure of

1247
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:24,259
international counter-terrorist finance

1248
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:28,640
stops to work you know because we know

1249
00:51:24,259 --> 00:51:32,720
that you know ISIL had a budget of 1.7

1250
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,368
billion perhaps in in 2015 but of course

1251
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,230
most of that money was completely

1252
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:38,210
disconnected from the international

1253
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,880
financial system that's why I'm saying

1254
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:42,950
we have to really rethink how we counter

1255
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:46,039
terrorist financing when we have groups

1256
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:48,049
that hold territory which by and large

1257
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,210
do not participate in the international

1258
00:51:48,049 --> 00:51:53,029
financial system and then we have the

1259
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:54,970
local manifestations of these groups who

1260
00:51:53,029 --> 00:51:57,250
are essentially self-funding

1261
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:59,439
and who carry out terrorist attacks that

1262
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:01,450
basically cost nothing that cost less

1263
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,370
than a thousand dollars the most

1264
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:06,609
expensive terrorist act over the past

1265
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:08,859
two years was the truck attack and knees

1266
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:11,230
because that truck cost three hundred

1267
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:13,840
dollars to rent all the other attacks

1268
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:15,850
with knives with cars were cheaper than

1269
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:18,250
that so you have to ask yourself the

1270
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:20,319
question what is the utility of our

1271
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:22,000
current ways of tackling countering

1272
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,280
terrorist finance when we're dealing

1273
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,560
with a modus operandi that doesn't

1274
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,980
involve the moving of a lot of money if

1275
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:33,130
I had if I was a policymaker I would say

1276
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:35,590
instead of putting more layers on it the

1277
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:39,450
international banking system let's fight

1278
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:41,520
petty crime knowing that a lot of these

1279
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:44,230
jihadists have criminal backgrounds

1280
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,900
benefit from drug-dealing benefit from

1281
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:49,600
criminal networks that seems to be a

1282
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,640
more efficient way of targeting

1283
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,220
terrorist finance than trying to look

1284
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,140
for suspicious transactions that only

1285
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:58,149
become suspicious if you know that that

1286
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,520
person is is a suspect in the first

1287
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:01,780
place okay two more people punch these

1288
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,030
two questions together if you wouldn't

1289
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,740
mind we'll chop them some simple kind of

1290
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:06,490
the last question is very close to what

1291
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:08,459
I wanted to ask

1292
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:10,990
I've heard I want to hear other schemes

1293
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,420
for example I heard using use

1294
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:15,640
automobiles the stored value there and

1295
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:17,560
transfer that across borders but also

1296
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,089
the the other transfers through

1297
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,500
charitable organizations direct

1298
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:23,100
transfers from other people who want to

1299
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:25,630
do it you know what percent of that is

1300
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:27,190
financing terrorism and how effective

1301
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:29,980
are we in terms of shutting some of

1302
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:34,050
those other types of finance mechanisms

1303
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,050
down on this gentleman here that

1304
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,250
representing ourselves College actually

1305
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,259
I'm surprised that we are talking about

1306
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:45,660
organized crime without mentioning it

1307
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:48,520
Italy and I come from Naples so like I

1308
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:50,859
have like direct experience of certain

1309
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,550
things like if we look at the history of

1310
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,690
the three major Italian mafias like

1311
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,810
Kimura and rangita in mafia they

1312
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:01,990
actually grow in connection with the

1313
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:04,779
state I mean it's not like a secret that

1314
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:05,560
Kabul used Kimura to guarantee Garibaldi

1315
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,650
when he was coming

1316
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,360
so now and also I mean now we are

1317
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:12,250
talking about the Islamic state but if

1318
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:16,000
we look at order like jihadi

1319
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:18,220
organization I think a QAM we have seen

1320
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,800
in the operational shift that Algerian

1321
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:23,410
terrorism as known in the past 10 years

1322
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,500
that they turn from like pure jihadist

1323
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:28,270
organization to a sort of hybrid

1324
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:31,030
organization and we either even had

1325
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:32,920
smugglers like Abuja head who turned to

1326
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:36,130
be major leaders without I mean

1327
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:39,900
measuring Belmokhtar of course in those

1328
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:43,000
like do you think there are some state

1329
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:46,330
responsibilities in this rise in the

1330
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,480
sense that certain states of the region

1331
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:52,180
in North Africa or in the Middle East

1332
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:56,050
they didn't do as much as they could to

1333
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:58,540
stop these emergence because of lack of

1334
00:54:56,050 --> 00:55:01,630
capacities but also because the interest

1335
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:04,000
of some people in like making money out

1336
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:07,870
of these projects and the second point

1337
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,810
is I mean in Italy sometimes we're

1338
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:12,549
talking about like ways to stop this

1339
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:15,070
phenomena like do you think there are

1340
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:18,460
experiences around Europe and the word

1341
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:22,240
that can be used as an example Naples in

1342
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:24,700
the 90s was flooded with sea contraband

1343
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:28,060
like cigarettes and now this phenomenon

1344
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:30,339
doesn't exist anymore in any case has

1345
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:32,440
been reduced Italy from this point of

1346
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:35,530
view between like the 90s and the new

1347
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,590
century made the number of changes that

1348
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:40,960
allow to like reduce significantly D

1349
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:43,060
this type of traffic's and the third

1350
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,930
point is if they are making money out of

1351
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:47,200
drug smuggling

1352
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:50,470
should we liberalize like drugs just to

1353
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,950
recap completely this kind I know this

1354
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:54,850
is like a bit of a provocation

1355
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:56,740
electrification let's go oh that's a

1356
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:58,240
very provocative point let me start at

1357
00:55:56,740 --> 00:56:01,419
one of the legalization of drugs will

1358
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,160
undermine global crime at criminality

1359
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:05,710
and funding terrorism there you go

1360
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:07,330
look I mean if you look at Afghanistan

1361
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:10,930
you do see a very close connection

1362
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:13,840
between the drug production areas and

1363
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:16,450
areas with the Taliban hold control

1364
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:19,099
right so there it really is it's really

1365
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:22,269
hard to distinguish word track Network

1366
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:25,519
ends in the Taliban start Taliban got

1367
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:27,439
financed initially by three of the major

1368
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,209
drug dealers in Afghanistan in the setup

1369
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,309
of the movement so this has been a very

1370
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:33,109
close marriage on that form but how it

1371
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:35,299
was not the case that when near to try

1372
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:38,180
to clamp down on the poppy production

1373
00:56:35,299 --> 00:56:40,069
that the farmers started to support in

1374
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:41,538
Taliban again because they promised

1375
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:42,920
they'd get continued for just I'm not

1376
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:45,109
because the Taliban are very much this

1377
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,420
is not about NATO climbing down this is

1378
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:49,460
the Taliban having are involved in all

1379
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:50,809
stages of the production so one thing

1380
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,359
that that needs to be understood is that

1381
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:55,640
you cannot generate seeds out of your

1382
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:57,859
harvest so you need an external seeds

1383
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,078
provider for your poppy harvest that was

1384
00:56:57,859 --> 00:57:01,848
the Taliban then of course you need

1385
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:04,099
money to live on until the harvest so

1386
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:07,849
the Taliban afforded credit schemes to

1387
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:10,430
the farmers which magically always were

1388
00:57:07,849 --> 00:57:12,289
less than the were more than the

1389
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:14,169
expected yield of the field and the

1390
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:17,059
profit that the farmer could could

1391
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:19,640
generate so the farmer was in internal

1392
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:22,729
debt to the Taliban and and therefore

1393
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,469
you know you see Taliban forces wavering

1394
00:57:22,729 --> 00:57:25,879
according to the harvest times to

1395
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:27,739
harvest in Afghanistan and when there's

1396
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,469
harvest time there is a significant drop

1397
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:32,210
in violence every single year because

1398
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:34,069
the farmers are now on the fields and no

1399
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:37,160
longer with the Taliban because they are

1400
00:57:34,069 --> 00:57:37,549
in a in a dependant relationships to the

1401
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,828
Taliban

1402
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:42,019
so it wasn't night or climbing down it

1403
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:44,660
was the Taliban having a grip on that

1404
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:46,189
industry which incidentally is not a

1405
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,319
traditional industry in Afghanistan

1406
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:49,369
it started funnily enough in the fight

1407
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,319
against the Soviet Union

1408
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:53,119
where in which I hadn't discovered that

1409
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:55,999
heroine production is a neat way to

1410
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,069
finance your activities so this is a

1411
00:57:55,999 --> 00:58:00,049
long long-standing problem but not as

1412
00:57:58,069 --> 00:58:02,479
long as people assume Afghanistan did

1413
00:58:00,049 --> 00:58:05,329
not used to be the main product producer

1414
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:07,249
of heroin in the world so that's where

1415
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:11,059
you see very close connection and the

1416
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:13,279
rest is where you see a group there's

1417
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:15,109
groups infusing themselves in the flow

1418
00:58:13,279 --> 00:58:17,319
of illicit goods right so you mentioned

1419
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:19,940
multiple Mokpo incidentally and this is

1420
00:58:17,319 --> 00:58:21,229
important I know I'm sure the colleague

1421
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,239
from Philip Morris knows that is also

1422
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:24,799
known as mr. Marlboro because he was

1423
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:26,569
very much involved in the Marlboro

1424
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:28,609
smuggling activities but not in the

1425
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:31,130
producing of Marlboros but in making

1426
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:32,450
sure Marlboros went from A to B so

1427
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,849
that's where we see on

1428
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:37,160
drug side the infusion of of Tears

1429
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:39,740
because drugs flow and illicit

1430
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:42,649
activities flow were governs this week

1431
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:45,379
and where governance this week terrorism

1432
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:47,329
is very likely to happen right another

1433
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:50,000
issue is by one of the members of the

1434
00:58:47,329 --> 00:58:52,160
audience was the abuse of charity by

1435
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,420
given terrorism on the cheap all your

1436
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,700
thoughts on that I mean you know the guy

1437
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,780
standing I said somewhere robbing a ten

1438
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,348
and you don't know where the money's

1439
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:03,290
going to how important cannot be and

1440
00:58:59,349 --> 00:59:04,880
what can be done to monitoring I mean

1441
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:08,480
this is where we see the risk at the

1442
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:11,030
moment um we did not see ISIL trying to

1443
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,829
addition a lot of external funding for

1444
00:59:11,030 --> 00:59:15,140
the last few years the argument was

1445
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:17,230
always the organization wants not to be

1446
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,420
dependent on external funders ie

1447
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:22,880
generous donors who usually give money

1448
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:25,640
with a condition attached to it

1449
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,349
however ask now that and then ISIL has

1450
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,049
proven the concept this is an answer to

1451
00:59:27,349 --> 00:59:31,599
the the other gentleman's question has

1452
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:33,980
proven a few concepts here right so

1453
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:36,040
exploiting oilfields good way to make

1454
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,810
money the special conflict zones

1455
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:40,190
smuggling antiquities perfect way to

1456
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:42,020
make money and they're still acting

1457
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:44,030
although they no longer looting as much

1458
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,190
as they used before as service provider

1459
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:48,829
for everyone else who lutes antiquities

1460
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:51,410
in Syria in Iraq so you can not only

1461
00:59:48,829 --> 00:59:53,390
need to hold territory to make money out

1462
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:56,270
of antiquities so it proved a few very

1463
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:58,460
innovative concepts now as this gets

1464
00:59:56,270 --> 01:00:01,630
more difficult as the territory shrinks

1465
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:05,510
and there is of course this danger that

1466
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:09,230
you have again a trying to procure funds

1467
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:10,910
by asking donors in particular misusing

1468
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:12,950
charity organizations so as we've seen

1469
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:16,160
in Afghanistan with biopharm al haramein

1470
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:17,990
where entire NGOs were set up for the

1471
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,629
purpose of funding al-qaeda in

1472
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:23,509
Afghanistan the risk that this is going

1473
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:25,069
to happen again and here is where the

1474
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:27,589
current situation is a tricky one

1475
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:29,869
because obviously you want funds in

1476
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:32,000
large amounts flow into areas like

1477
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:34,839
Ramadi Fallujah and other areas then

1478
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,089
hopefully soon Mosul in Iraq to rebuild

1479
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:40,640
however as the as these are high risk

1480
01:00:38,089 --> 01:00:42,940
areas you will not be able to as a

1481
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,710
charity organization get a bank account

1482
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:48,770
which means there is absolutely

1483
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:51,530
no view of the flows that go into that

1484
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:53,300
territory that in combination with ISIL

1485
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:54,890
potentially looking again to misuse

1486
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,690
money flows from charitable

1487
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:58,368
organizations is a really dangerous

1488
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,170
situation because if you have 100

1489
01:00:58,369 --> 01:01:03,740
million dollars flowing in and you have

1490
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:06,170
no idea who how much when and where it's

1491
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,790
received then you do have a big problem

1492
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:10,280
on the other hand on the commercial

1493
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:12,529
banking side where the compliance

1494
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,020
officers decide to de-risk it's a

1495
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:17,359
situation where no government so far can

1496
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:19,369
give them straight guidelines of what

1497
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:22,040
are the compliance criterias if you have

1498
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:25,369
a multi nation funded a project and you

1499
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,200
have as many compliance requirements at

1500
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:28,609
different compliance requirements as you

1501
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,069
have nation-states funding the project

1502
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:33,020
so the compliance manager in the bank

1503
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,970
has no way to gauge its risk for its

1504
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:37,009
organization so the only logical

1505
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:39,740
conclusion is to completely deal with

1506
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:41,839
any any charity or organization so

1507
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,609
that's a big problem showing each one

1508
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:46,509
nervous yeah I just want to do maybe

1509
01:01:43,609 --> 01:01:50,810
respond to my Apple Italian compatriot

1510
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:53,180
about all the questions asked

1511
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:57,920
one is what have we learned from Italy

1512
01:01:53,180 --> 01:02:00,710
in the last 3040 years on the vigil

1513
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:03,920
contain mafia and the Camorra I think

1514
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:06,080
one is that a lot of was fascinated many

1515
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,420
years ago was to seize the properties of

1516
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:11,390
the camorrista the mafiosi and I think

1517
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:13,010
that one actually worked there was an

1518
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:16,819
adduct or one or one of the big bosses

1519
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:20,390
of the remember his name anymore but he

1520
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:22,099
said that put me in prison take away my

1521
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:24,770
freedom but don't take away my

1522
01:02:22,099 --> 01:02:26,570
properties I mean when it talks that the

1523
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:29,170
properties is ready you touch the NDA so

1524
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:29,170
this this law

1525
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:36,250
you could know better I forget to him

1526
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:41,800
but anyway ft that was one thing and the

1527
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:43,750
other thing is you say is the connection

1528
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,480
between these organization and the

1529
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:48,520
politics I think the answer is obviously

1530
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,600
yes and I think in the tobacco industry

1531
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,940
we see that as well

1532
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,670
I mentioned beforehand and it's nothing

1533
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:57,130
new the the president of Paraguay is

1534
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:59,320
been known to produce cigarettes in his

1535
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:03,460
country and actually there was a

1536
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:04,810
Congress hearing in the Congress the

1537
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:09,640
United States a couple of weeks ago

1538
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:12,640
where mr. Otto legi said exactly that

1539
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:14,290
that the president of Paraguay the

1540
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,900
biggest producer of cigarettes he

1541
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:20,050
produces 60 billion cigarettes where the

1542
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:22,330
market absorbs three billion so 60

1543
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:24,190
billion produced three billion consumed

1544
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:26,799
in this country what with the other

1545
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:28,300
fifty seven billion end up smuggled into

1546
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,570
Brazil and the other countries and

1547
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:33,490
that's identity at the at the light of

1548
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:36,510
the Sun so everybody can see it but you

1549
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:38,879
have other examples and in Belorussia

1550
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:41,800
which also on the Middle East in Dubai

1551
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:44,020
this plenty of a cigarette producers

1552
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,869
Dubai which are producing there to

1553
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:49,869
basically export abroad and and do the

1554
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:50,520
EMAs know it that's a question you can

1555
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:55,150
answer

1556
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:58,060
any other questions audience anyone want

1557
01:03:55,150 --> 01:04:00,340
to contribute anything yes someone over

1558
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:03,090
there listen yes we're right at the far

1559
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,090
wall

1560
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,780
first thank you it's Matheny solutely

1561
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:17,930
from Germany I was we are currently

1562
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:19,880
running some projects on this issues not

1563
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:22,450
that deep as you did Peter Norman but

1564
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:25,040
we're just beginning and we had an

1565
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:27,259
interesting dinner session yesterday on

1566
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:28,580
this issue and first I would like to

1567
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:30,440
make just make some remarks on the

1568
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:32,420
discussions that took already place that

1569
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:34,610
I think it's it's it's a really good

1570
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:36,320
point when you name the people or the

1571
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:38,540
subjects that we talk about with the

1572
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:40,010
names that they give themselves so this

1573
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:43,130
is the model thing if you want to be a

1574
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:45,200
German Muslim you are onto a Muslim this

1575
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:47,990
is a new modern concept of identity we

1576
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,419
cannot pose identity upon them if they

1577
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:52,189
call themselves jihadis they are jihadis

1578
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:55,640
in my point of view that's how I treat

1579
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:58,520
people but that when they constitute

1580
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:00,350
their identity the second thing was the

1581
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:03,500
cyber caliphate we headed yesterday yes

1582
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:05,930
we will still have this ideology staying

1583
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:09,050
there and we will still have some

1584
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:11,180
veterans day they they are experienced

1585
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:13,640
in war zones so these two things will

1586
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:16,759
not go away the topic that I would like

1587
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:19,970
to hear maybe a little bit more about is

1588
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:22,730
the the state that you were talking

1589
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:25,580
about that is was different because it

1590
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:28,160
is a state it has a bureaucracy and it

1591
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:30,049
was the first time that that we see that

1592
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:33,350
flood of women because they wanted to

1593
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:35,360
build up a state to have to have a new

1594
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:36,860
community for Muslims and so on from

1595
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,050
their point of view more the Muslim way

1596
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:42,410
and yesterday we had a session here

1597
01:05:39,050 --> 01:05:44,330
where it was about the middle east so we

1598
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:46,220
heard that terrorism is very cheap I

1599
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:48,380
think radicalization is more expensive

1600
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:50,839
so to keep the whole thing running is

1601
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:53,450
more expensive but when we think that

1602
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:56,120
you have the geostrategic setting in the

1603
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:58,850
Middle East that the is only codes

1604
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:01,150
developed could only emerge and could

1605
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:03,009
only become as big because we had a

1606
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:05,570
sunni-shia divide

1607
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:07,220
reduced complexity now yesterday it was

1608
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:10,100
a whole hour that they were speaking

1609
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:13,370
about that but this that will not change

1610
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:16,490
as long as we will not change Iraq and

1611
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:19,880
the Syria setting so that many people

1612
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:22,578
who gave power to this kind of

1613
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:26,059
organizations in order to be represented

1614
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:28,339
in a kind of maybe sunni state it will

1615
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:32,749
not change and this makes then the

1616
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:34,339
question maybe we related closer to to

1617
01:06:32,749 --> 01:06:37,549
the subjects we are talking about today

1618
01:06:34,339 --> 01:06:40,160
so terrorist attacks in Europe are not

1619
01:06:37,549 --> 01:06:43,369
expensive yes and maybe it makes sense

1620
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,499
to look at the petty crime yes but the

1621
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:47,930
the broader movement and the narrative

1622
01:06:45,499 --> 01:06:50,538
and the future veterans and the future

1623
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:52,368
conflicts they will be invaded by these

1624
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:54,049
veterans because they are parasites of

1625
01:06:52,369 --> 01:06:55,759
war as I call them they appear

1626
01:06:54,049 --> 01:06:59,829
everywhere where you have a conflict and

1627
01:06:55,759 --> 01:07:02,690
then you have an inflammation and and

1628
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:04,759
how can we how can we cope with a

1629
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:07,640
situation in the Middle East and bring

1630
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:10,339
it in relation to Europe thank you okay

1631
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:18,319
thank you so let's have a reply to that

1632
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:20,450
place Wow I mean having followed the

1633
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:25,219
turmoil in the Middle East for the past

1634
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:28,129
six years I'm very I'm very humble and

1635
01:07:25,219 --> 01:07:30,769
very modest when it comes to predictions

1636
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:33,529
because I've seen the past six years so

1637
01:07:30,769 --> 01:07:36,499
many experts that I truly respect as

1638
01:07:33,529 --> 01:07:38,630
experts get it completely wrong I do

1639
01:07:36,499 --> 01:07:41,348
think what happens in the Middle East

1640
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:45,289
and again that is my opinion

1641
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:48,079
is a truly historical transformation

1642
01:07:45,289 --> 01:07:51,349
that is perhaps in some ways comparable

1643
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:56,359
to the 30-year war in Europe in the 17th

1644
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:58,460
century and just like no one knew in the

1645
01:07:56,359 --> 01:08:00,979
middle of the 30-year war that it would

1646
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:03,410
one day become the 30-year war and what

1647
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:06,499
would be at the end of it I don't think

1648
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:09,410
anyone can say with certainty what will

1649
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:12,890
be at the end of this truly historical

1650
01:08:09,410 --> 01:08:15,618
transformation Isis is only one aspect

1651
01:08:12,890 --> 01:08:18,559
of it we have as you pointed out a

1652
01:08:15,619 --> 01:08:20,359
sectarian conflict we have internal

1653
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:23,359
conflicts within a lot of countries

1654
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:25,130
between author Terry ins Islamists

1655
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:27,799
representatives or perhaps more

1656
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:30,020
democratic ideas we have a number of

1657
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:32,359
countries in which we have no effective

1658
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:33,240
governance and the conflicts seem to be

1659
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:36,930
particularly

1660
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:40,050
bad in those countries where several of

1661
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:42,720
these fault lines coincide so in Syria

1662
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:45,450
you have a conflict about governance you

1663
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:48,630
have a sectarian conflict and you have

1664
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:54,420
the jihadists in Yemen you have the same

1665
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:56,840
situation and I I'm not going to predict

1666
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:00,270
exactly what's going to come out of it I

1667
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:03,390
feel that probably whatever is going to

1668
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:08,220
come out of it will not resemble how we

1669
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:10,800
started in 2011 that I'm certain of and

1670
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:13,110
that's a really difficult challenge for

1671
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:16,170
policy makers in Moscow and in

1672
01:09:13,109 --> 01:09:18,000
Washington because a lot of policy has

1673
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:22,319
been geared essentially towards

1674
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:24,330
preserving the 2011 state order if we

1675
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,210
now accept that perhaps that cannot be

1676
01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:30,210
preserved should be continued to invest

1677
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:32,730
a lot of energy into keeping the borders

1678
01:09:30,210 --> 01:09:36,149
where they are or should we embrace and

1679
01:09:32,729 --> 01:09:37,859
form and shape a new order I don't know

1680
01:09:36,149 --> 01:09:39,359
the answers to that that's what I

1681
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:41,670
started with and that's how I'm gonna

1682
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:44,609
finish can I have someone else you're

1683
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:47,040
all in Sudan fictive get the microphone

1684
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:48,990
please okay on a sec to remind you that

1685
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:52,050
if we can focus on this particular

1686
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:53,849
subject on crime finance and the support

1687
01:09:52,050 --> 01:09:55,200
of terrorist entities thank you

1688
01:09:53,850 --> 01:09:56,760
it is leastly south course uh-huh yes

1689
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,559
sir I want to focus on Peters last

1690
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,870
question which is very provocative um

1691
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,970
Lisa said from the BBC I wonder if you

1692
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:06,180
could talk more broadly about the flows

1693
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:09,030
of money which are long known to have

1694
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:10,470
come from the wealthy Gulf states at

1695
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:11,880
this point but you mentioned the Afghan

1696
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:13,380
war the biggest movement of them there's

1697
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:16,830
been a lot of money going from wealthy

1698
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:19,590
Gulf states to Syria to Iraq to other

1699
01:10:16,830 --> 01:10:22,050
countries and that's both private

1700
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:24,360
through the foundations who fundraising

1701
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:26,070
at mosques and official now we're told

1702
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,750
in countries like Saudi Arabia that they

1703
01:10:26,070 --> 01:10:29,969
have stopped the official money going

1704
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:31,860
and that now they have tightened up on

1705
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,970
their financing so it's almost I was

1706
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,759
told in Riyadh it's almost impossible

1707
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:37,260
now to send money anywhere but yet the

1708
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,600
allegations both there and in other

1709
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,920
countries persist how important are

1710
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,690
these flows and of course this is even

1711
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,600
more important after the Riyadh summit

1712
01:10:42,690 --> 01:10:46,250
where there was a new

1713
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:48,260
Arab in Islam leaders standing together

1714
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:50,390
with President Trump to say they're

1715
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:52,880
going to fight extremism and the

1716
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:55,490
ideology thank you good can I briefly

1717
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,070
respond to that because that's a really

1718
01:10:55,490 --> 01:11:00,139
important point Li's because it's it

1719
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:02,990
goes back to the question before because

1720
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:05,450
ultimately it really again comes down to

1721
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:07,490
that tired phrase one person's terrorist

1722
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:09,710
is another person's freedom fighter and

1723
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:12,830
there are questions of legitimacy and

1724
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:16,880
certainly we we are quick to forget but

1725
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:18,950
in 2011 2012 the West supported the

1726
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:23,330
so-called rebels in Syria it is true

1727
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:25,340
that they radicalized since then but we

1728
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:27,410
should not be surprised that a lot of

1729
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:31,280
countries in the Gulf region essentially

1730
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:34,130
until 2013 14 essentially viewed the

1731
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:36,200
conflict in Syria as part of the larger

1732
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:39,830
confrontation between Sunnis and Shiites

1733
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:42,769
and being Sunni they basically supported

1734
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:45,440
everyone on their side some of that

1735
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:47,510
money ended up with extremists Salafist

1736
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:50,299
organizations and that's when they

1737
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:53,120
stopped they stopped it a lot of it did

1738
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:54,680
and they stopped it at the point when

1739
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,370
they realized that it would come back to

1740
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,820
haunt them

1741
01:11:55,370 --> 01:12:01,580
but essentially until 2013 it was

1742
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:04,250
essentially seen as supporting our side

1743
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:06,710
in a regional conflict and a lot of the

1744
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:09,230
charity is from Kuwait from Saudi from

1745
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:12,350
Qatar that were involved in funding the

1746
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:15,200
Opposition in Syria did so sometimes

1747
01:12:12,350 --> 01:12:17,330
with the explicit support of Western

1748
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,639
countries so let's not forget about that

1749
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:30,290
because our view of that conflict has

1750
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:33,190
changed too they bought so I get the

1751
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:35,810
difficult part of the question right

1752
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:37,429
look I mean first of all donor money is

1753
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:39,200
not necessarily only coming from the

1754
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:40,790
Gulf states right there is quite a lot

1755
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,090
of donor money actually coming out of

1756
01:12:40,790 --> 01:12:46,430
Europe sympathizes off of the Germans of

1757
01:12:44,090 --> 01:12:49,190
the French of the Italians of the of the

1758
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:51,830
UK guys who are fighting with ISIL right

1759
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:54,110
and and the Secretary General at the end

1760
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:55,790
of this month in a report that we helped

1761
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:56,889
him draft is going to highlight the

1762
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:58,959
problem of debt

1763
01:12:56,889 --> 01:13:00,729
bank accounts where European foreign

1764
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:03,610
fighters maintain their personal bank

1765
01:13:00,729 --> 01:13:06,219
accounts and sympathizers put money in

1766
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:08,289
those bank accounts in Germany in UK in

1767
01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:11,199
Italy in France and it gets withdrawn

1768
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:13,929
outside the conflict zone by by simply

1769
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:15,938
using their normal bank card right so

1770
01:13:13,929 --> 01:13:17,919
that's an easy nice way to transfer

1771
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:19,659
money using the official banking system

1772
01:13:17,919 --> 01:13:21,729
where all of the controls fails because

1773
01:13:19,659 --> 01:13:23,888
no money moves goes in the account and

1774
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:25,030
out of the account so that's financing

1775
01:13:23,889 --> 01:13:27,130
that has nothing to do with the Gulf

1776
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:28,929
states that's coming out of Europe right

1777
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:32,139
simply using the fact that everyone in

1778
01:13:28,929 --> 01:13:35,469
Europe has a a bank account in a very

1779
01:13:32,139 --> 01:13:37,780
very smart way so it's not just a donors

1780
01:13:35,469 --> 01:13:39,610
in in the Gulf it's also donors in the

1781
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:42,099
Gulf and it used to be donors in the

1782
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:44,619
Gulf mainly for al-qaeda but as I said

1783
01:13:42,099 --> 01:13:46,899
so far currently and we're talking about

1784
01:13:44,619 --> 01:13:50,228
the risk assessment of charities not the

1785
01:13:46,899 --> 01:13:52,329
actual ongoing situation so far Aizen

1786
01:13:50,229 --> 01:13:54,579
has not put a large emphasis there was

1787
01:13:52,329 --> 01:13:56,289
always going donor money towards ISIL

1788
01:13:54,579 --> 01:13:58,840
and he continues to do so from

1789
01:13:56,289 --> 01:14:01,110
individuals but it has not yet set up a

1790
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,639
system like al-qaeda did when it was

1791
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:07,179
running the camps in Afghanistan where

1792
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:08,769
entire charities were set up under the

1793
01:14:07,179 --> 01:14:11,019
guise of doing good work in Afghanistan

1794
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:12,760
Waffen foundation right building roads

1795
01:14:11,019 --> 01:14:15,249
in Afghanistan and as a side job

1796
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:18,309
building building the camps of al Qaeda

1797
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:21,369
in Afghanistan that has not happened yet

1798
01:14:18,309 --> 01:14:23,709
but as the internal financial streams

1799
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:26,799
are going to get more difficult this is

1800
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:29,438
a potential that it's going to happen

1801
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,719
again Keith can I just interject with

1802
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:33,639
the question about that particular money

1803
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:36,909
Network supporters in Sheffield saying

1804
01:14:33,639 --> 01:14:39,340
getting money from abroad recycling the

1805
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:41,949
money from their own bank account in an

1806
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:44,889
English city somewhere hi is there any

1807
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:47,409
way to trace that and disrupt that

1808
01:14:44,889 --> 01:14:49,030
Network well I guess from a technology

1809
01:14:47,409 --> 01:14:52,058
perspective one of the things we

1810
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:53,530
advocate at Marcy colonies is improving

1811
01:14:52,059 --> 01:14:55,749
on security and a lot that each of them

1812
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:57,340
by how people access those financial

1813
01:14:55,749 --> 01:14:59,978
instruments so we're very much behind

1814
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:00,939
biometrics we believe that strategically

1815
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:04,449
where we need to go in terms of

1816
01:15:00,939 --> 01:15:07,269
improving security so I guess and I'm

1817
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:09,459
this is not my area of expertise but I

1818
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:10,280
suspect what all starts to see is the

1819
01:15:09,459 --> 01:15:13,099
fact that we will

1820
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,420
surely false people to be the only

1821
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:15,560
people who can access their bank

1822
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,720
accounts which is what I would like to

1823
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:19,220
have happen which means they then can't

1824
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:20,870
share those credentials is somebody else

1825
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:23,090
you can't move your fingerprint or your

1826
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:25,309
your retinas around other people to use

1827
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:27,170
so what we'll see is again by by having

1828
01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:29,120
the traditional banking systems the

1829
01:15:27,170 --> 01:15:31,340
security improved upon that will have an

1830
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:33,800
impact of squeezing the problem and it

1831
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:35,630
will go somewhere else and if I go back

1832
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,550
to the cache conversation but we'll

1833
01:15:35,630 --> 01:15:40,010
continue to do that and for me within

1834
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:42,050
within payments and selling MasterCard

1835
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:45,740
this to technology continues to improve

1836
01:15:42,050 --> 01:15:48,260
on that it just exposes so much of of

1837
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:50,059
criminality to being seen more obviously

1838
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:51,470
though I think that in this context

1839
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:53,540
we're going to see that start to happen

1840
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:55,100
that's shift where people won't be able

1841
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:56,210
to share those those financial

1842
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,880
instruments will go out really will push

1843
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:00,800
them back to going up get our cash it

1844
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:04,820
works and this gentleman here wants to

1845
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,470
thank you for that thank you and just

1846
01:16:04,820 --> 01:16:08,750
want to follow up on that point because

1847
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:12,680
I was at the previous session on

1848
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:14,510
artificial intelligence and it's we were

1849
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,310
talking about pity crime its shadow

1850
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:19,700
economy producing money for terrorism

1851
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:21,500
and I'm sure the text of this the

1852
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,929
financial veg dog so many organizations

1853
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:26,180
are dealing with these kinds of social

1854
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:28,160
activities so is it possible that

1855
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:30,470
finally we will produce a software or

1856
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,930
anything that can follow up on patterns

1857
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:34,460
of activities that you can showing that

1858
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:36,440
the basis to follow up so that when

1859
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:39,530
philip morris recognizes something and

1860
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:42,230
can you bring some really good examples

1861
01:16:39,530 --> 01:16:45,590
what has happened already in the past in

1862
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:47,870
an interagency operation of at that

1863
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:48,800
level that it's really pity crimes not

1864
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:51,559
gulf states

1865
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:54,500
pouring millions into Bosnia but but

1866
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:57,050
then these small things happen in our

1867
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:59,900
own country so we have the legal right

1868
01:16:57,050 --> 01:17:04,730
to act and to monitor but still we need

1869
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:06,500
an interagency operation I guess from a

1870
01:17:04,730 --> 01:17:08,419
financial perspective is we work very

1871
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:10,100
closely with your functional agency

1872
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:12,890
subject here in Europe with with Europe

1873
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:15,290
oh and they that I conduct very good

1874
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:17,420
organizing coordinating activities and

1875
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:21,200
certainly Interpol play that role as

1876
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:22,440
well so as an example then I will talk

1877
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,719
about

1878
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:26,820
the the movement of human beings around

1879
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,800
the world and using Airlines to conduct

1880
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:30,150
that and to move people around in

1881
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,619
Airlines you need to pay for that and

1882
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:34,670
traditionally you know they don't want

1883
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:36,929
cash they want electronic payments so

1884
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:38,760
it's gonna happen very shortly every

1885
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:40,860
year the payment industry gets together

1886
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:42,929
click collaboratively with the travel

1887
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,579
industry and the airline sector and we

1888
01:17:42,929 --> 01:17:46,349
law enforcement and we we partner

1889
01:17:44,579 --> 01:17:49,199
together to share real-time intelligence

1890
01:17:46,349 --> 01:17:50,670
on what we suspect to be people being

1891
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:53,040
moved from from one country to another

1892
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:54,420
either against their will or and be

1893
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,250
knowing me what they're going to end up

1894
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,480
arriving at to doing that in that sea of

1895
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:59,040
the country and we share that

1896
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:01,070
intelligence that's a model that we

1897
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:03,239
certainly endorse it mascot is a

1898
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:05,489
public-private partnership approach we

1899
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:07,379
mentioned earlier on and then we we do

1900
01:18:05,489 --> 01:18:09,629
similar things I mentioned Pangaea and

1901
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:12,239
illegal pharmaceuticals that ability for

1902
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:13,530
us to do that it's very powerful when we

1903
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:16,280
were very good at disrupting those

1904
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:18,360
networks and again what we do with that

1905
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:20,759
is what we learn for some very closely

1906
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,348
the byproduct or for that always is that

1907
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:24,119
eventually the organized criminals

1908
01:18:22,349 --> 01:18:25,440
working out the methods that we uses it

1909
01:18:24,119 --> 01:18:27,299
must be a mineral no and they'll come up

1910
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,980
with something else and what we're

1911
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:31,139
seeing in my industry is we're slowly

1912
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:33,570
pushing that out into areas where

1913
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:34,590
general consumers won't go and certainly

1914
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:37,679
some of the work we've done you

1915
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:39,480
mentioned that the shadow economy aim to

1916
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:42,389
cleaning this part of Europe and there's

1917
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:44,669
a huge amount of cash and money being

1918
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:47,730
moved around in shadow economy and that

1919
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:48,929
doesn't touch my payment system and we

1920
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:50,820
certainly advocate for the fact that the

1921
01:18:48,929 --> 01:18:53,190
more we can move cash out of the cash

1922
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:54,869
system into the electronic system we can

1923
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:56,159
continue to have that that working

1924
01:18:54,869 --> 01:18:58,500
relationship with law enforcement and

1925
01:18:56,159 --> 01:19:00,480
any governments and regulators as well

1926
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,650
to basically ensure that people who

1927
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,509
don't have access to financial

1928
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:05,610
instruments can get it in to the system

1929
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:07,559
they don't have to rely on cash and that

1930
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:09,089
then exposes that money for view of

1931
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:10,770
governments it wasn't where taxation and

1932
01:19:09,090 --> 01:19:12,750
that money can be taken back into the

1933
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:14,219
system and redeployed in invested where

1934
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:16,500
it's needed for the bed of the community

1935
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:18,659
so we try to play that that that will

1936
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:22,290
360 view at MasterCard

1937
01:19:18,659 --> 01:19:25,230
Wrigley yeah I finally I just remembered

1938
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:27,420
I once asked a former paramilitary how

1939
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:28,949
do you move money a but if you don't

1940
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:30,480
want to use the banking system if you

1941
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:32,009
don't have the beat Reyes and one thing

1942
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,949
he said a brilliant place to do this

1943
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:35,789
Neal bars by O'Neill bar because money

1944
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:36,989
is

1945
01:19:35,789 --> 01:19:38,670
moving all the time people are getting

1946
01:19:36,989 --> 01:19:42,018
their nails in every 15 minutes which is

1947
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:44,190
a great way to recycle the cash quickly

1948
01:19:42,019 --> 01:19:46,260
keep it propped up but actually leads to

1949
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:48,030
a question a more serious question but

1950
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:49,559
properly was mentioned there that

1951
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:51,599
somebody's in the audience mentioned

1952
01:19:49,559 --> 01:19:53,820
that we have a lot of examples in

1953
01:19:51,599 --> 01:19:55,469
Ireland were working active or

1954
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:57,058
underground organizations buy a lot of

1955
01:19:55,469 --> 01:19:59,639
property I mean I was in a restaurant in

1956
01:19:57,059 --> 01:20:00,900
Belfast two months ago and I imagined it

1957
01:19:59,639 --> 01:20:02,369
somebody's next member of the IRA

1958
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:06,058
Belfast for kidney says we will not

1959
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:07,199
guess we own that restaurant right now

1960
01:20:06,059 --> 01:20:08,909
that's been known for retirement

1961
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:10,768
purposes they've given someone a job but

1962
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:13,379
it's their restaurant is there evidence

1963
01:20:10,769 --> 01:20:16,019
that prop the property market around the

1964
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:18,840
world that organizations like Isis are

1965
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:21,570
moving into as well well there is one

1966
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,309
quite striking example it's not ISIL or

1967
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:25,619
qaeda related is actually Taliban they

1968
01:20:23,309 --> 01:20:28,469
parked I think about a hundred million

1969
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:30,449
dollars in a country in the specific by

1970
01:20:28,469 --> 01:20:32,099
basically using the immigrant community

1971
01:20:30,449 --> 01:20:34,138
and making them an offer that they can't

1972
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:37,050
review so you buy a house we give you

1973
01:20:34,139 --> 01:20:38,519
the money you can live in the house but

1974
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:42,210
even we need the money you will sell the

1975
01:20:38,519 --> 01:20:44,309
house and so the whole scheme broke down

1976
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:46,949
when it was clear that that entire

1977
01:20:44,309 --> 01:20:48,510
streets in one town were owned by Afghan

1978
01:20:46,949 --> 01:20:51,119
immigrants who had no conceivable

1979
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:54,900
economic way and all houses cost about

1980
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:57,719
half a million Australian dollars had no

1981
01:20:54,900 --> 01:21:00,329
conceivable way to actually earn that

1982
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:02,039
money to buy that house so this was a

1983
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:03,840
placement scheme but that's the only one

1984
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:05,880
that I'm aware of what this was done on

1985
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,099
a very large scale

1986
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:11,610
not to finance anything but to park

1987
01:21:08,099 --> 01:21:14,039
money for the time when it's needed and

1988
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:17,940
to make sure that you have it in a value

1989
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:19,980
that is likely to go up over time okay

1990
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,750
fascinating any other questions or

1991
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:24,768
points anyone from the audience what's

1992
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:24,769
the risk as one of the park here

1993
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:33,150
hi there and thank you very much for

1994
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:36,599
your respective inputs and if I may and

1995
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:39,449
focus on the nexus between crime and

1996
01:21:36,599 --> 01:21:42,329
terrorism or the man on which ie with

1997
01:21:39,449 --> 01:21:44,638
view as the terrorists appropriation of

1998
01:21:42,329 --> 01:21:48,389
criminal activities to follow the rims

1999
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:52,409
and I wonder if we should actually be

2000
01:21:48,389 --> 01:21:56,130
focusing on the enable us to both crime

2001
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:58,199
and terrorism and to that I'm thinking

2002
01:21:56,130 --> 01:22:00,869
about and you've discussed it between

2003
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:02,579
you and those individuals involved are

2004
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:06,119
limited only by their imagination

2005
01:22:02,579 --> 01:22:08,759
so how there is their funds will be from

2006
01:22:06,119 --> 01:22:11,670
Nike trainers from oil and everything in

2007
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:15,780
between so if you tackle the enables of

2008
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:18,690
transport of finance cyber as an enabler

2009
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:21,150
to our activity and tournament inhabit

2010
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:25,199
us you will impact on both the crime and

2011
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:27,989
terror Nexus the my question to you and

2012
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:31,500
following that theme is how much do you

2013
01:22:27,989 --> 01:22:37,440
see corruption as an enabler to both

2014
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:40,860
crime and terrorism yeah I always get

2015
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:43,049
the different questions yeah so it is

2016
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:44,909
corruption helping terrorism absolutely

2017
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:46,679
right what would be the eradication of

2018
01:22:44,909 --> 01:22:49,440
corruption go a long way to help the

2019
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:51,179
problem yes M is the eradication of

2020
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:53,428
corruption D going to be the end of

2021
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:56,670
terrorism no because it simply is an

2022
01:22:53,429 --> 01:22:58,260
enabler so yes there is a connection

2023
01:22:56,670 --> 01:23:00,179
there but I do fully agree with that

2024
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:03,119
that you need to target the facilitators

2025
01:23:00,179 --> 01:23:04,920
and that's what what my part of the

2026
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:07,110
Security Council that I'm advising is

2027
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:09,929
doing at the moment I mean we there is

2028
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:12,659
the global sanctions list against ISIL

2029
01:23:09,929 --> 01:23:14,460
and al Qaeda that has about 275 plus

2030
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:16,259
individuals at the moment on the list

2031
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:18,960
and the focus at the moment is

2032
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:23,210
distinctly on the financial facilitators

2033
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:25,860
of whatever kind be it um smugglers or

2034
01:23:23,210 --> 01:23:28,199
Antiquity smugglers or oil smugglers or

2035
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:30,389
money service providers that they deal

2036
01:23:28,199 --> 01:23:32,369
in a systematic way to transfer that

2037
01:23:30,389 --> 01:23:33,989
money to put them on a global sanctions

2038
01:23:32,369 --> 01:23:37,380
list because those facilities are

2039
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:39,509
supremely vulnerable to publicity so

2040
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:40,270
it's not about what Member States do to

2041
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:42,070
implement the

2042
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:45,010
sanctions is simply the fact that the

2043
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:46,809
name is on a globally available public

2044
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:49,240
sanctions list of the Security Council

2045
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:52,090
that says US ISIL are qaeda sanctions

2046
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:54,700
list that will really greatly reduce the

2047
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:56,740
ability to act as financial enable us

2048
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:59,080
because as the going between between the

2049
01:23:56,740 --> 01:24:00,849
terrorist groups and illicit economy

2050
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:02,380
they do need an address they do need the

2051
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:04,270
company potentially to loan the money

2052
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:05,620
and they do definitely need a bank

2053
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:07,330
account at one point or the other and

2054
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:09,550
all of these three things are much

2055
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:11,620
harder when your name is connected with

2056
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:14,110
with ISIL in a public manner so there is

2057
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:16,690
an instrument globally speaking that

2058
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:19,030
that can be used in a far more frequent

2059
01:24:16,690 --> 01:24:20,950
way that it's been done so far but we

2060
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:22,870
were trying to target exactly those

2061
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:24,550
individuals obviously what the

2062
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:26,290
Argentinian I think it's a very good

2063
01:24:24,550 --> 01:24:27,580
question about the enablers in the

2064
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:29,680
tobacco industry there are quite a few

2065
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:32,500
enablers if you just look at the trade

2066
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:37,350
in the distribution just give you two

2067
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:41,380
examples which happened quite recently

2068
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:44,380
ups big multinational company has been

2069
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:46,540
found find that 247 million dollars in

2070
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:47,980
the United States for shipping

2071
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:50,290
cigarettes from one country to another

2072
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:52,719
or the United States one nation to

2073
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:55,930
another of course the company was not

2074
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:57,760
aware of what they were transporting but

2075
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:59,500
their defense was that they were taking

2076
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,010
parcels with two or three bundles or

2077
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:06,220
small quantities and they were not

2078
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:08,560
legally in charge of having to check

2079
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:11,230
those inside the parcels and they got

2080
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:14,560
out the long process they got to find

2081
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:17,290
247 millions and and I think that's

2082
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:21,130
clearly showing that a camp like UPS can

2083
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:22,740
do more to control their supply chain

2084
01:25:21,130 --> 01:25:25,540
and what's what they're transporting

2085
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:28,540
they're gonna peel it but I think it's a

2086
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:30,580
sign that these logistic companies can

2087
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:33,100
play a role just like the credit card

2088
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:35,950
companies or another example is the

2089
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:37,900
shipping lines they are quite a few

2090
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:41,260
shipping lines but they're quite that

2091
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:44,920
there's a quite a concentration in

2092
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:47,829
on the freight transportation and this

2093
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:50,590
company signed in November of the CM

2094
01:25:47,829 --> 01:25:53,590
Brussels letter of understanding so an

2095
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:57,789
intention of together with many

2096
01:25:53,590 --> 01:26:00,670
producers of possibility consumer goods

2097
01:25:57,789 --> 01:26:04,059
like Philip Morris but also PNG Nestle

2098
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:08,289
and so on in order to do more to control

2099
01:26:04,059 --> 01:26:09,729
what's in their containers and I do

2100
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:11,018
think and it goes to back here what I

2101
01:26:09,729 --> 01:26:13,719
was saying at the beginning about the

2102
01:26:11,019 --> 01:26:16,300
public part public/private partnership

2103
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:20,619
I think multinational companies have a

2104
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:22,869
duty to do more to to control their

2105
01:26:20,619 --> 01:26:25,058
business whatever whatever business

2106
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:27,639
they're doing and whatever problems they

2107
01:26:25,059 --> 01:26:32,079
can have it and I do think that using

2108
01:26:27,639 --> 01:26:34,059
the typical carrot and stick can help

2109
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:36,518
multinational companies do the right

2110
01:26:34,059 --> 01:26:37,599
thing I'm going to see ask the last

2111
01:26:36,519 --> 01:26:40,119
question that's something that's

2112
01:26:37,599 --> 01:26:42,639
puzzling me we've had everything from

2113
01:26:40,119 --> 01:26:46,209
let's say Neil bars right up the oil

2114
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:47,170
production for financing terror and this

2115
01:26:46,209 --> 01:26:50,229
is a question and if you want to feel

2116
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:52,719
it's the last question what is going to

2117
01:26:50,229 --> 01:26:54,760
surprise us next what area of human

2118
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:57,760
activity and especially the financial

2119
01:26:54,760 --> 01:27:01,510
fetus is going to end up funding the bad

2120
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:05,650
guys and keep it brief if you commit to

2121
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:07,300
anyone honey I'll go first I'd more a

2122
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:11,619
personal opinion and omarska Bombur I

2123
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:14,489
think for me say Cuban I think it's the

2124
01:27:11,619 --> 01:27:19,030
the rapid growth of technology and

2125
01:27:14,489 --> 01:27:20,440
certainly in industry how some of the

2126
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:22,119
financial players struggle to keep up

2127
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,159
that growth and I think so I mentioned

2128
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:25,630
early fintechs as well there's new

2129
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:27,789
players coming into the financial sector

2130
01:27:25,630 --> 01:27:29,739
who've got no traditional retail banking

2131
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:31,300
or banking knowledge they they're just

2132
01:27:29,739 --> 01:27:34,268
they're just moving so fast with

2133
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:36,760
technology and in society the younger

2134
01:27:34,269 --> 01:27:38,949
generations are driving it so rapidly I

2135
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,409
think for me that will be the thing that

2136
01:27:38,949 --> 01:27:44,228
will surprise us most is the way that

2137
01:27:41,409 --> 01:27:45,940
technology will continue also rapidly it

2138
01:27:44,229 --> 01:27:47,409
will still continues allow the system to

2139
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:49,478
be exploited and that I don't really

2140
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:52,089
understand that you and your surprising

2141
01:27:49,479 --> 01:27:53,850
areas are well in my view that was gonna

2142
01:27:52,090 --> 01:27:56,040
surprise us to be honest the sort

2143
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:57,780
tip of the iceberg is the cyberattacks I

2144
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,700
think that's going to be something which

2145
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:01,620
is going to become much bigger in the

2146
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:04,290
future and I think we're just not

2147
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:07,920
prepared for it everything is much more

2148
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:09,720
you can control your house remotely with

2149
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,390
apps on your iPhone and so on your

2150
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:14,940
heater and but that couldn't that the

2151
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:17,730
securities on those on those apps and

2152
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:18,690
those services very very limited and I

2153
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:20,549
think we're going to be finding

2154
01:28:18,690 --> 01:28:22,139
ourselves in big big trouble going

2155
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:24,330
forward there are even the rumors

2156
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:25,860
apparently I'm steering that British

2157
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:29,130
Airways might have been under attack to

2158
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:30,780
date from cyber attack to so let's go a

2159
01:28:29,130 --> 01:28:32,580
food for thought but it disturbing all

2160
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:34,259
the same but I don't know but you I've

2161
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:36,960
found this fascinating it's opened up a

2162
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:39,360
whole new world a dark market if you

2164

discussion today on the nexus between

2166
01:28:43,130 --> 01:28:54,120
crime and terrorism in this century
